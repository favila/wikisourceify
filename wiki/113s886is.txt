{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain-capable unborn children in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act” .

=Sec. 2. Legislative findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds and declares the following:
:(1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the unborn child’s entire body and nerves link these receptors to the brain’s thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks after fertilization.
:(2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by recoiling.
:(3) In the unborn child, application of such painful stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress hormones known as the stress response.
:(4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in life.
:(5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia.
:(6) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, recent medical research and analysis, especially since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.
:(7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.
:(8) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.
:(9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain processing in early development differ from those of adults, using different neural elements available at specific times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing.
:(10) The position, asserted by some commentators, that the unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent the unborn child from engaging in vigorous movement in reaction to invasive surgery.
:(11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.
:(12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.
:(13) The compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither governmental interest is intended to replace the other.
:(14) The District Council of the District of Columbia, operating under authority delegated by Congress, repealed the entire District law limiting abortions, effective April 29, 2004, so that in the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal, for any reason, until the moment of birth.
:(15) Article I, section 8 of the Constitution of the United States of America provides that the Congress shall “exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever” over the District established as the seat of government of the United States, now known as the District of Columbia. The constitutional responsibility for the protection of pain-capable unborn children within the Federal District resides with the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] .

=Sec. 3. District of Columbia pain-capable unborn child protection=



==(a) In general– ==

Chapter 74 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1531 section 1531] the following:

<blockquote>

==Sec. 1532. District of Columbia pain-capable unborn child protection==



===(a) Unlawful conduct– ===

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any legislation of the District of Columbia under authority delegated by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , it shall be unlawful for any person to perform an abortion within the District of Columbia, or attempt to do so, unless in conformity with the requirements set forth in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1532 subsection (b)] .

===(b) Requirements for abortions– ===


:(1) The physician performing or attempting the abortion shall first make a determination of the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child or reasonably rely upon such a determination made by another physician. In making such a determination, the physician shall make such inquiries of the pregnant woman and perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as a reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical conditions involved, would consider necessary to make an accurate determination of post-fertilization age.
:(2) 
::(A) Except as provided in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1532 subparagraph (B)] , the abortion shall not be performed or attempted, if the probable post-fertilization age, as determined under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1532 paragraph (1)] , of the unborn child is 20 weeks or greater.

::(C) Notwithstanding the definitions of “abortion” and “attempt an abortion” in this section, a physician terminating or attempting to terminate a pregnancy under the exception provided by subparagraph (B) may do so only in the manner which, in reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive, unless, in reasonable medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk of—
:::(i) the death of the pregnant woman; or
:::(ii) the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant woman;than would other available methods.
