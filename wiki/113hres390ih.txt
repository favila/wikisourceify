Whereas the founders of the United States, recognizing the importance of a national system of mail to the new country, gave [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] the constitutional authority“To establish post offices and post roads”;   Whereas employees of the [[w:United States Postal Service|United States Postal Service]] provide indispensable public service and honorably represent the United States on a daily basis;   Whereas despite the other terrorist attacks in Federal facilities throughout the United States, including the anthrax attacks more than 10 years ago, Postal Service employees continue to risk their lives daily to serve the people of the United States;   Whereas Joseph P. Curseen, Jr., and Thomas L. Morris, Jr., both natives of Washington, DC, diligently and admirably served the Nation for decades as employees of the United States Postal Service;   Whereas in the fall of 2001, during the course of their jobs with the [[w:United States Postal Service|United States Postal Service]] , Joseph Curseen, Jr., and Thomas Morris, Jr., were exposed to letters containing anthrax that were placed in the mail and subsequently suffered from the inhalation of anthrax and thereafter died;   Whereas 5 United States citizens died from exposure to anthrax during the 2001 anthrax attacks and 17 became ill in the worst biological attack in the Nation’s history; and   Whereas in 2002, the United States Postal Service facility located at 900 Brentwood Road, NE, Washington, DC, was designated as the“Joseph Curseen, Jr. and Thomas Morris, Jr. Processing and Distribution Center”by [[Public Law 107-225|Public Law 107–225]]  : Now, therefore, be it

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] honors the lives and work of Joseph Curseen, Jr., Thomas Morris, Jr., the three Americans who died, and the 17 who became ill in the attacks, and acknowledges the sacrifice that all Postal Service employees make on behalf of the United States on a daily basis.
