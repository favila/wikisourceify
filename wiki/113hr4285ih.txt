{{Center|A BILL}}

 To facilitate State and local governmental entities in developing and implementing private sector job creating programs through local government financing of the installation of energy efficiency, water conservation, and renewable energy generation improvements on privately owned property with the financing to be repaid from assessments that may be levied on the local property tax bill, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   PACE Assessment Protection Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Congressional findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that the legislatures of 31 States and the District of Columbia have determined that there exist job creation benefits, other economic benefits, and significant other public benefits from the installation of improvements encouraged by local government finance programs, and have therefore enacted legislation authorizing their State and local governments to develop and implement programs under which such State and local governments finance the installation of the improvements on private property and the property owners may pay the financing costs on the property tax bill. Such legislatures include Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, DC, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

==(b) Purpose– ==

It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that PACE programs which incorporate prudent programmatic safeguards to protect the interest of mortgage holders and property owners remain viable as a potential avenue for States and local governments to achieve the many public benefits associated with energy efficiency, water efficiency, and renewable energy retrofits. In addition, it is essential that the power and authority of State and local governments to exercise their longstanding and traditional powers to levy taxes for public purposes not be impeded.
