[[w:Jim Bridenstine|Mr. Bridenstine]](for himself and
[[w:Henry Cuellar|Mr. Cuellar]]) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]] }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To streamline the collection and distribution of government information.   

=Section 1. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:National Technical Information Service|National Technical Information Service]](referred to in this Act as“NTIS”), the [[w:National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives and Records Administration]], the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]](referred to in this section as“  [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] ”), and the [[w:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]]all collect, categorize, and distribute government information.
:(2)   [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]was established in 1950, more than 40 years before the creation of the Internet.
:(3)   [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]is tasked with collecting and distributing government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information and reports.
:(4)   [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]]found that [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]sold only 8 percent of the 2,500,000 reports in its collection between 1995 and 2000.
:(5) A November 2012 [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]]review of [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]made the following conclusions:
::(A)  “Of the reports added to [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]’s repository during fiscal years 1990 through 2011, [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]]estimates that approximately 74 percent were readily available from other public sources.”.
::(B)  “These reports were often available either from the issuing organization’s website, the Federal Internet portal (http://www.USA.gov) or from another source located through a web search.”.
::(C)  “<nowiki>The source that most often had the report [</nowiki> [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]]] was searching for was another website located through http://www.Google.com.”.
::(D)  “95 percent of the reports available from sources other than [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]were available free of charge.”.
:(6) No Federal agency should use taxpayer dollars to purchase a report from the [[w:National Technical Information Service|National Technical Information Service]]that is available through the Internet for free.
:(7) As far back as 1999, [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]William Daley—
::(A) admitted that the [[w:National Technical Information Service|National Technical Information Service]]would eventually outlive its usefulness and be unable to sustain its revenue-losing profit model;
::(B) explained that“declining sales revenues soon would not be sufficient to recover all of [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]’ operating costs”; and
::(C) attributed this“decline to other agencies’ practice of making their research results available to the public for free through the Web”.
:(8) According to the November 2012 [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]]report—
::(A)  “  [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]product expenditures exceeded revenues for 10 out of the past 11 fiscal years.”;
::(B)  “The agency lost, on average, about $1.3 million over the last 11 years on its products.”; and
::(C)  “The decline in revenue for its products continues to call into question whether [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]’s basic statutory function of acting as a self-financing repository and disseminator of scientific and technical information is still viable.”.
:(9)   [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]has compensated for its lost revenue by charging other Federal agencies for various services that are not associated with [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]’s primary mission.
:(10) Future technological advances will ensure that the services offered by [[w:National Technical Information Service|NTIS]]are even more superfluous for essential government functions than they are today.
