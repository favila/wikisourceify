=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Major earthquakes are likely in the United States. For example, the [[w:United States Geological Survey|United States Geological Survey]] predicts that there is a 99.7 percent chance that a magnitude 6.7 earthquake will strike in California in the next 30 years and that there is a 46 percent chance that a magnitude 7.5 earthquake will strike in California in the next 30 years. Earthquakes can be caused by volcanic or tectonic events and result in destructive shaking of the earth, fires, landslides, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis.
:(2) Despite the known risk of earthquakes, relatively few homeowners have earthquake insurance. For example, in California, 88 percent of homes insured for fire do not have earthquake insurance. In the event of a catastrophic earthquake, the lack of homeowner earthquake-insurance coverage will slow recovery, create economic hardship, and increase the risk of mortgage and other credit defaults and adversely affect the banking system of the United States.
:(3) It is important that States improve the affordability, availability, and quality of earthquake insurance so that more homeowners will purchase coverage. For example, California has created the California Earthquake Authority to provide earthquake insurance to homeowners through private-sector insurers.
:(4) It is a proper role of the Federal Government to help prepare and protect its citizens from catastrophes such as earthquakes and to facilitate consumer protection, victim assistance, and individual and community recovery, including financial recovery.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are to establish a program—
:(1) to promote the availability of private capital to provide liquidity and capacity to State earthquake insurance programs; and
:(2) to expedite the payment of claims under State earthquake insurance programs and better assist the financial recovery from significant earthquakes by authorizing the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to guarantee debt for such purposes.
