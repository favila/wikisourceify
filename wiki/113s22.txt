{{section|id102B1E070A0B422899D33B4F4014F746|2. Gun show background check}}
(a)
Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
approximately
			 5,200 traditional gun shows are held annually across the United States,
			 attracting thousands of attendees per show and hundreds of Federal firearms
			 licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers;

(2)
traditional gun
			 shows, as well as flea markets and other organized events, at which a large
			 number of firearms are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and
			 nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the national firearms
			 market;

(3)
firearms and
			 ammunition that are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange at gun shows,
			 flea markets, and other organized events move easily in and substantially
			 affect interstate commerce;

(4)
in fact, even
			 before a firearm is exhibited or offered for sale or exchange at a gun show,
			 flea market, or other organized event, the gun, its component parts,
			 ammunition, and the raw materials from which it is manufactured have moved in
			 interstate commerce;

(5)
gun shows, flea
			 markets, and other organized events at which firearms are exhibited or offered
			 for sale or exchange provide a convenient and centralized commercial location
			 at which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often without background
			 checks and without records that enable gun tracing;

(6)
at gun shows,
			 flea markets, and other organized events at which guns are exhibited or offered
			 for sale or exchange, criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns
			 without background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be traced to
			 later commit crimes;

(7)
since the
			 enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act
 (Public Law 103–159
; 107
			 Stat. 1536
)
 in 1993, over 100,000,000 background checks have been performed by
			 Federal firearms licensees, denying guns to more than 1,600,000 illegal
			 buyers;

(8)
many persons who
			 buy and sell firearms at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events
			 cross State lines to attend these events and engage in the interstate
			 transportation of firearms obtained at these events;

(9)
gun violence is a
			 pervasive, national problem that is exacerbated by the availability of guns at
			 gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events;

(10)
firearms
			 associated with gun shows have been transferred illegally to residents of
			 another State by Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers,
			 and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug offenses, crimes of
			 violence, property crimes, and illegal possession of firearms by felons and
			 other prohibited persons; and

(11)
Congress has the
			 power, under the interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the
			 Constitution of the United States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that
			 criminals and other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms at gun shows,
			 flea markets, and other organized events.


(b)
