====(1) In general– ====

The [[w:|Commission]]shall conduct a review of the Code of Federal Regulations to identify rules and sets of rules that collectively implement a regulatory program that should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to the economy. The [[w:|Commission]]shall give priority in its review to rules or sets of rules that are major rules or include major rules, have been in effect more than 15 years, impose paperwork burdens that could be reduced substantially without significantly diminishing regulatory effectiveness, impose disproportionately high costs on entities that qualify as small entities within the meaning of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/601  section 601(6)of title 5, United States Code], or could be strengthened in their effectiveness while reducing regulatory costs. The [[w:|Commission]]shall have as its goal to achieve a reduction of at least 15 percent in the cumulative costs of Federal regulation with a minimal reduction in the overall effectiveness of such regulation.

====(2) Nature of review– ====

To identify which rules and sets of rules should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to the economy, the [[w:|Commission]]shall apply the following criteria:
:(A) Whether the original purpose of the rule or set of rules was achieved, and the rule or set of rules could be repealed without significant recurrence of adverse effects or conduct that the rule or set of rules was intended to prevent or reduce.
:(B) Whether the implementation, compliance, administration, enforcement or other costs of the rule or set of rules to the economy are not justified by the benefits to society within the United States produced by the expenditure of those costs.
:(C) Whether the rule or set of rules has been rendered unnecessary or obsolete, taking into consideration the length of time since the rule was made and the degree to which technology, economic conditions, market practices, or other relevant factors have changed in the subject area affected by the rule or set of rules.
:(D) Whether the rule or set of rules is ineffective at achieving the rule or set’s purposes.
:(E) Whether the rule or set of rules overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts with other Federal rules, and to the extent feasible, with State and local governmental rules.
:(F) Whether the rule or set of rules has excessive compliance costs or is otherwise excessively burdensome, as compared to alternatives that—
::(i) specify performance objectives rather than conduct or manners of compliance;
::(ii) establish economic incentives to encourage desired behavior;
::(iii) provide information upon which choices can be made by the public;
::(iv) incorporate other innovative alternatives rather than agency actions that specify conduct or manners of compliance; or
::(v) could in other ways substantially lower costs without significantly undermining effectiveness.
:(G) Whether the rule or set of rules inhibits innovation in or growth of the United States economy, such as by impeding the introduction or use of safer or equally safe technology that is newer or more efficient than technology required by or permissible under the rule or set of rules.
:(H) Whether or not the rule or set of rules harms competition within the United States economy or the international economic competitiveness of enterprises or entities based in the United States.
:(I) Such other criteria as the [[w:|Commission]]devises to identify rules and sets of rules that can be repealed to eliminate or reduce unnecessarily burdensome costs to the United States economy.

====(3) Methodology for review– ====

The [[w:|Commission]]shall establish a methodology for conducting its review (including its overall review and discrete reviews of portions of the Code of Federal Regulations), identifying rules and sets of rules, and classifying rules under this subsection and publish the terms of its methodology in the Federal Register and on an Internet Website of the [[w:|Commission]]. The [[w:|Commission]]may propose and seek public comment on the methodology before the methodology is established.

====(4) Classification of rules and sets of rules– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

After completion of any review of rules or sets of rules under paragraph (2) , the [[w:|Commission]]shall classify each rule or set of rules identified in the review to qualify for recommended repeal as either a rule or set of rules—
:(i) on which immediate action to repeal is recommended; or
:(ii) that should be eligible for repeal under regulatory cut-go procedures under title II.

=====(B) Decisions by majority– =====

Each decision by the [[w:|Commission]]to identify a rule or set of rules for classification under this paragraph, and each decision whether to classify the rule or set of rules under subparagraph (A)(i) or, instead, subparagraph (A)(ii) , shall be made by a simple majority vote of the [[w:|Commission]].

====(5) Initiation of review by other persons– ====



=====(A) In general– =====
