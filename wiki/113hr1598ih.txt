{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue, upon request, veteran identification cards to certain veterans.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Veteran’s I.D. Card Act” .

=Sec. 2. Veterans identification card=



==(a) Findings– ==

Congress finds the following:
:(1) Currently, veteran identification cards are issued to veterans who have either completed the statutory time-in-service requirement for retirement from the Armed Forces or who have received a medical-related discharge from the Armed Forces.
:(2) A veteran who has served a minimum obligated time in service, but who does not meet the criteria described in paragraph (1), does not receive a means of identifying the veteran’s status as a veteran other than using the official DD–214 discharge papers of the veteran.
:(3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often offered by public and private institutions to veterans who demonstrate proof of service in the military but it is impractical for a veteran to always carry official DD–214 discharge papers to demonstrate such proof.
:(4) A general purpose veteran identification card made available to a veteran who does not meet the criteria described in paragraph (1)would be useful to such veteran in order to demonstrate the status of the veteran without having to carry and use official DD–214 discharge papers.
:(5) The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] has the infrastructure in place across the United States to produce photographic identification cards and accept a small payment to cover the cost of these cards.

==(b) Provision of veteran identification cards– ==

Chapter 57of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding after [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/5705 section 5705] the following new section:
