[[w:Louise Slaughter|Ms. Slaughter]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]  }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to preserve the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials used in the treatment of human and animal diseases.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds the following:
:(1) 
::(A) In 1977, the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] concluded that feeding livestock low doses of antibiotics used in human disease treatment could promote the development of antibiotic-resistance in bacteria. However, the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] did not act in response to these findings, despite laws requiring the agency to do so.
::(B) In 2012, the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] was ordered by a Federal court to address the use of antibiotics in livestock, as the result of a lawsuit filed against the agency citing the agency’s failure to act in response to the 1977 findings.
:(2) 
::(A) In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences noted that antibiotic-resistant bacteria generate a minimum of $4,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 in costs to United States society and individuals yearly.
::(B) In 2009, Cook County Hospital and the Alliance for Prudent Use of Antibiotics estimated that the total health care cost of antibiotic resistant infections in the United States was between $16,600,000,000 and $26,000,000,000 annually.
:(3) An April 1999 study by the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] concluded that resistant strains of 3 microorganisms that cause food-borne illness or disease in humans (Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli) are linked to the use of antibiotics in animals.
:(4) 
::(A) Large-scale, voluntary surveys by the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] ’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in 1999, 2001, and 2006 revealed that—
:::(i) 84 percent of grower-finisher swine farms, 83 percent of cattle feedlots, and 84 percent of sheep farms administer antimicrobials in the feed or water for health or growth promotion reasons; and
:::(ii) many of the antimicrobials identified are identical or closely related to drugs used in human medicine, including tetracyclines, macrolides, Bacitracin, penicillins, and sulfonamides; and
::(B) these drugs are used in people to treat serious diseases such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, sexually transmitted infections, skin infections, and even pandemics like malaria and plague, as well as bioterrorism agents like smallpox and anthrax.
:(5) 
::(A) Any overuse or misuse of antibiotics contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, whether in human medicine or in agriculture.
::(B) Recognizing the public health threat caused by antibiotic resistance, Congress took several steps to curb antibiotic overuse in human medicine through amendments to the  Public Health Service Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/201 42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.]  ) made by  section 102 of the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act ([[Public Law 106-505| Public Law 106–505, title I]] ;114 Stat. 2315), but has not yet addressed antibiotic overuse in agriculture.
:(6) In January 2001, a Federal interagency task force—
::(A) released an action plan to address the continuing decline in effectiveness of antibiotics against common bacterial infections, referred to as antibiotic resistance;
::(B) determined that antibiotic resistance is a growing menace to all people and poses a serious threat to public health; and
::(C) cautioned that if current trends continue, treatments for common infections will become increasingly limited and expensive, and, in some cases, nonexistent.
:(7) The [[w:United States Geological Survey|United States Geological Survey]] reported in March 2002 that—
::(A) antibiotics were present in 48 percent of the streams tested nationwide; and
::(B) almost half of the tested streams were downstream from agricultural operations.
:(8) The peer-reviewed journal“Clinical Infectious Diseases”published a report in June 2002 that—
::(A) was based on a 2-year review by experts in human and veterinary medicine, public health, microbiology, biostatistics, and risk analysis, of more than 500 scientific studies on the human health impacts of antimicrobial use in agriculture; and
::(B) recommended that antimicrobial agents should no longer be used in agriculture in the absence of disease, but should be limited to therapy for diseased individual animals and prophylaxis when disease is documented in a herd or flock.
:(9) In a March 2003 report, the National Academy of Sciences stated that—
::(A) a decrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will have little effect on the current situation; and
::(B) substantial efforts must be made to decrease inappropriate overuse in animals and agriculture.
:(10) The  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/301 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] )—
::(A) requires that all drugs be shown to be safe before the drugs are approved; and
::(B) places the burden on manufacturers to account for health consequences and prove safety.
:(11) 
::(A) In 2003, the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] modified the drug approval process for antibiotics to recognize the development of resistant bacteria as an important aspect of safety, but most antibiotics currently used in animal production systems for nontherapeutic purposes were approved before the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] began considering resistance during the drug-approval process.
::(B) The [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] has not established a schedule for reviewing those existing approvals.
:(12) 
::(A) In an April 2004 report, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] —
:::(i) concluded that Federal agencies do not collect the critical data on antibiotic use in animals that they need to support research on human health risks; and
:::(ii) recommended that the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] develop and implement a plan to collect data on antibiotic use in animals.
::(B) In a September 2011 update to that report, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] —
:::(i) concluded that Federal agencies had made limited progress in addressing antibiotic use in animals;
:::(ii) recommended that Federal agencies fund research on alternatives to current antibiotic use practices; and
:::(iii) recommended that Federal agencies track the effectiveness of policies that curb antibiotic resistance, including [[w:Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] ’s voluntary guidelines reducing antibiotic use in food animals.
:(13) In 2009, the Congressional Research Service concluded that without restrictions on the use of antimicrobial drugs in the production of livestock, export markets for livestock and poultry could be negatively impacted due to restrictions on the use of antibiotics in other nations.
:(14) In 2010, the peer-reviewed journal“Molecular Cell”published a study demonstrating that low-dosage use of antibiotics causes a dramatic increase in genetic mutation, raising new concerns about the agricultural practice of using low-dosage antibiotics in order to stimulate growth promotion and routinely prevent disease in unhealthy conditions.
:(15) In 2010, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration testified that the Danish ban of the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food animal production resulted in a marked reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial species, including Campylobacter and Enterococci.
:(16) In 2011, the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] determined that—
::(A) 13.5 million kilograms of antibacterial drugs were sold for use on food animals in the United States in 2010;
::(B) 3.3 million kilograms of antibacterial drugs were used for human health in 2010; and
::(C) therefore, 80 percent of antibacterial drugs disseminated in the United States in 2010 were sold for use on food animals, rather than being used for human health.
:(17) In 2011, a review of all scientific studies on antimicrobial use in farm animals, published in Clinical Microbiology Reviews, found that—
::(A) use of antibiotics in food animals leads to development of reservoirs of antibiotic resistance;
::(B) a ban on antibiotic use in food animals would preserve their use for medicine; and
::(C) a Danish ban on antibiotics in food animals resulted in little change in animal morbidity and mortality, and only a modest increase in production cost.
:(18) In April 2012, the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] issued voluntary guidance to industry on reducing antibiotic use in livestock and poultry. As part of that guidance, it summarized over 35 years of peer-reviewed scientific literature regarding use of antimicrobial drugs in livestock. As a result, [[w:Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] stated strategies for controlling antibiotic resistance are needed, and are seeking voluntarily limits on antibiotic use.
:(19) 
::(A) In January 2013, Consumer Reports published test results on pork products bought in grocery stores nationwide showing disturbingly high levels of Salmonella and Yersinia enterocolitica bacteria that were resistant to the antibiotics used to treat food borne illnesses. A 2003 Consumer Report study showed similar results in poultry products.
::(B) The [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] ’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System routinely finds that retail meat products are contaminated with bacteria (including the foodborne pathogens Campylobacter and Salmonella) that are resistant to antibiotics important in human medicine. The 2011 National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System report found that the percentage of meat containing antibiotic resistant bacteria increases each year and that many of these bacteria exhibit multiple antibiotic resistance.
:(20) Antibiotic resistance, resulting in a reduced number of effective antibiotics, may significantly impair the ability of the United States to respond to terrorist attacks involving bacterial infections or a large influx of hospitalized patients.
:(21) Many scientific studies confirm that the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in agricultural animals contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in people.
:(22) Epidemiological research has shown that resistant Salmonella and Campylobacter infections are associated with increased numbers of ill patients and bloodstream infections, and increased death.
:(23) The American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, and the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition are among the over 400 organizations representing health, consumer, agricultural, environmental, humane, and other interests that have supported enactment of legislation to phase out nontherapeutic use in farm animals of medically important antimicrobials.

====(6) Definition– ====

In this subsection:
:(A) The term medically important antimicrobial means a drug that—
::(i) is intended for use in food-producing animals; and
::(ii) is composed wholly or partly of—
:::(I) any kind of penicillin, tetracycline, macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin, aminoglycoside, sulfonamide, or cephalosporin; or
:::(II) a drug from an antimicrobial class that is listed as“highly important”,“critically important”, or“important”by the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] in the latest edition of its publication entitled“Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine”(or a successor publication).
:(B) The term therapeutic use , with respect to a medically important antimicrobial, means the use of antimicrobials for the specific purpose of treating an animal with a documented disease or infection. Such term does not include the continued use of such an antimicrobial in the animal after the disease or infection is resolved.
:(C) The term nontherapeutic use —
::(i) means administration of antibiotics to an animal through feed and water (or, in poultry hatcheries, through any means) for purposes (such as growth promotion, feed efficiency, weight gain, or disease prevention) other than therapeutic use or nonroutine disease control; and
::(ii) includes any repeated or regular pattern of use of medically important antimicrobials for purposes other than therapeutic use or nonroutine disease control.
:(D) The term noncustomary situation does not include normal or standard practice and conditions on the premises that facilitate the transmission of disease.
:(E) The term nonroutine disease control means the use of antibiotics on an animal that is not sick but where it can be shown that a particular disease or infection is present, or is likely to occur because of a specific, noncustomary situation, on the premises at the barn, house, pen, or other level at which the animal is kept. .
