:(1) should not relinquish its long utilized authority vested in article 1, section 8 of the Constitution to “borrow money on the credit of the United States” by refusing to debate, amend, and vote on a bill to address the debt limit; and
:(2) should not provide the executive branch with exclusive power to issue debt on behalf of the United States Government.
