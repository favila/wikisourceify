To improve the energy and water efficiency of Federal buildings.

={{anchor|S1}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act”.

={{anchor|idDC164E08561E4A23BDDB8F1325553011}}Sec. 2. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to require the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] to audit the energy performance of buildings owned by the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] and identify—
::(A) steps that can be taken to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs; and
::(B) cost-savings that can be achieved by implementing energy efficiency measures;
:(2) to establish minimum efficiency standards for buildings leased by the Federal government;
:(3) to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution; and
:(4) to require regular reporting to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the public on the energy use of Federal buildings and the cost-savings and pollution reduction associated with efficiency measures.

=={{anchor|ide825e9e78fec4375a2cd1cd5ceea57c9}}(a) In general– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, each energy manager (as defined in section 543(f)(1) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/8253 42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(1)] )) of a building owned by the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] shall carry out an audit of that building that—
:(1) identifies any modifications necessary to improve energy efficiency that, within 10 years of implementation, will result in energy cost savings equal to the total investment made; and
:(2) quantifies the estimated cost-savings associated with any energy efficiency improvements identified by the energy manager.

=={{anchor|id54DE12258070455C9B1CBA6F64C54EF5}}(b) Report– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator of General Services]] shall report to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate]] and the [[w:United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives]] on—
:(1) all efficiency improvements identified in the audits carried out under subsection (a);
:(2) the total estimated cost-savings associated with the efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1); and
:(3) the status of implementation of the efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1).

In accordance with subsection (d), beginning 1 year after the date of enactment of thePromoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act, each lease of a building or space in a building entered into by a Federal department or agency shall include, except under the conditions described in subparagraphs (B) through (D) of subsection (b)(1)—
:(1) a maximum energy intensity standard;
:(2) a lighting efficiency requirement, accounting for appropriate task lighting; and
:(3) to the extent feasible, an incentive structure that allows the Federal department or agency leasing the building or space and the building owner to share the financial savings of efficiency investments and efficient operating practices.
