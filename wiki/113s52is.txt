{{Center|A BILL}}

To improve the energy and water efficiency of Federal buildings.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act” .

=Sec. 2. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to require the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] to audit the energy performance of buildings owned by the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] and identify—
::(A) steps that can be taken to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs; and
::(B) cost-savings that can be achieved by implementing energy efficiency measures;
:(2) to establish minimum efficiency standards for buildings leased by the Federal government;
:(3) to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution; and
:(4) to require regular reporting to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the public on the energy use of Federal buildings and the cost-savings and pollution reduction associated with efficiency measures.

=Sec. 3. Energy audits of public buildings=



==(a) In general– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, each energy manager (as defined in section 543(f)(1) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/8253 42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(1)] )) of a building owned by the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] shall carry out an audit of that building that—
:(1) identifies any modifications necessary to improve energy efficiency that, within 10 years of implementation, will result in energy cost savings equal to the total investment made; and
:(2) quantifies the estimated cost-savings associated with any energy efficiency improvements identified by the energy manager.

==(b) Report– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator of General Services]] shall report to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate]] and the [[w:United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives]] on—
:(1) all efficiency improvements identified in the audits carried out under subsection (a);
:(2) the total estimated cost-savings associated with the efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1); and
:(3) the status of implementation of the efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1).

=Sec. 4. Improving efficiency of leased buildings=

 Section 435 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17091 42 U.S.C. 17091] )is amended—
:(1) in subsection (b)(2), by striking “paragraph (2)” and inserting “paragraph (1)” ;
:(2) by redesignating subsection (c)as subsection (f); and
:(3) by inserting after subsection (b)the following:

<blockquote>

===(c) Other efficiency improvements– ===

In accordance with subsection (d), beginning 1 year after the date of enactment of thePromoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act, each lease of a building or space in a building entered into by a Federal department or agency shall include, except under the conditions described in subparagraphs (B) through (D) of subsection (b)(1)—
:(1) a maximum energy intensity standard;
:(2) a lighting efficiency requirement, accounting for appropriate task lighting; and
:(3) to the extent feasible, an incentive structure that allows the Federal department or agency leasing the building or space and the building owner to share the financial savings of efficiency investments and efficient operating practices.

===(d) Standards– ===



====(1) In general– ====

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator of General Services]] , on the advice of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] , shall issue minimum standards under paragraphs (1)and (2) of subsection (c)that are designed to improve efficiency in a cost-effective manner.

====(2) Updates– ====

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall periodically review the standards under paragraph (1)and make any recommendations to the [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator of General Services]] for revisions that the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] determines to be appropriate.

===(e) Report– ===



====(1) In general– ====

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection and every 2 years thereafter, the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director of the Office of Management and Budget]] , in coordination with the [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator of General Services]] , shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] a report describing—
:(A) the implementation by each Federal department or agency of this section; and
:(B) the extent to which each Federal department or agency has achieved compliance with the applicable requirements and standards of this section.

====(2) Relationship to existing reports– ====

A report under paragraph (1)may be incorporated into a related or similar report of a Federal agency prepared by that Federal agency to meet other similar requirements..

=Sec. 5. Leased building efficiency reporting=

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/3307 Section 3307(b) of title 40, United States Code] , is amended by striking [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/3307 paragraph (7)] and inserting the following:

<blockquote>
:(7) with respect to any prospectus for the construction, alteration, or acquisition of any building or space to be leased, an assessment of the future energy performance and water efficiency of the building or space, including, to the maximum extent practicable—
::(A) a description of the energy efficient and renewable energy systems, including photovoltaic systems, that are likely to be used in the construction, alteration, or acquisition of any building or space to be leased;
::(B) a description of the water saving technologies and systems that are likely to be used in the construction, alteration, or acquisition of any building or space to be leased;
::(C) the expected energy and water use intensity for the building or space, as compared to buildings of similar type and use;
::(D) a description of alternative workplace and other related strategies that are likely to be employed to minimize the space requirements and energy and water use of the building or space;
::(E) a description of the use of lifecycle cost analysis; and
::(F) if applicable, a description of any financing methods, such as energy service contracts, that are likely to be used for improvements described in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/3307 subparagraphs (A)] and [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/3307 (B)] ..
</blockquote>
