{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Calls on the Government of Turkey to allow free expression and Internet freedom.    Whereas an independent, unfettered media and freedom of expression, including the Internet and social media, are essential elements of democratic, transparent, and open societies;   Whereas millions of people in Turkey, including senior members of the Government of Turkey, use the Internet and social media to communicate on a daily basis;   Whereas the Government of Turkey imposed a countrywide ban on access to Twitter on March 20, 2014, and to YouTube on March 27, 2014, blocking the use of the communications platforms;   Whereas respected nongovernmental organizations have condemned the decision to block Twitter and YouTube as an attack on Internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey;   Whereas Twitter has been blocked in Turkey, China, Iran, North Korea, and Syria and YouTube has been blocked in Turkey, China, Iran, and Pakistan;   Whereas the Turkish Bar Association argued that the ban on Twitter is unconstitutional and in violation of Turkish and European human rights laws; and   Whereas on March 26, 2014, the Turkish district court in Ankara blocked implementation of the ban due to the restriction on freedom of expression and communication that are protected by the Turkish Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights: Now, therefore, be it
