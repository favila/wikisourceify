::(1) The present decentralized system for filing Federal tax liens in local property offices, which was established before the advent of modern computers, the Internet, and e-government programs, is inefficient, burdensome, and expensive.

:(b) Purpose– The purpose of this subtitle is to simplify and modernize the process for filing notices of Federal tax liens, to improve public access to tax lien information, and to save taxpayer dollars by establishing a nationwide, Internet accessible, and fully searchable filing system for Federal tax liens which would replace the current system of local tax lien filings.
