{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 38, United States Code, to eliminate the time limitation for use of eligibility and entitlement to educational assistance under certain programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Veterans Education Flexibility Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following::
:(1) According to the National Survey of Veterans, Active Duty Service Members, Demobilized National Guard and Reserve Members, Family Members, and Surviving Spouses Final Report , commissioned by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] in 2010, 20.6 percent of eligible veterans—approximately 2,621,753 veterans—were unable to use their GI bill educational benefits because their period of eligibility expired.
:(2) The time limitations for using GI bill educational benefits do not reflect the realities of the modern economy of the United States. After leaving the service, many veterans postpone further education to join the workforce and support their families or are faced with lengthy rehabilitations from service-related injuries.
:(3) Access to education and job retraining has proved the arbiter of success in today’s economy, and if the United States is to lower the unemployment rate among the veteran population, the United States must provide veterans unfettered access to educational benefits.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to remove the delimiting dates and retroactively restore the Department of Veterans Affairs Educational benefits within the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP), Montgomery GI Bill–Active Duty (MGIB–AD), and Post-9/11 GI Bill.
