{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a commission to study employment and economic insecurity in the United States workforce.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “National Commission on Employment and Economic Security Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Americans’ commitment to economic participation has been a defining feature of the cultural fabric of the United States, helping individuals feel positive about themselves, develop independence, and maintain hope for the future.
:(2) During the recession that began in December 2007, more than 8.7 million jobs were lost. The scope of the economic downturn was so large that its impact was felt almost everywhere along the economic spectrum, and continues to be felt in many communities across the Nation.
:(3) As Americans lose their jobs and their incomes shrink, too often, they also face the loss of their family’s health insurance and, subsequent to the loss of income, even their housing.
:(4) Research has shown that people who have experienced home foreclosure are at risk for severe depressive symptoms and increased risk for mental illness. In a 2009 study from the American Journal of Public Health, more than 37 percent of people going through foreclosure met criteria for “major depression” .
:(5) The loss of a job and the subsequent loss of income, insurance, and other benefits from that job have been proven to not only lead to increased stress but also be substantial triggers for mental health disorders including depression and anxiety.
:(6) Calls to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline increased by more than 72 percent from 2007 to 2010.
:(7) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate hovered between 8.9 and 10 percent from April 2009 to October 2011, peaking at 10.0 percent in October 2009. By October 2009, the number of unemployed persons had reached nearly 15.4 million, and has yet to fall below 11 million.
:(8) The number of long-term unemployed workers (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was 6.2 million in September 2011, an increase of 426 percent since the beginning of the recession in 2007. In August 2013, 4.3 million Americans were classified as long-term unemployed.
:(9) According to an American Psychological Association September 2010 report, money (76 percent), work (70 percent) and the economy (65 percent) remained the most frequently cited sources of stress for Americans at the height of the recession. A recent report from February 2013 found that even as the economy improves, these factors are relatively unchanged. Money (69 percent), work (65 percent), and the economy (61 percent) remain high sources of stress for Americans.
:(10) According to the same 2010 American Psychological Association report, job stability rose as a source of stress. Nearly half (49 percent) of adults reported that job stability was a source of stress in 2010, compared to 44 percent in 2009. During the same time period, fewer Americans were satisfied with the ways their employer helped them balance work and non-work demands (36 percent compared to 42 percent in 2009).
:(11) Research shows that time flexible work policies are associated with less stress, fewer absences from work, and more employer loyalty.
:(12) Between March 2010 and October 2013, there were 45 months of consistent job growth, with 7.8 million jobs created. During the same time period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 9.9 percent to 7.2 percent. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the unemployment rate will not fall below 6 percent until the end of 2016, and will remain above 5 percent through 2023.

:(3) analyze the psychological impact of increased workplace responsibilities and stress on current workers due to downsizing, and the role of workplace flexibility policies in alleviating stress on these remaining workers;
