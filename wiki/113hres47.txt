		Expressing the sense of the House of
		  Representatives that the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee, as an entity of
		  the United States Postal Service, should issue a commemorative stamp in honor
		  of the holiday of Diwali.
	
	
		
      Whereas Diwali, also referred to as the festival of
			 lights, is an Indian holiday that also marks the beginning of the Hindu
			 New Year;
		
    
      Whereas Diwali celebrates the triumph of good over evil,
			 the awareness of one’s inner light, the dispelling of ignorance, and bringing
			 peace and joy through the awakening gained from this higher knowledge;
		
    
      Whereas the holiday of Diwali is observed in America, and
			 across the globe, by Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, and Buddhists;
		
    
      Whereas as one of the world’s oldest religious holidays,
			 Diwali serves not only as a time for celebration, but also as a time for
			 communities and families to come together in spiritual enlightenment;
		
    
      Whereas the practice of Diwali has survived political,
			 economic and social changes throughout history, while always carrying the
			 universal symbolism of the victory of light, goodness, knowledge, and
			 truth;
		
    
      Whereas the 
                [[United States Postal Service|United States Postal Service]]
            , through the
			 decisions of the 
                [[Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee|Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee]]
            , has issued stamps for
			 other popular holidays in the United States, including Christmas, Kwanzaa,
			 Hanukkah, and Eid;
		
    
      Whereas the 
                [[United States Postal Service|United States Postal Service]]
             is yet to issue a
			 stamp in honor of the holiday of Diwali; and
		
    
      Whereas issuing a postage stamp honoring the holiday of
			 Diwali is fitting and proper: Now, therefore, be it
		
  
	
		
        =={{section|HA7A45ADE9BEC4A63BFF4453F00B668DE|
      
      That it is the sense of the 
                [[United States House of Representatives|House of
			 Representatives]]
             that—
			
        (1)
        the 
                [[United States Postal Service|United States

             should issue a postage stamp honoring the holiday of Diwali;

        the 
                [[Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee|Citizens'
			 Stamp Advisory Committee]]
             should recommend to the 
                [[United States Postal Service|Postmaster General]]
             that such a
			 stamp be issued.
