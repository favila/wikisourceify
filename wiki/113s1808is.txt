{{Center|A BILL}}

To prevent adverse treatment of any person on the basis of views held with respect to marriage.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Marriage and Religious Freedom Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Leading legal scholars concur that conflicts between same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be legislatively addressed.
:(2) As the President stated in response to the decision of the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] on the Defense of Marriage Actin 2013, “Americans hold a wide range of views” on the issue of same-sex marriage, and “maintaining our Nation’s commitment to religious freedom” is “vital” .
:(3) Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion is a Government interest of the highest order. Legislatively enacted measures advance this interest by remedying, deterring, and preventing Government interference with religious exercise in a way that complements the protections mandated by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
:(4) Laws that protect the free exercise of religious beliefs about marriage will encourage private citizens and institutions to demonstrate similar tolerance and therefore contribute to a more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.

=Sec. 3. Protection of the free exercise of religious beliefs=



==(a) In general– ==

Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the Federal Government shall not take an adverse action against a person, wholly or partially on the basis that such person acts in accordance with a religious belief that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage.

==(b) Adverse action defined– ==

As used in subsection (a), an adverse action means any action taken by the Federal Government to—
:(1) deny or revoke an exemption from taxation under  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501 section 501(a)] of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986of the person who is acting in accordance with the religious belief referred to in subsection (a);
:(2) disallow a deduction for Federal tax purposes of any charitable contribution made to or by such person;
:(3) alter in any way the Federal tax treatment of, or cause any tax, penalty, or payment to be assessed against, such person or such person’s employees with respect to any benefit provided or not provided by such person to such person’s employees, wholly or partially on the basis that the benefit is provided or not provided on account of a religious belief referred to in subsection (a);
:(4) deem any employee benefit plan covering employees of such person to have lost its status as a qualified plan under  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/401 section 401(a)] of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or to be in violation of any part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/1001 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq] .), wholly or partially on the basis that the benefit plan fails to provide a benefit, right, or feature on account of such person’s religious belief referred to in subsection (a);
:(5) deny or exclude such person from receiving any Federal grant, contract, cooperative agreement, loan, license, certification, accreditation, employment, or other similar position or status;
