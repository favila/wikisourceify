==(a) In general– ==

From the amounts appropriated to carry out this section, the [[w:|Secretary]]shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible partnerships to enable such partnerships to develop and operate a 4- or 6-year computer science career education program.

==(b) Application– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Each eligible partnership that desires to receive a grant under this Act shall submit an application to the [[w:|Secretary]]at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the [[w:|Secretary]]may require.

Each application submitted under paragraph (1) shall—
:(A) describe the eligible partners and partnership, the roles and responsibilities of each partner, and a demonstration of each partner’s ability to support the proposed program;
:(B) describe how the eligible partnership will implement a computer science career education program, as described in subsection (c) ;
:(C) ensure funding under the grant program is spent in a coordinated manner with other local resources;
:(D) describe the State or local workforce shortages, as determined by the relevant State agency in charge of workforce data, in the computer science sector;
:(E) make information, including career guidance and advisement resources, available about the program;
:(F) ensure non-duplication of the partnership's development of computer science career education programs;
:(G) ensure equitable access to the program; and
:(H) demonstrate alignment of the partnership's computer science career education program to the State or local computer science sector.

==(c) Content of computer science career education program– ==

An eligible partnership that receives a grant under this Act shall use the grant funds to develop and operate a 4- or 6-year computer science career education program that—
:(1) includes the development of computer science programs for both secondary education and postsecondary education that—
::(A) are aligned with rigorous computer science standards for kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education;
::(B) link secondary schools and institutions of higher education through non-duplicative sequences of courses in computer science career fields, including the investigation of opportunities for secondary students to enroll concurrently in secondary and postsecondary course­work;
::(C) use, if appropriate and available, work-based or worksite learning in conjunction with business;
::(D) use educational technology and distance learning, as appropriate, to involve all of the partners in the eligible partnership more fully in the development and operation of the programs;

:(3) includes career and academic counseling for the students that—
::(A) provides information to students regarding available computer science career education programs;
::(B) supports student progress in completing computer science career education programs;
::(C) provides labor market information on local, State, regional, and national computer science employment opportunities, such as occupation demand, education requirements, and expected compensation; and
::(D) tracks student placement in appropriate employment, or transfer to an institution of higher education; and
