{{Center|A BILL}}

To preserve American space leadership, and for other
		  purposes.


{{section|H7503C994C20A455D97121CC1F3850A7E|1. Short title}}
This Act may be cited as the
			 
          Space Leadership Preservation Act of
			 2013

        
.

{{section|H7A1A18FBF5814CCC875FC5651B2937B5|2. Purpose}}
The purpose of this Act is to ensure that
			 the American space program will always be the best in the world, and to ensure
			 that America will always be able to preserve and protect our leadership in the
			 exploration of outer space, the high ground of the future. [[United States Congress|Congress]] is hopeful
			 that by restructuring [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] we can make the Agency less political and more
			 professional so that visionary [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] scientists, engineers, and astronauts will
			 continue to inspire future generations by their continuing mission: to explore
			 strange new worlds, to seek out new life, to boldly go where no one has gone
			 before.
