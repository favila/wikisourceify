={{anchor|H7503C994C20A455D97121CC1F3850A7E}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Space Leadership Preservation Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H7A1A18FBF5814CCC875FC5651B2937B5}}Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the American space program will always be the best in the world, and to ensure that America will always be able to preserve and protect our leadership in the exploration of outer space, the high ground of the future. [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] is hopeful that by restructuring [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] we can make the Agency less political and more professional so that visionary [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] scientists, engineers, and astronauts will continue to inspire future generations by their continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life, to boldly go where no one has gone before.
