:(2) the long-term potential impact of the Basel III Rules, including changes to the current risk-weight framework;
:(3) the cost and complexity of the Basel III Rules for community financial institutions;

:(5) the historical probability of default and loss given default of residential mortgage loans and the proposed risk weightings in the Basel III Rules, and whether such proposed risk weightings are appropriately and fairly calibrated, specifically for community, mid-size, and regional financial institutions; and
