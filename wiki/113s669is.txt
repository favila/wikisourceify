:(2) By the end of the current tax return filing season more than 36,000,000 Federal individual income tax returns will have been prepared and filed electronically for free over the life of the IRS Free File program.
:(3) The IRS Free File program offers Federal individual income tax return preparation and electronic filing services to more than 70 percent of taxpayers, approximately 100,000,000 taxpayers at the end of the current tax filing period, with tax software and electronic filing provided at no cost to the taxpayers who use the service or to the Federal Government from tax software and electronic filing companies participating in the program.
:(4) By the end of the current tax return filing season, it is estimated that the IRS Free File program will have saved taxpayers approximately $1,000,000,000 and will have saved the Federal Government about $125,000,000 in processing costs.

:(c) The [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] shall continue to work cooperatively with the private sector through the Free File Alliance to provide free individual income tax preparation and electronic filing services and shall not compete with the private sector in providing these services to taxpayers, nor shall the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] acquire, develop, or deploy enabling systems to duplicate or replace private sector tax preparation services.
