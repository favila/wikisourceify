 To improve the understanding and coordination of critical care health services.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Critical Care Assessment and Improvement Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings; purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Critical care medicine is the care for patients whose illnesses or injuries present a significant danger to life, limb, or organ function and require comprehensive care and constant monitoring, usually in intensive care units (ICUs).
:(2) Each year, approximately five million Americans are admitted into adult medical, surgical, pediatric, or neonatal ICUs.
:(3) Critical care medicine encompasses a wide array of diseases and health issues. The care provided in the ICU is highly specialized and complex due to the extreme severity of illness of its patient population, often involving multiple disease processes in different organ systems at the same time.
:(4) Critical care medicine consumes a significant amount of financial resources, accounting for more than 17 percent of all hospital costs.
:(5) According to a recent study published in the Journal of Critical Care Medicine, despite the fact that cancer care and critical care place similar economic burdens on society, proportionally 3.1 to 11.4 times more research money was spent on cancer care research than critical care research.
:(6) According to a 2006 report by the [[w:Health Resources and Services Administration|Health Resources and Services Administration]]( HRSA ), demand in the United States for critical care medical services is on the rise, due in part to the growing elderly population, as individuals over the age of 65 consume a large percentage of critical care services.
:(7) The [[w:Health Resources and Services Administration|HRSA]]report also found that the growing aging population will further exacerbate an existing shortage of intensivists, the physicians certified in critical care who primarily deliver care in intensive care units, potentially compromising the quality and availability of care. Today, intensivist-led teams treat only one-third of critically ill patients despite substantial evidence that these teams lead to improved outcomes.
:(8) Ensuring the strength of our critical care medical delivery infrastructure is integral to the improvement of the quality and delivery of health care in the United States.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to assess the current state of the United States critical care medical delivery system and implement policies to improve the quality and effectiveness of care delivered to the critically ill and injured. 

=Sec. 3. Studies on critical care=



==(a) Institute of Medicine study– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]](in this Act referred to as the Secretary ) shall enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine under which, not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Institute will—
:(A) conduct an analysis of the current state of critical care health services in the United States;
:(B) develop recommendations to bolster critical care capabilities to meet future demand; and
:(C) submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]a report including the analysis and recommendations under subparagraphs (A) and (B) .

===(2) Issues to be studied– ===

The agreement under paragraph (1) shall, at a minimum, provide for the following:
:(A) Analysis of the current critical care system in the United States, including—
::(i) the system’s capacity and resources, including the size of the critical care workforce and the availability of health information technology and medical equipment;
::(ii) the system’s strengths, limitations, and future challenges; and
::(iii) the system’s ability to provide adequate care for the critically ill or injured in response to a national health emergency, including a pandemic or natural disaster.
:(B) Analysis and recommendations regarding regionalizing critical care systems.
:(C) Analysis regarding the status of critical care research in the United States and recommendations for future research priorities.

==(b) Health Resources and Services Administration study– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]], acting through the [[w:Health Resources and Services Administration|Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration]], shall review and update the [[w:Health Resources and Services Administration|Administration’s]]2006 study entitled The Critical Care Workforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand for Critical Care Physicians .

===(2) Scope– ===

In carrying out paragraph (1) , the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall expand the scope of the study to address the supply and demand of other providers within the spectrum of critical care delivery, including critical care nurses, mid-level providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), intensive care unit pharmacists, and intensive care unit respiratory care practitioners. 

=Sec. 4. NIH Critical Care Coordinating Council=



==(a) Establishment– ==

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]], acting through the [[w:National Institutes of Health|Director of the National Institutes of Health]], shall establish a council within the Institutes to be known as the [[w:National Institutes of Health|Critical Care Coordinating Council]](in this section referred to as the Council ).

:(4) the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institute of General Medical Sciences]];
:(5) the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institute on Aging]]; and
:(6) any other national research institute or national center of the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]]that the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]deems appropriate.
