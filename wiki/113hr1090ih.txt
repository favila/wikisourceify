To establish an Elementary Educator Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Content Coach program.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Elementary Educator STEM Content Coach Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Numerous recent reports by national advisory groups, including the President’s [[w:Office of Science and Technology Policy|Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] (PCAST) and committees of the National Academies, have highlighted the need to raise student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to enable the United States to maintain its competitive edge in the global economy.
:(2) The PCAST report entitled “Prepare and Inspire: K–12 Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) for America’s Future” states, “The most important factor in ensuring excellence is great STEM teachers, with both deep content knowledge in STEM subjects and mastery of the pedagogical skills required to teach these subjects well.”.
:(3) The PCAST report also recommends that the Federal Government should support the professional development of all teachers to help them achieve deep STEM content knowledge and mastery of STEM pedagogy.
:(4) The National Academy of Sciences finds that school districts need to enhance the capacity of kindergarten through grade 12 teachers with content knowledge and expertise in teaching in order to successfully promote effective STEM education in those grades.
:(5) The Center for American Progress finds that improving the elementary school teacher’s knowledge of STEM-related facts, concepts, and procedures is vital to our Nation’s global competitiveness in the 21st century.

=Sec. 3. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to create a cohort of elementary educators with a deep content knowledge in STEM disciplines by providing professional development to elementary educators.
