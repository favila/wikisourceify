====(A) In general– ====

When evaluating whether a State has substantially implemented this section, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall consider whether the State is unable to substantially implement this section because of a demonstrated inability to implement certain provisions that would place the State in violation of its constitution, as determined by a ruling of the State's highest court.

If the circumstances arise under subparagraph (A), then the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] and the State shall make good faith efforts to accomplish substantial implementation of this section and to reconcile any conflicts between this section and the State's constitution. In considering whether compliance with the requirements of this section would likely violate the State's constitution or an interpretation thereof by the State's highest court, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall consult with the chief executive and chief legal officer of the State concerning the State's interpretation of the State's constitution and rulings thereon by the State's highest court.

====(C) Alternative procedures– ====

If the State is unable to substantially implement this section because of a limitation imposed by the State's constitution, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] may determine that the State is in compliance with this Act if the State has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, reasonable alternative procedures or accommodations that are consistent with the purposes of this Act.
