==(a) In general– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] shall promulgate—
:(1) regulations that establish standards for the implementation of a mechanism by which an individual can simply and easily indicate whether the individual prefers to have personal information collected by providers of online services, including by providers of mobile applications and services; and
:(2) rules that prohibit, except as provided in subsection (b), such providers from collecting personal information on individuals who have expressed, via a mechanism that meets the standards promulgated under paragraph (1), a preference not to have such information collected.

==(b) Exception– ==

The rules promulgated under paragraph (2) of subsection (a)shall allow for the collection and use of personal information on an individual described in such paragraph, notwithstanding the expressed preference of the individual via a mechanism that meets the standards promulgated under paragraph (1) of such subsection, to the extent—
:(1) necessary to provide a service requested by the individual, including with respect to such service, basic functionality and effectiveness, so long as such information is anonymized or deleted upon the provision of such service; or
:(2) the individual—
::(A) receives clear, conspicuous, and accurate notice on the collection and use of such information; and
::(B) affirmatively consents to such collection and use.

==(c) Factors– ==

In promulgating standards and rules under subsection (a), the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] shall consider and take into account the following:

:(2) The technical feasibility and costs of—
::(A) implementing mechanisms that would meet such standards; and
::(B) complying with such rules.
:(3) Mechanisms that—
::(A) have been developed or used before the date of the enactment of this Act; and
::(B) are for individuals to indicate simply and easily whether the individuals prefer to have personal information collected by providers of online services, including by providers of mobile applications and services.
:(4) How mechanisms that meet such standards should be publicized and offered to individuals.

::(B) does not qualify as personal information subject to the rules promulgated under subsection (a)(2).
:(6) The standards under which personal information may be collected and used, subject to the anonymization or deletion requirements of subsection (b)(1)—

::(C) for such other purposes as the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Commission]] determines substantially facilitates the functionality and effectiveness of the online service, or mobile application or service, in a manner that does not undermine an individual's preference, expressed via such mechanism, not to collect such information.
