{{Center|JOINT RESOLUTION}}

Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to balance the Federal budget. That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years after the date of its submission for ratification:
  Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless two-thirds of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a roll call vote. The limit on the debt of the United States held by the public shall not be increased, unless two-thirds of the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an increase by a roll call vote.
 Outlays for the total budget may not exceed the previous fiscal yearsâ€™ outlays plus population growth and inflation, unless two-thirds of the whole number of each House shall provide for such increase by a roll call vote.
 Prior to each fiscal year, the [[Wikipedia:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives ]]shall develop a proposed budget for the United States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts. No bill to increase revenue shall become law unless approved by two-thirds of the whole number of each House by a roll call vote. The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]may waive the provisions of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect, with a vote of a majority of both houses. The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts. All outlays above revenues from the previous fiscal year must be accounted for in the outlays and budgets of the following fiscal year. All surplus revenues at the end of a fiscal year shall be allocated to a fund to be returned to the taxpayers. The method of return to the taxpayers must be determined by legislation before the end of the subsequent fiscal year. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States Government except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States Government including those for debt service and other debt functions. This article shall take effect beginning with the second fiscal year beginning after its ratification..
