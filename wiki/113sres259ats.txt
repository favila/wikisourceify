{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Designating September 2013 as “Campus Fire Safety Month” .Whereas recent campus-related fires at colleges in Massachusetts, Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, Kansas, and other States have tragically cut short the lives of several young people;Whereas, since January 2000, at least 162 people, including students, parents, and children, have died in campus-related fires;Whereas approximately 86 percent of those deaths occurred in off-campus residences;Whereas a majority of college students in the United States live in an off-campus residence;Whereas many fatal fires have occurred in a building in which the occupants had compromised or disabled the fire safety system;Whereas automatic fire alarm systems provide the early warning of a fire that is necessary for occupants of a building and the fire department to take appropriate action;Whereas automatic fire sprinkler systems are a highly effective method of controlling or extinguishing a fire in the early stages, thus protecting the lives of building occupants;Whereas many college students live in an off-campus residence, fraternity or sorority housing, or a residence hall that is not adequately protected by an automatic fire sprinkler system and an automatic fire alarm system;Whereas fire safety education is an effective method of reducing the occurrence of fires and the resulting loss of life and property damage;Whereas college students do not routinely receive effective fire safety education while in college;Whereas educating young people in the United States about the importance of fire safety is vital to help ensure that young people engage in fire-safe behavior during college and after college; andWhereas developing a generation of adults who practice fire safety may significantly reduce future loss of life from fires: Now, therefore, be it
