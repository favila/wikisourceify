{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for the designation of May 11, 2014, through May 17, 2014, as Food Allergy Awareness Week.    Whereas as many as 15,000,000 people in the United States, including nearly 6,000,000 children under the age of 18, have food allergies, which are potentially life-threatening;   Whereas data from the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]]shows a 50-percent increase in the prevalence of food allergies in children under age 18 from 1997 to 2011;   Whereas there is no cure for food allergy and limited understanding of the underlying reasons for the increase in prevalence of food allergies among children;   Whereas 8 foods, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, and wheat, cause 90 percent of all food allergy reactions in the United States;   Whereas strict avoidance of offending foods is the only way to prevent an allergic reaction;   Whereas reactions typically occur when an individual unknowingly eats a food containing an ingredient to which they are allergic;   Whereas the symptoms of a food-allergic reaction can include hives, vomiting, respiratory distress, swelling of the throat, anaphylaxis, and death;   Whereas anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death;   Whereas according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], food allergy results in more than 300,000 ambulatory care visits a year involving children under age 18;   Whereas those with food allergies and parents of children with food allergies develop plans for food allergy management that include prompt access to epinephrine;   Whereas Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), a national, nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure for food allergies, and to keep individuals with food allergies safe and included, recognizes and supports Food Allergy Awareness Week during May of every calendar year;   Whereas outreach and education to the public may improve the response to an allergic reaction;   Whereas public awareness of food allergies may also enhance the commitment to research to understand the causes for food allergies and interventions for allergic reaction; and   Whereas this year Food Allergy Awareness Week is recognized during the week of May 11, 2014, through May 17, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
