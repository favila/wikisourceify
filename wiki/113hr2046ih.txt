  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:

:(3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising the second amendment rights of the individuals while at such water resources development projects.
:(4) The Federal laws should make it clear that the second amendment rights of an individual at a water resources development project should not be infringed.

The [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary of the Army]]shall not promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm including an assembled or functional firearm at a water resources development project covered undersection 327.0of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act), if—
