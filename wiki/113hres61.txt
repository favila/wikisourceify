{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should work with the Government of Haiti to address gender-based violence against women and children.Whereas tens of thousands of women and girls have been victims of sexual or gender-based violence in Haiti, particularly in times of conflict or natural disaster;Whereas women’s rights groups in Haiti have witnessed dramatic increases in rates of sexual violence in many of the displacement camps established after the earthquake;Whereas approximately 50 percent of the victims are adolescent girls under the age of 18, with many of the cases involving the use of weapons, gang rape, and death threats for reporting the crime;Whereas medical providers have reported as many as 20 percent of adolescent victims of sexual violence becoming pregnant as a result of rape;Whereas inadequate financial, human, and technical resources, as well as a lack of forensic and technical expertise, have impeded the arrest and prosecution of suspects;Whereas members of many medical professions are insufficiently trained to attend to the special needs of victims of gender-based violence, whether they be children or adults;Whereas according to data from public interest law firms involved in prosecuting cases of sexual violence, significant gender-based barriers to justice continue to exist at all levels of the Haitian justice system;Whereas members of the police, prosecutors, and judges are insufficiently trained to attend to either the special needs of victims of gender-based violence, or the special needs of those individuals who are victims of other abuses such as forced labor, beatings, or violence;Whereas the special police unit to address gender-based violence within the Haitian National Police remains significantly under-resourced, rendering it practically ineffective to carry out its mandate;Whereas few mechanisms exist in Haiti to protect the rights of young children not living at home, such as restaveks, who are engaged in forced labor and especially vulnerable to sexual violence;Whereas the lack of physical protection discourages women and girls in Haiti from pursuing prosecution of perpetrators of sexual violence, for fear of reprisal or stigmatization;Whereas rape and other forms of gender-based violence in Haiti threaten the physical and psychological health of both the victims and their families;Whereas an effective, transparent, and impartial judicial system is key to the administration of justice, and the failure to ensure proper investigations and prosecutions undermines the ability to hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes and discourages victims from formally seeking justice;Whereas the Government of Haiti has undertaken efforts to prevent violence against women, as evidenced by its ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against Women, and other international human rights treaties, and the enactment of laws and the creation of state institutions to promote and protect the rights of women;Whereas the Ministry for the Status of Women and Women’s Rights in Haiti has been working on a comprehensive law that calls for the prevention, punishment, and elimination of violence against women;Whereas the Government of Haiti has been a signatory of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child since December 29, 1994;Whereas the Haitian National Police and the United Nations Mission for Stabilization of Haiti have created special police units to address sexual and other forms of gender-based violence in Haiti;Whereas the United Nations and donor countries, including the United States, continue to play a significant role in post-earthquake stabilization and reconstruction of Haiti;Whereas the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) has prioritized the prevention of, and response to, gender-based violence as a priority in its work across all sectors and as an explicit goal of the new USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy;Whereas [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] and the [[w:United States Department of State|United States Department of State]] have been directed by Executive order of the President to implement a new interagency United States Strategy To Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally;Whereas in March 2009, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued a report recognizing Haiti’s history of gender discrimination that fuels gender-based violence and gives rise to a climate of impunity; andWhereas in December 2010, the Inter-American Commission detailed steps the Government of Haiti must take to protect women and girls from increased risk of gender-based violence in post-earthquake Haiti: Now, therefore, be it
