=Sec. 3. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The implementation of new rules and regulations set forth in the Transformation Order has created financial uncertainty and instability for rural carriers by denying rural carriers a meaningful opportunity to recover investments and expenses incurred to provide universal service prior to 2012.
:(2) The implementation of the Transformation Order, including the utilization of a widely criticized regression analysis used to determine levels of universal service support, is creating significant uncertainty with respect to the sufficiency and predictability of the universal service support mechanisms, which has discouraged rural carriers from making broadband infrastructure investments to build out new broadband capabilities in high cost-to-serve rural communities throughout the United States.
:(3) The intent of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] under section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/254 47 U.S.C. 254] )is that the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] —
::(A) consult with the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service]] before adopting changes to regulations that affect universal service high-cost fund mechanisms; and
::(B) adopt policies and regulations that establish and maintain “specific, predictable, and sufficient” support mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.
:(4) The [[w:Rural Utilities Service|Secretary of Agriculture]] has warned that the implementation of the Transformation Order is having unintended consequences for rural broadband investment and deployment and for other Federal programs designed to promote rural broad­band deployment.
:(5) The [[w:Rural Utilities Service|Department of Agriculture]] has reported that demand for [[w:|Rural Utilities Service]] loans for broadband buildout has plummeted in 2013, due in part to the uncertainty created by the new rules and regulations set forth in the Transformation Order.
:(6) Surveys of rural carriers indicate that nearly two-thirds of rural rate-of-return carriers are canceling or postponing new broadband investments, while other reports indicate that rural rate-of-return carriers are being forced to increase consumer prices and reduce staff, creating ripple effects for economies in rural areas of the United States.
:(7) Congressional hearings have demonstrated that the approach of the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] to the consideration, review, and resolution of petitions for waivers from rules adopted under the Transformation Order—
::(A) is unduly burdensome and costly for small, rural carriers and inconsistent with the established policy and waiver standards of the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] ; and
::(B) is consequently discouraging small, rural carriers from requesting waivers and is creating additional business uncertainties.
:(8) Congressional hearings have demonstrated that the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] can make adjustments to the Transformation Order to address the adverse impact and business uncertainties confronting small, rural carriers without affecting other categories of carriers or increasing the Universal Service Fund budget established in the Transformation Order.
