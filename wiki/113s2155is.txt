{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to create a Federal Spectrum Reallocation Commission, to provide for the use of a portion of the proceeds from the auction of reallocated Federal spectrum for deficit reduction, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Maximizing Spectrum Efficiency and Value Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Demand for electromagnetic spectrum is sharply rising due to the growing advanced network of communications devices that rely on spectrum to transmit and receive information.
:(2) It is necessary for the United States to maintain its investments in innovation of spectrum and broadband infrastructure to ensure the United States is a global leader in the wireless age.
:(3) Spectrum is a finite resource, and in order to spur innovation, the United States must provide for better and more efficient spectrum management.
:(4) Many spectrum holders do not efficiently use their frequency assignments, and a restructuring of the usable spectrum is a viable solution to make up for this lost opportunity.
:(5) Making available additional spectrum to meet the demands of broadband technologies and services will prevent dropped connections, blocked service, decreased connection speed, and even higher prices for certain advanced applications.
:(6) The availability of increased spectrum will allow advanced technologies such as 4G mobile services, high-speed wireless, high definition television, and more to continue operating without network problems and interference.
:(7) The United States public debt totals not less than $14,300,000,000,000.
:(8) Congress should look for ways to increase Federal Government revenues without creating additional burdens on taxpayers.
:(9) Auctioning spectrum is the most economically sound method for accurate valuation and assignment of spectrum to develop the next generation of wireless technologies, expand broadband service to underserved areas of the country, develop an interoperable public safety network, and reduce the deficit.
:(10) Certain frequencies of spectrum have substantial market value and could raise significant new revenue in a public auction.
:(11) Barriers to a spectrum auction such as regulatory and administrative delays are not conducive to the free-market approach and can hurt innovation.
:(12) Federal Government spectrum, while extremely important, is vast and should be included in any spectrum reform initiative.
