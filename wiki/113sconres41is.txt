{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Denouncing the use of civilians as human shields by Hamas and other terrorist organizations in violation of international humanitarian law.    Whereas the term“human shields”refers to the use of civilians, prisoners of war, or other noncombatants whose mere presence is designed to protect combatants and objects from attack;   Whereas the use of human shields violates international humanitarian law (also referred to as the Law of War or Law of Armed Conflict);   Whereas Additional Protocol I, Article 50(1) to the Geneva Convention defines“civilian”as,“<nowiki>[a]ny person who does not belong to one of the categories of persons referred to in Article 4(A) (1), (2), (3), and (6) of the Third Convention and in Article 43 of this Protocol. In the case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person shall be considered a civilian.</nowiki>”;   Whereas Additional Protocol I, Article 51(7) to the Geneva Convention states,“<nowiki>[T]he presence or movement of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict shall not direct the movement of the civilian population or individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield military operations.</nowiki>”;   Whereas, since June 15, 2014, there have been over 2,000 rockets fired by Hamas and other terrorist organizations from Gaza into Israel;   Whereas Hamas uses civilian populations as human shields by placing its underground tunnel network and missile batteries in densely populated areas, and in and around schools, hospitals, and mosques;   Whereas Israel drops leaflets, makes announcements, places phone calls and sends text messages to the Palestinian people in Gaza warning them in advance that an attack is imminent, and goes to extraordinary lengths to target only terrorist actors;   Whereas Hamas has urged the residents of Gaza to ignore the Israeli warnings and to remain in their houses and has encouraged Palestinians to gather on the roofs of their homes to act as human shields; and   Whereas Hamas, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Al-Shabaab, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other foreign terrorist organizations typically use innocent civilians as human shields: Now, therefore, be it
