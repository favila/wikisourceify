 To direct the Secretary of the Interior to develop, maintain, and administer an annex in Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as an extension of the American Memorial Park located in Saipan, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. American Memorial Park Annex in Tinian=



==(a) Short title– ==

This section may be cited as the“ American Memorial Park Tinian Annex Act ”.

==(b) Findings– ==

Congress finds as follows:
:(1) In 2001 the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]conducted a suitability and feasibility study of North Field on the island of Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, for inclusion in the [[w:National Park Service|National Park System]].
:(2) North Field Tinian is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an historic district and has been designated a national historic landmark.
:(3) The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]holds a 50-year lease over North Field Tinian.
:(4) The [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]determined that North Field Tinian was suitable for inclusion as“one of the most significant World War II sites in the Pacific”because atomic bombs were flown to Hiroshima and Nagasaki from this site.
:(5) The [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]determined, however, that it was not feasible to include North Field Tinian as a unit of the [[w:National Park Service|National Park System]]because of the“military’s future long term needs”.
:(6) American Memorial Park on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, is managed by the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]], as authorized under[[Public Law 94-241|Public Law 94–241]] and[[Public Law 95-348|Public Law 95–348]] , to commemorate the World War II Marianas Campaign.
:(7) A Tinian Annex to the American Memorial Park could provide the opportunity for on and off site interpretation of North Field without conflicting with military needs.

==(c) Establishment– ==

Using existing facilities instead of developing new facilities to the extent practicable, the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], acting through the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]], shall develop, maintain, and administer an annex in Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as an extension of the American Memorial Park located in Saipan, on an appropriate parcel of Tinian Public Land to be agreed upon by the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]and the Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands in consultation with the Mayor of Tinian. The annex shall be used to—
:(1) interpret the important aspects of North Field by highlighting the historic events related to the World War II Marianas Campaign; and
:(2) serve as a curatorial storage of World War II artifacts.
