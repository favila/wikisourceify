=={{anchor|H5CEC393BB1374070AC8A71F747D50AC7}}(a) Short Title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“Restoring Confidence Through Smarter Campaigns Act”.

=={{anchor|H827B95F295BA43B386C5F02A56098BA2}}(b) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Supreme Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo failed to recognize that unlimited spending on elections has a corrosive effect on the electoral process and on public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.
:(2) Restoring Congress’s regulatory power over campaign expenditures will level the playing field by creating a realistic opportunity for more Americans to seek Federal office and by encouraging elections that are more competitive.
:(3) Limiting the need for incessant fundraising by Members of Congress may restore the public’s confidence in both the electoral process and in the accountability of Members to the constituents who elect them.
