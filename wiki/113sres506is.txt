{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the patriotism and contributions of auxiliaries of veterans service organizations.    Whereas, for nearly a century, auxiliaries have served as a complementary and integral part of veterans service organizations, supporting members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families;   Whereas, since their inception, auxiliary units have proudly supported members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and the families of those who have served, volunteering hundreds of thousands of hours and raising billions of dollars;   Whereas auxiliaries have representatives in all 50 States and abroad;   Whereas auxiliaries have more than 1,000,000 members and are composed of wives, widows, mothers, grandmothers, daughters, and granddaughters of veterans, as well as veterans themselves;   Whereas auxiliary units have raised money to aid and enhance the lives of members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families through financial support—providing assistance with essentials such as rent, child care, utilities, and food;   Whereas auxiliary units host“stand-downs”that focus on providing vital health and support services to homeless veterans;   Whereas auxiliary units strengthen their local communities by conducting food drives, visiting hospitals, and providing scholarships to youth;   Whereas auxiliary units serve as advocates for veterans and their families;   Whereas auxiliary units conduct welcome home and send-off events for members of the Armed Forces;   Whereas members of auxiliaries selflessly volunteer their services at facilities of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]throughout the country to enhance the lives of veterans and their families; and   Whereas, each year, auxiliary units raise millions of dollars for cancer research: Now, therefore, be it
