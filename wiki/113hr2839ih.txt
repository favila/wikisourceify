This Act may be cited as the “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” .

=Sec. 2. Review of discharge characterization=



==(a) In general– ==

In accordance with this section, the appropriate discharge boards—

:(2) if such characterization is any characterization except honorable, may change such characterization to honorable.

==(b) Criteria– ==

In changing the discharge characterization of a covered member to honorable under subsection (a)(2), the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] shall ensure that such changes are carried out consistently and uniformly across the military departments using the following criteria:
:(1) The original discharge must be based on Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (in this Act referred to as DADT ) or a similar policy in place prior to the enactment of DADT.
:(2) Such discharge characterization shall be so changed if, with respect to the original discharge, there were no aggravating circumstances, such as misconduct, that would have independently led to a discharge characterization that was any characterization except honorable. For purposes of this paragraph, such aggravating circumstances may not include—
::(A) an offense under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/925 section 925of title 10, United States Code] (article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), committed by a covered member against a person of the same sex with the consent of such person; or
::(B) statements, consensual sexual conduct, or consensual acts relating to sexual orientation or identity, or the disclosure of such statements, conduct, or acts, that were prohibited at the time of discharge but after the date of such discharge became permitted.

:::(ii) a personal affidavit of the circumstances surrounding the discharge; and
:::(iii) any relevant records pertaining to the discharge; or

::(A) the appropriate discharge board shall make every effort to locate the documents specified in subparagraph (A)of such paragraph within the records of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] ; and

Any other similar indication of the sexual orientation or reason for discharge shall be removed or changed accordingly to be consistent with this paragraph.
:(2) For each covered member whose discharge occurred prior to the creation of general secretarial authority, the sections of the DD–214 form referred to paragraph (1)shall be changed to similarly reflect a universal authority with codes, authorities, and language applicable at the time of discharge.
