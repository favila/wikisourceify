In changing the discharge characterization of a covered member to honorable under subsection (a)(2), the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] shall ensure that such changes are carried out consistently and uniformly across the military departments using the following criteria:
:(1) The original discharge must be based on Don’t Ask Don’t Tell (in this Act referred to as DADT ) or a similar policy in place prior to the enactment of DADT.
:(2) Such discharge characterization shall be so changed if, with respect to the original discharge, there were no aggravating circumstances, such as misconduct, that would have independently led to a discharge characterization that was any characterization except honorable. For purposes of this paragraph, such aggravating circumstances may not include—
::(A) an offense under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/925 section 925of title 10, United States Code] (article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), committed by a covered member against a person of the same sex with the consent of such person; or

:(2) For each covered member whose discharge occurred prior to the creation of general secretarial authority, the sections of the DD–214 form referred to paragraph (1)shall be changed to similarly reflect a universal authority with codes, authorities, and language applicable at the time of discharge.
