{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of Congress that President Barack Obama has violated section 3 of article II of the Constitution by refusing to enforce the employer mandate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.Whereas section 1 of article I of the Constitution states that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] of the United States, which shall consist of a [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] and [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] ” ;Whereas section 3 of article II of the Constitution states that the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]  “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” , which imposes a duty upon the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] to enforce the law, regardless of difficulty of enforcement or displeasure with the statute;Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Actwas signed into law by President
[[w:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]] on March 23, 2010;Whereas such Act contains a provision commonly referred to as the employer mandate , which requires businesses that employ 50 or more full-time employees to provide health insurance to its employees upon threat of financial penalty;Whereas section 1513(d) of such Actstates that the employer mandate “shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013” ;Whereas the executive branch announced on July 2, 2013, that it would unilaterally delay the enforcement of the employer mandate until January 2015;Whereas the principle of separation of powers is a constitutional safeguard of liberty as asserted by James Madison in Federalist No. 47 in which he stated, “The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands … may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny” ; andWhereas the executive branch’s unilateral decision to delay the implementation of a law sets a dangerous precedent under which legislation that is enacted through the passage of that legislation by the democratically elected Members of Congress and the signing of that legislation into law by the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] will no longer have the force of law and will instead be relegated to having the status of a mere recommendation, which the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] may choose to ignore: Now, therefore, be it
