[[w:Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mr. Thompson of California]] (for himself and

{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the permanent application of the new markets tax credit for the redevelopment of communities impacted by realignment or closure of military installations.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ New Markets Tax Credit Military Installation Act of 2013 ”or the“ NMTC Military Installation Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Since 1988, through 5 separate rounds of the Base Realignment and Closure process, more than 300 military installations located in 48 States and 3 United States territories have had their missions eliminated or realigned.
:(2) 120 of these former installations were major base closures, resulting in the loss of 300 or more military and civilian jobs at each closure. While these communities received Federal support in the 1990s, there are currently no Federal programs to support the physical redevelopment at closed or realigned installations.
:(3) Despite local active efforts to promote redevelopment, nearly 100 of these closed or realigned military installations are located in economically distressed communities now suffering from high unemployment and disproportionately high poverty rates as determined by the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] .
:(4) More than 20 of these former installations are located in even harder hit severely distressed communities as defined by the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] .
:(5) One example is the City of Vallejo, California, which in 2008 filed for bankruptcy protection due in part to closure of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard and the accompanying loss of almost 10,000 jobs.
:(6) When a military base is closed, the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] is required to complete any necessary environmental cleanup at the former base and then transition the property to a Local Redevelopment Authority, usually a local government. Together, the [[w:Office of Economic Adjustment|Department of Defense Office of Economic Adjustment]] and the Local Redevelopment Authority create a redevelopment plan for the property. The goal of this process is to lead to a timely, beneficial, revenue generating reuse of these former military bases.
:(7) However, numerous former military installations have taken much longer and cost much more than expected to clean up, thereby significantly delaying reuse and causing many of these communities to become or remain economically distressed.
:(8) In 2000, the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program was created to spur private sector investment in low-income communities suffering from chronic unemployment and high poverty rates by providing investors with a 7-year, 39-percent Federal income tax credit for investments made through investment vehicles known as Community Development Entities. According to the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] , every $1 of foregone tax revenues under the NMTC program leverages about $12 of private investment in distressed communities on a cost basis.
:(9) Recently, the community in Brunswick, Maine, has been successfully redeveloping the former Naval Air Station located there, by using among other tools the NMTC. In particular, the NMTC was used to build a new, $15 million, 80,000 square foot manufacturing facility operated by Swedish medical supply maker Molnlycke Health Care. A second NMTC was used to make $20 million in renovations of facilities now operated by aircraft manufacturer Kestrel Aeroworks. This latter project could have been 3 times as large had additional NMTC funds been available. These two projects alone will bring over 200 high-tech, high-wage jobs among other significant economic benefits to this economically distressed former military community.
:(10) Communities surrounding these former military installations still face the difficult challenges of economic redevelopment resulting from the loss of the Federal workforce and the supporting infrastructure associated with the former military missions located there. Focusing part of the successful NMTC to help these communities that are still struggling after the military exodus will help facilitate the economic redevelopment that these distressed communities need.
