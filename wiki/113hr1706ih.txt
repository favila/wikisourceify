{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish an Independent Monitor to maintain oversight of the settlement by mortgage servicing companies that were subject to enforcement actions for unsafe and unsound practices related to residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Mortgage Settlement Monitoring Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) In April 2011, the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the then-Office of Thrift Supervision issued a joint report titled “Interagency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices” summarizing the results of “horizontal reviews” of the Nation’s 14 largest mortgage servicers finding “critical weaknesses in servicers’ foreclosures governance practices, foreclosure document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party vendors, including foreclosure attorneys,” resulting in “unsafe and unsound practices and violations of applicable Federal and State law requirements” .
:(2) As part of federal enforcement actions addressing these unsafe and unsound practices related to residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing, fourteen mortgage servicing companies entered into consent orders with the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] and the [[w:Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] beginning on April 13, 2011.
:(3) The consent orders required these mortgage servicers to undertake an “Independent Foreclosure Review” in order to ascertain individual harms and provide appropriate monetary relief to homeowners as a result of these business practice failures. Mortgage servicers contracted with third-party consultants approved by the federal agencies to conduct these reviews.
:(4) During the tenure of the Independent Foreclosure Review process, questions persisted concerning the nature and adequacy of the reviews and expected remediation as well as the independence of the third-party reviewers.
:(5) On February 28, 2013, the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] and the [[w:Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] finalized amendments to the April 2011 consent orders with 11 of the 14 mortgage servicers. Under the terms of these orders, mortgage servicers are to provide cash payments and other assistance to borrowers—including more than $3,000,000,000 in direct cash payments to borrowers who had homes in foreclosure in 2009 or 2010—and the Independent Foreclosure Review process will cease for the mortgage servicers who agreed to enter into the amended consent orders.
:(6) On April 4, 2013, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) issued a report titled “Foreclosure Review: Lessons Learned Could Enhance Continuing Reviews and Activities Under Amended Consent Orders” which examined the Independent Foreclosure Review process. It found that the “<nowiki>[c]omplexity of the reviews, overly broad guidance, and limited monitoring for consistency impeded the ability of the</nowiki> [[w:Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) and the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] (Federal Reserve) to achieve the goals of the foreclosure review” . The report also stated that “limited communication with borrowers and the public adversely impacted transparency and public confidence,” and the [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] recommended that the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] and the [[w:Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]]  “identify and apply lessons from the foreclosure review process, such as enhancing planning, and monitoring activities to achieve goals, as they develop and implement the activities under the amended consent orders” .
:(7) In light of the significant harm caused by mortgage servicers’ unsafe and unsound business practices, and the lack of transparency surrounding the Independent Foreclosure Review process and the amended consent orders that replace this process, it is essential that thorough oversight be conducted over these new orders to ensure that all terms are fully enforced. Creation of an Office of the Independent Monitor, which will provide reports directly to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , will aid in meeting this objective.

=Sec. 3. Settlement defined=

For purposes of this Act, the term “settlement” means—
:(1) the amended consent orders finalized on February 28, 2013, between the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] and the [[w:Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and 11 mortgage servicing companies that were subject to enforcement actions for unsafe and unsound practices related to residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing; and
:(2) any future agreement between the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]] and the [[w:Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and a mortgage servicing company, the terms of which are similar to the agreement described in paragraph (1).
