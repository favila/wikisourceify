{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing support for the designation of the fourth week in April as “Every Kid Healthy Week” .Whereas childhood obesity, undernourishment, and physical inactivity are national epidemics, and schools can help to address these problems by becoming healthier places so kids can live healthier lives;Whereas 1 in 3 of the Nation’s children are overweight or obese which puts those children at a high risk for developing heart disease, cancer, asthma, and diabetes;Whereas only 8 percent of elementary school students and 6 percent of middle and high school students have daily physical education;Whereas every child needs a healthy diet consisting of nutritious foods in appropriate portion sizes based on age and development;Whereas children who eat poorly or who engage in too little physical activity do not perform as well as they should academically;Whereas the primary goal of “Every Kid Healthy Week” is for schools to host events that will engage volunteers to improve school health environments by making sustainable changes that encourage students to eat better and be active every day;Whereas “Every Kid Healthy Week” will act as a focal point for year-round programing related to the Nation’s childhood obesity epidemic as well as its solutions, including sound nutrition, regular physical activity, and health-promoting school programs; andWhereas the fourth week in April would be an appropriate week to designate as “Every Kid Healthy Week” to bring national attention to the importance of keeping kids fit and healthy, and to provide an opportunity to emphasize the significance of making the choices necessary to sustain a healthy and physically active lifestyle: Now, therefore, be it
