<blockquote>

==(7) Employment eligibility verification system==


===(A) In general===

The [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security ]]shall establish and administer a verification system through which the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]](or a designee of the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]])—: responds to inquiries made by persons at any time through a toll-free telephone line and other toll-free electronic media concerning an individual’s identity and whether the individual is authorized to be employed; and: maintains records of the inquiries that were made, of verifications provided (or not provided), and of the codes provided to inquirers as evidence of their compliance with their obligations under this section.
===(B) Design and operation of system===

The verification system shall be designed and operated—: to maximize its reliability and ease of use by persons and other entities consistent with insulating and protecting the privacy and security of the underlying information;: to respond to all inquiries made by such persons and entities on whether individuals are authorized to be employed and to register all times when such inquiries are not received;: with appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal information; and: to have reasonable safeguards against the system’s resulting in unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status, including—:: the selective or unauthorized use of the system to verify eligibility;:: the use of the system prior to an offer of employment; or:: the exclusion of certain individuals from consideration for employment as a result of a perceived likelihood that additional verification will be required, beyond what is required for most job applicants.
===(C) Responsibilities of the Commissioner of Social Security===

As part of the verification system, the [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Commissioner of Social Security ]], in consultation with the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security ]](and any designee of the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]selected to establish and administer the verification system), shall establish a reliable, secure method, which, within the time periods specified under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3) , compares the name and Social Security account number provided in an inquiry against such information maintained by the [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Commissioner ]]in order to validate (or not validate) the information provided regarding an individual whose identity and employment eligibility must be confirmed, the correspondence of the name and number, and whether the individual has presented a Social Security account number that is not valid for employment. The [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Commissioner ]]shall not disclose or release Social Security information (other than such verification or nonverification) except as provided for in this section or section 205(c)(2)(I) of the Social Security Act .
===(D) Responsibilities of the Secretary of Homeland Security===

: As part of the verification system, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security ]](in consultation with any designee of the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]selected to establish and administer the verification system), shall establish a reliable, secure method, which, within the time periods specified under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3) , compares the name and alien identification or authorization number which are provided in an inquiry against such information maintained by the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]in order to validate (or not validate) the information provided, the correspondence of the name and number, and whether the alien is authorized to be employed in the United States.: When a single employer has submitted to the verification system pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3) the identical Social Security account number in more than one instance, or when multiple employers have submitted to the verification system pursuant to such paragraph the identical Social Security account number, in a manner which indicates the possible fraudulent use of that number, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security ]]shall conduct an investigation, within the time periods specified in such subparagraphs, in order to ensure that no fraudulent use of a Social Security account number has taken place. If the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]has selected a designee to establish and administer the verification system, the designee shall notify the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]when a single employer has submitted to the verification system pursuant to such subparagraphs the identical Social Security account number in more than one instance, or when multiple employers have submitted to the verification system pursuant to such paragraph the identical Social Security account number, in a manner which indicates the possible fraudulent use of that number. The designee shall also provide the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]with all pertinent information, including the name and address of the employer or employers who submitted the relevant Social Security account number, the relevant Social Security account number submitted by the employer or employers, and the relevant name and date of birth of the employee submitted by the employer or employers.: The [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]in consultation with the [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Commissioner of Social Security ]], shall establish procedures to permit an individual who contests a tentative or final nonverification notice, or seeks to verify the individual’s own employment, to contact the appropriate agency and, in a timely manner, correct or update the information used by the system.: The [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary ]]shall prescribe a system to register employer participation prior to the date the employer is required or permitted to submit information with respect to an employee.
===(E) Updating information===

The [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Commissioner of Social Security ]]and the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security ]]shall update their information in a manner that promotes the maximum accuracy and shall provide a process for the prompt correction of erroneous information, including instances in which it is brought to their attention in the secondary verification process described in paragraph (3)(C) .
===(F) Federal Tort Claims Act===

If an individual alleges that the individual would not have been dismissed from a job but for an error of the verification mechanism, the individual may seek compensation only through the mechanism of the Federal Tort Claims Act, and injunctive relief to correct such error. No class action may be brought under this subparagraph.
===(G) Protection from liability for actions taken on the basis of information===

No person or entity shall be civilly or criminally liable for any action taken in good faith reliance on information provided through the employment eligibility verification mechanism established under this paragraph..

If an individual provides a document (or combination of documents) that reasonably appears on its face to be genuine, reasonably appears to pertain to the individual whose identity and work eligibility is being verified, and is sufficient to meet the first sentence of this paragraph, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the person or entity to solicit the production of any other document or as requiring the individual to produce another document.;
