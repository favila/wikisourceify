{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for the designation of September 2013 as National Sepsis and Septic Shock Awareness Month .    Whereas sepsis is a medical condition that occurs due to an immune response to infection;   Whereas the released immune chemicals into the blood to fight infection can cause impaired blood flow, which injures the bodyâ€™s organs;   Whereas in severe cases blood pressure drops, the heart weakens, and septic shock can occur, exposing the patient to multiple organ failure which can lead to death;   Whereas sepsis is a serious medical condition and a leading cause of death;   Whereas about 750,000 people in the United States are infected by sepsis annually;   Whereas the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health]] has estimated that between 28 and 50 percent of people infected die, attributing to more United States deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined;   Whereas it is estimated that approximately $17,000,000,000 annually is spent combating sepsis in the United States;   Whereas the number of sepsis related deaths is currently on the rise in the United States;   Whereas many symptoms of sepsis mimic other conditions, making sepsis difficult to diagnose; and   Whereas September 2013 would be an appropriate month to designate as National Sepsis and Septic Shock Awareness Month to raise awareness and encourage the education of patients, families, and health care professionals on the seriousness of early detection as the key to survival: Now, therefore, be it
