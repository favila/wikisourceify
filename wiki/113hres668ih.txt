 Supporting the goals and ideals of the Community Development Block Grant program.    Whereas the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is a Federal program administered by the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]]and provides direct grants to States and local governments for the purposes of economic and community development;   Whereas the CDBG program was established under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 ;   Whereas this grant program was signed into law by President Gerald R. Ford on August 22, 1974, and is among the longest running grant programs in our Nation’s history;   Whereas this grant program assists more than 1,200 State and local governments each year;   Whereas this grant program allows grantees flexibility in tackling unique and complex challenges facing their communities;   Whereas the CDBG program has invested over $145 billion in urban, suburban, and rural economies since its inception;   Whereas CDBG funding is used to leverage other funds from the private sector, non-profit organizations, and State and local governments;   Whereas every CDBG dollar invested in communities leverages, on average, $4.07 in other funds;   Whereas between fiscal years 2005 and 2013 this program has created or retained approximately 330,500 jobs;   Whereas the CDBG program has funded public improvements benefitting States and local communities;   Whereas between fiscal years 2005 and 2013, the CDBG program provided public services to over 100 million people and assisted more than 1 million households;   Whereas the CDBG program has been used to assist communities in the aftermath of natural disasters and in the midst of economic crises; and   Whereas the CDBG program provides the largest amount of Federal assistance to State and local governments for development efforts: Now, therefore, be it
