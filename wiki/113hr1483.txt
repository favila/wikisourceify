===(4) Retention and payment of consultant– ===

The independent consultant is hired, and paid, directly by the appropriate Federal banking agency and the appropriate Federal banking agency is to be reimbursed for such expenses by the entity subject to the consent order.

===(5) Restriction on application of penalties to other ongoing enforcement actions– ===

Any remediation or penalties under the consent order will not apply to, or be settled in conjunction with, any other consent order, settlement, or enforcement action.

==(b) Private right of action– ==

If an independent consultant fails to comply with the contract under which the consultant is assisting the appropriate Federal banking agency in carrying out a consent order which requires financial remediation to a person or class of persons, any person or class of persons aggrieved by such failure may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction for damages resulting from such violation, and may obtain other appropriate relief, including equitable relief.

If a court determines that an independent consultant has violated the terms of the contract with the appropriate Federal banking agency or has failed to disclose required conflict of interest information, the independent consultant shall repay the appropriate Federal banking agency all fees received by the consultant during the period of time such violation or failure was occurring.

===(2) Safe harbor– ===

If the independent consultant made all reasonable efforts to uncover conflicts of interest among the consultant’s agents and employees, the consultant shall not be subject to paragraph (1)with respect to a failure to disclose required conflict of interest information.

==(d) Employment restriction– ==

An employee of an appropriate Federal banking agency that was involved in approving an independent consultant to assist in carrying out a consent order may not seek employment with, or be employed by, such independent consultant during any period in which such consent order is in effect, any amendment to such consent order is in effect, or any subsequent consent order based on the original consent order is in effect..
