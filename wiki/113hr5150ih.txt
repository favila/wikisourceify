=Sec. 2. Water efficiency, conservation, and adaptation=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) 
::(A) human-induced climate change is affecting the natural water cycle, decreasing precipitation levels in the West, especially the Southwest, and making droughts and floods more frequent and more intense;
::(B) declining precipitation levels will severely impact water supplies in Southwestern States; and
::(C) a sharp increase in the number of days with very heavy precipitation throughout the Northeast and the Midwest will stress aging water infrastructure;
:(2) changes in the water cycle caused by climate disruptions will adversely affect water infrastructure, energy production and use, human health, transportation, agriculture, and ecosystems, while also aggravating water disputes across the United States;
:(3) 
::(A) the Colorado River, which supplies water for more than 30,000,000 people, is experiencing the worst drought in more than 100 years of recordkeeping; and
::(B) the primary reservoirs of the Colorado River Basin and Lakes Mead and Powell have lost nearly half of the storage waters of the reservoirs and lakes, and clean hydropower generated from Hoover Dam risks reduction if the extended drought persists;
:(4) States and local governments and water utilities can begin to address the challenges described in this subsection by providing incentives for water efficiency and conservation, while also planning and investing in infrastructure to adapt to the impacts of climate change, particularly those impacts already affecting the United States;
:(5) residential water demand can be reduced by 25 to 40 percent using existing, cost-effective technologies that also can reduce the water bills of consumers by hundreds of dollars per year; and
:(6) water and energy use are inseparable activities, and supplying and treating water consumes around 4 percent of the electricity of the United States, and electricity makes up 75 percent of the cost of processing and delivering municipal water.

==(b) Definition of Administrator– ==

In this Act, the term Administrator means the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]].

==(c) WaterSense– ==



===(1) In general– ===

There is established within the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]a WaterSense program to identify and promote water efficient products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services so as—
:(A) to reduce water use;
:(B) to reduce the strain on water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure;
:(C) to conserve energy used to pump, heat, transport, and treat water; and
:(D) to preserve water resources for future generations, through voluntary labeling of, or other forms of communications about, products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services that meet the highest water efficiency and performance criteria.

===(2) Duties– ===

The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall—
:(A) establish—
::(i) a WaterSense label to be used for certain items; and
::(ii) the procedure by which an item may be certified to display the WaterSense label;
:(B) promote WaterSense-labeled products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services in the market place as the preferred technologies and services for—
::(i) reducing water use; and
::(ii) ensuring product and service performance;
:(C) work to enhance public awareness of the WaterSense label through public outreach, education, and other means;
:(D) preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label by—
::(i) establishing and maintaining performance criteria so that products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services labeled with the WaterSense label perform as well or better than less water-efficient counterparts;
::(ii) overseeing WaterSense certifications made by third parties;
::(iii) conducting reviews of the use of the WaterSense label in the marketplace and taking corrective action in any case in which misuse of the label is identified; and
::(iv) carrying out such other measures as the Administrator determines to be appropriate;
:(E) regularly review and, if appropriate, update WaterSense criteria for categories of products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services, at least once every 4 years;
:(F) to the maximum extent practicable, regularly estimate and make available to the public the production and relative market shares of, and the savings of water, energy, and capital costs of water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure attributable to the use of WaterSense-labeled products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services, at least annually;
:(G) solicit comments from interested parties and the public prior to establishing or revising a WaterSense category, specification, installation criterion, or other criterion (or prior to effective dates for any such category, specification, installation criterion, or other criterion);
:(H) provide reasonable notice to interested parties and the public of any changes (including effective dates), on the adoption of a new or revised category, specification, installation criterion, or other criterion, along with—
::(i) an explanation of the changes; and
::(ii) as appropriate, responses to comments submitted by interested parties and the public;
:(I) provide appropriate lead time (as determined by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]) prior to the applicable effective date for a new or significant revision to a category, specification, installation criterion, or other criterion, taking into account the timing requirements of the manufacturing, marketing, training, and distribution process for the specific product, building and landscape, or service category addressed;
:(J) identify and, if appropriate, implement other voluntary approaches in commercial, institutional, residential, industrial, and municipal sectors to encourage recycling and reuse technologies to improve water efficiency or lower water use; and
:(K) if appropriate, apply the WaterSense label to water-using products that are labeled by the Energy Star program implemented by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]and the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]].
