shitburger[[w:|Mr. Udall of New Mexico]] (for himself and
shitburger[[w:|Mr. Heinrich]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Public Health Service Act to expand and intensify programs of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with respect to translational research and related activities concerning cavernous angioma, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Cavernous Angioma Research Resource Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress makes the following findings:
:(1) Cavernous angioma, also termed cerebral cavernous malformations or CCM , affects an estimated 1,500,000 people in the United States.
:(2) Cavernous angioma is a devastating blood vessel disease that is characterized by the presence of vascular lesions that develop and grow within the brain and spinal cord.
:(3) Detection of cavernous angioma lesions is achieved through costly and specialized medical imaging techniques. These techniques are often not readily available where patients live, and require sedation for children and disabled adults.
:(4) Cavernous angioma is a common type of vascular anomaly, but individuals may not be aware that they have the disease until the onset of serious clinical symptoms. In the genetic forms, they may not be aware that it may be passed on to their children.
:(5) Individuals diagnosed with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sudden death.
:(6) Due to limited research with respect to cavernous angioma, there is no treatment regimen for the disease other than brain and spinal surgery.
:(7) Some individuals with cavernous angioma are not candidates for brain surgery. No alternative treatment option is available for such individuals.
:(8) There is a shortage of physicians who are familiar with cavernous angioma and affected individuals may find it difficult to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate care.
:(9) Due to the presence of a specific disease-causing mutation, termed the common Hispanic mutation that has passed through as many as 17 generations of Americans descended from the original Spanish settlers of the Southwest in the 1590s, New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world. Cavernous angioma affects thousands of individuals in New Mexico and with ancestry in New Mexico.
:(10) Other States with high rates of cavernous angioma due to the common Hispanic Mutation include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado.
:(11) To address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and throughout the United States, there is a need to identify institutions capable of running clinical trial for this debilitating brain disorder.

=Sec. 3. Cavernous angioma research activities=

 Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/284 42 U.S.C. 284 et seq.] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

Such coordinating center shall—
:(i) have an institutional infrastructure that is capable of hosting a clinical trial site and facilitating translational projects and collaborations for clinical trials;
:(ii) have the capacity to maintain programs dedicated to patient education, patient outreach, and awareness, including—
::(I) launching a national multimedia public awareness campaign;
::(II) creating and distributing patient education materials for distribution by national physician and surgeon offices;
::(III) establishing an education program for elementary and secondary school nurses to facilitate early detection and diagnosis of cavernous angioma in areas of high cavernous angioma population density;
::(IV) coordinating regular patient and family-oriented educational conferences; and
::(V) developing nationally relevant electronic health teaching and communication tools and a network of professional capacity and patient and family support;
:(iii) have the capacity to establish and maintain communication with other major cavernous angioma research and care institutions internationally for information sharing and coordination of research activities;
:(iv) have demonstrated clinical expertise in cavernous angioma management;
:(v) have a sufficient number of eligible patients for participation with particular focus on unique subpopulations including Common Hispanic Mutation and CCM3 gene mutation carriers; and
:(vi) have a telehealth infrastructure to support and to provide clinical consultation for remote and underserved communities.

====(B) Participation– ====

Identify and support the development of clinical and research participation centers with the potential to participate in a multi-site clinical drug trial for cavernous angioma. Such participation centers may facilitate medical research to develop a cure for cavernous angioma and enhance the medical care of individuals with cavernous angioma in partnership with the coordinating center under subparagraph (A)and other national and international centers. Such participation centers shall—
:(i) have an institutional infrastructure capable of hosting a clinical trial site and facilitating translational projects and collaborations for clinical trials;
:(ii) have the capacity to maintain communication with other major cavernous angioma research and care institutions internationally for information sharing and coordination of research activities;
:(iii) have demonstrated clinical expertise in cavernous angioma management; and
:(iv) have a sufficient numbers of eligible patients for participation with particular focus on unique subpopulations including Common Hispanic Mutation and CCM3 gene mutation carriers as these unique populations may provide insight to other genetic and non-genetic forms of the illness.

==(c) Training program for clinicians and scientists– ==
