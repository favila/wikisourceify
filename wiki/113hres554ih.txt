{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the alarming mortality rate of African-American women with breast cancer.    Whereas serious disparities persist in United States health care today;   Whereas life-saving progress has been made in breast cancer treatment over the last two decades, but we have not seen the same progress in the treatment of African-American breast cancer patients;   Whereas African-American women have a 41 percent higher breast cancer mortality rate than white women in the United States;   Whereas this disparity results in 1,700 additional deaths each year;   Whereas in Los Angeles, a black breast cancer patient is about 70 percent more likely to die from the disease than a white breast cancer patient is likely to die from the disease;   Whereas African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with later stage breast cancer; and   Whereas African-American women are less likely to be screened for breast cancer and less likely to receive the medical treatment they need to fight breast cancer: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]â€”
:(1) recognizes the disparity in treatment rates of African-American breast cancer patients;
