Such estimate shall be predicated upon the supplemental projection described in section 202(e)(4). The [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]] shall submit to such committee the macroeconomic impact analysis, together with the basis for the analysis. As a supplement to estimates prepared under section 402, all such information so submitted shall be included in the report accompanying such bill or resolution.

===(b) Economic impact– ===

The analysis prepared under subsection (a)shall describe the potential economic impact of the applicable major bill or resolution on major economic variables, including real gross domestic product, business investment, the capital stock, employment, interest rates, and labor supply. The analysis shall also describe the potential fiscal effects of the bill or resolution, including any estimates of revenue increases or decreases resulting from changes in gross domestic product. To the extent practicable, the analysis should use a variety of economic models in order to reflect the full range of possible economic outcomes resulting from the bill or resolution. The analysis (or a technical appendix to the analysis) shall specify the economic and econometric models used, sources of data, relevant data transformations, and shall include such explanation as is necessary to make the models comprehensible to academic and public policy analysts.

===(c) Definitions– ===

As used in this section—
:(1) the term macroeconomic impact analysis means—
::(A) an estimate of the changes in economic output, employment, interest rates, capital stock, and tax revenues expected to result from enactment of the proposal;
::(B) an estimate of revenue feedback expected to result from enactment of the proposal; and
::(C) a statement identifying the critical assumptions and the source of data underlying that estimate;
:(2) the term major bill or resolution means any bill or resolution if the gross budgetary effects of such bill or resolution for any fiscal year in the period for which an estimate is prepared under section 402is estimated to be greater than .25 percent of the current projected gross domestic product of the United States for any such fiscal year;
:(3) the term “budgetary effect” , when applied to a major bill or resolution, means the changes in revenues, outlays, deficits, and debt resulting from that measure; and
:(4) the term revenue feedback means changes in revenue resulting from changes in economic growth as the result of the enactment of any major bill or resolution..
