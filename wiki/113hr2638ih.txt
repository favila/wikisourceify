:(B) Disseminating guidelines for the development and implementation of monitoring and evaluation programs to all personnel, especially in the field, who are responsible for the design, implementation, and management of United States foreign assistance programs.
:(C) Developing a clearinghouse capacity for the collection and dissemination of knowledge and lessons learned that serve as benchmarks to guide future programs for United States development professionals, implementing partners, the international aid community, and aid recipient governments, and as a repository of knowledge on lessons learned.

In addition, providing a summary of each evaluation, including a description of the evaluation methodology, and key findings and recommendations made in the evaluation, to the public online in a fully searchable form, within 90 days after the completion of the evaluation.

:(G) Partnering with the academic community, implementing partners, and national and international institutions that have expertise in monitoring and evaluation and analysis when such partnerships will provide needed expertise or will significantly improve the evaluation and analysis.
:(H) Developing and implementing a training plan for appropriate aid personnel on the proper conduct of monitoring and evaluation programs.
:(I) Providing relevant and useful evaluation questions that meet the needs of decision makers, an appropriate and feasible design for the evaluation questions, and criteria that permit objective assessment and valid conclusions on the evaluation questions.
:(J) Ensuring sufficient, credible, and reliable measures and data in the evaluation of the effectiveness of foreign assistance programs, including an assessment of assumptions and limitations made in such evaluation.
