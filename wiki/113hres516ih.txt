{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for the designation of Journeymen Linemen Recognition Day.    Whereas journeymen linemen provide a vital service on a daily basis;   Whereas journeymen linemen put their lives on the line every day to assure safe and reliable power for the American people;   Whereas journeymen linemen work at heights and in close proximity to energized electric lines, and in emergencies they often work extremely long hours under sometimes dangerous conditions to restore power;   Whereas Henry Miller, the first elected president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was killed on July 10, 1896, at just 38 years old;   Whereas Henry Miller died of injuries sustained while troubleshooting an electrical outage; and   Whereas there should be a day to honor those industry first responders who have given their lives in the line of duty along with those who provide skillful service in times of local or national crisis: Now, therefore, be it    

= =
