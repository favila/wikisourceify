{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Honoring military children during the National Month of the Military Child.    Whereas more than 2,200,000 individuals demonstrate courage and commitment to freedom by serving in the Armed Forces of the United States;   Whereas 43.5 percent of members of the Armed Forces, when deployed away from their permanent duty stations, leave behind families with children;   Whereas no one feels the effect of deployments more than the children of deployed members of the Armed Forces;   Whereas as of March 2014, more than 52,000 children have had a military parent wounded in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom;   Whereas the daily struggles and personal sacrifices of children of members of the Armed Forces are too often unnoticed;   Whereas countless children live with a parent who is a member of the Armed Forces and who bears a visible or invisible wound of war;   Whereas the children of members of the Armed Forces are a source of pride and honor to the people of the United States, and it is fitting that the United States recognize the contributions of such children and celebrate the spirit of such children;   Whereas the National Month of the Military Child, observed in April of each year, recognizes military children for their sacrifices and contributes to demonstrating the unconditional support of the United States for members of the Armed Forces;   Whereas in addition to programs of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]to support military families and military children, various programs and campaigns have been established in the private sector to honor, support, and thank military children by fostering awareness and appreciation for the sacrifices and the challenges that such children face; and   Whereas a month-long salute to military children encourages support for the organizations and campaigns established to provide direct support for military children and families: Now, therefore, be it

:(1) joins the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]in honoring the children of members of the Armed Forces and recognizes that such children share in the burden of protecting the United States; and
:(2) urges the people of the United States to join the military community in observing the National Month of the Military Child with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor, support, and thank military children.
