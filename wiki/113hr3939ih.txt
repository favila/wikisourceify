==Title I— American Infrastructure Financing Authority==



==Sec. 101. Findings and purpose==



===(a) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) infrastructure has always been a vital element of the economic strength of the United States and a key indicator of the international leadership of the United States;
:(2) the Erie Canal, the Hoover Dam, the railroads, and the interstate highway system are all testaments to American ingenuity and have helped propel and maintain the United States as the world’s largest economy;
:(3) according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, the United States fell to second place in 2009, and dropped to fourth place overall in 2010, however, in the“Quality of overall infrastructure”category of the same report, the United States ranked twenty-third in the world;
:(4) according to the World Bank’s 2010 Logistic Performance Index, the capacity of countries to efficiently move goods and connect manufacturers and consumers with international markets is improving around the world, and the United States now ranks seventh in the world in logistics-related infrastructure behind countries from both Europe and Asia;
:(5) according to a January 2009 report from the University of Massachusetts/Alliance for American Manufacturing entitled“Employment, Productivity and Growth,”infrastructure investment is a“highly effective engine of job creation”such that $1,000,000,000 in new investment in infrastructure results in 18,000 total jobs;
:(6) according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the current condition of the infrastructure in the United States earns a grade point average of D, and an estimated $2,200,000,000,000 investment is needed over the next 5 years to bring American infrastructure up to adequate condition;
:(7) according to the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade the United States surface transportation system to a state of good repair and create a more advanced system;
:(8) the current infrastructure financing mechanisms of the United States, both on the Federal and State level, will fail to meet current and foreseeable demands and will create large funding gaps;
:(9) traditional municipal bonds issued by State and local governments are proven to work and have been a part of the tax code for over 100 years, and additional infrastructure financing options can be created at the Federal level to complement the current system to best meet infrastructure needs;
:(10) new, additional financing mechanisms should be targeted and quickly implemented to—
::(A) serve large in-State or cross jurisdiction infrastructure projects, projects of regional or national significance, or projects that cross sector silos;
::(B) sufficiently catalyze private sector investment; or
::(C) ensure the optimal return on public resources;
:(11) although grant programs of the United States Government must continue to play a central role in financing the transportation, environment, and energy infrastructure needs of the United States, current and foreseeable demands on existing Federal, State, and local funding for infrastructure expansion clearly exceed the resources to support these programs by margins wide enough to prompt serious concerns about the United States ability to sustain long-term economic development, productivity, and international competitiveness;
:(12) the capital markets, including pension funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other investors, have a growing interest in infrastructure investment and represent hundreds of billions of dollars of potential investment; and
:(13) the establishment of a United States Government-owned, independent, professionally managed institution that could provide credit support to qualified infrastructure projects of regional and national significance, making transparent merit-based investment decisions based on the commercial viability of infrastructure projects, would catalyze the participation of significant private investment capital.

===(b) Purpose– ===

The purpose of this title is to facilitate investment in, and long-term financing of, economically viable infrastructure projects of regional or national significance in a manner that both complements existing Federal, State, local, and private funding sources for these projects and introduces a merit-based system for financing such projects, in order to mobilize significant private sector investment, create jobs, and ensure United States competitiveness through a self-sustaining institution that limits the need for ongoing Federal funding.
