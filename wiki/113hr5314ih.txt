 To amend title 31, United States Code, to enhance the Federal Government’s planning and preparation for extreme weather, and the Federal Government’s dissemination of best practices to respond to extreme weather, thereby increasing resiliency, improving regional coordination, and mitigating the financial risk to the Federal Government from such extreme weather.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “   Preparedness and Risk Management for Extreme Weather Patterns Assuring Resilience Act of 2014   ”or the“   PREPARE Act of 2014   ”.  

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds the following:
:(1) For the first time in history, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]included the need to address extreme weather in its 2013 High Risk List by declaring that this complex, cross-cutting issue“presents a significant financial risk to the federal government”.
:(2) The United States has sustained 151 weather-related disasters since 1980 where overall costs reached or exceeded $1 billion, with a total cost exceeding $1 trillion.
:(3) In 2012, the Federal Government spent nearly $100 billion because of droughts, storms, floods, and forest fires, and the costs of extreme weather in the United States totaled almost 1 percent of the Nation’s gross domestic product.
:(4) Every dollar spent on hazard mitigation brings a $4 return on investment.
:(5) The Federal Government has a number of non-permanent efforts underway to address extreme weather, including those outlined in Executive Order 13514, in Executive Order 13653, in [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]]Presidential Directive 20, in Presidential Policy Directive 8, and in individual Agency Adaptation Plans.
:(6) The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force recommendations included taking a resiliency approach to planning, design, and rebuilding in order to mitigate impacts of future extreme weather-related events.
:(7) In order to help communities plan for future extreme weather-related events, the National League of Cities urges the Federal Government to provide financial and technical assistance to help local governments assess vulnerabilities and mitigate such future events and to share best practices and resiliency strategies.
