{{Center|A BILL}}

 To delay the provision of the Affordable Care Act premium and cost-sharing subsidies until the eligibility verification process for such subsidies is completed, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   No Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) On July 5, 2013, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]released more than 600 pages of a final rule to implement the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (commonly referred to as“Obamacare”or the“ACA”).
:(2) Such final rule included an announcement that the Federal Government would no longer verify that each applicant for premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions for coverage offered through an Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are actually qualified for such credits or reductions. Instead, the Administration would rely on self-attestation and sample audits of a sample population to“protect”the integrity of this new $1 trillion entitlement program.
:(3) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]later announced a change in such policy and stated it would extend the sample population to 100 percent. This change, though announced, was never made to the final rule, meaning there was no guarantee to the American people that applicants would be verified.
:(4) It is estimated that not verifying eligibility for such credits and reductions could likely equate to approximately $250 billion in fraudulent payments through payments of such Obamacare premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions.
:(5) The final rule provides that the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]will offer to perform this verification procedure for States that are establishing a State-based Exchange, but will be unable to do so until 2015. As a result, such States will not be required to randomly verify employer-sponsored coverage until 2015.
:(6) In order to protect taxpayers after the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]failed to implement a new rule that it would ensure [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and taxpayers that verification of eligibility would be performed, the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]advanced legislation, H.R. 2775, the No Subsidies Without Verification Act. This legislation would have provided the force of law to ensure that verification would occur prior to the issuance of any Obamacare premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction.
:(7) On September 12, 2013, this legislation was passed in the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]with bipartisan support by a 235 to 191 vote margin.
:(8) On September 10, 2013, the
[[w:Barack Obama|Obama]]Administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy to H.R. 2775 that stated“the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2775 because the goal of the bill is already being accomplished while the text of the bill would create delays that could cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve”.
:(9) The Statement of Administration Policy also stated that“H.R. 2775 is unnecessary because the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]]has already put in place an effective and efficient system for verification of eligibility for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions.”.
:(10) On October 16, 2013, the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]removed the verification mechanism of H.R. 2775 and replaced it with language that required a report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]]no later than January 1, 2014.
:(11) On January 1, 2014, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]submitted a mandated report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]entitled,“Verification of Household Income and Other Qualifications for the Provision of Affordable Care At Premium Tax Credits and Cost-Sharing Reductions”.
:(12) This report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]states,“In accordance with statute and applicable implementing regulations, when a consumer submits an application for insurance affordability programs (which include APTCs, CSRs, [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Medicaid]], the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Basic Health Program (BHP)), the Exchange verifies information provided by the consumer on the application as a component of making an eligibility determination. The processes for verifying information in order to determine eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan (QHP) through the Exchange and for APTC under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) and CSRs under section 1402 of the ACA are specified in the ACA and its implementing regulations. Pursuant to both statute and applicable regulations, the Exchanges have implemented numerous processes to carry out the verification of information provided by applicants.”.
:(13) Beginning in 2014, Federal subsidies have been made available to help individuals purchase health insurance through an Exchange through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. On April 2014, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]delayed implementation of income ver­i­fi­ca­tion systems in order to increase sign-ups for health care plans through the healthcare.gov website.
:(14) Various reports indicate that the internal portions of the healthcare.gov website are yet to be finalized, thus leaving the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]unable to perform the verification it stated it was performing. The
[[w:Barack Obama|Obama]]Administration is operating a new Federal entitlement program that fails to prevent fraudulent subsidy claims before administered. In doing so, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]has created a new“pay and chase”program that places taxpayers at financial risk of fraudulent claims.
