Commission, Office of Information and Privacy, and Community Oriented Policing Services)|Attorney General]] represents the United States in legal matters and gives advice and opinions to the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and to the heads of the executive departments of the United States Government;Whereas the people of the United States need to have full confidence in the [[w:Offices, Boards and Divisions (includes the following: Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, Office of Policy Development, Office of Public Affairs, Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Legal Counsel, Solicitor General, Criminal Division, Civil Division, Civil Rights Division, Antitrust Division, Tax Division, Environment and Natural Resources Division,

Review, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, Office of Information and Privacy, and Community Oriented Policing Services)|Attorney General of the United States]] ;Whereas the people of the United States need assurance that the top law enforcement official in the United States will uphold the Constitution, and that he is competent, trustworthy, and beyond reproach;Whereas the people of the United States further expect that when mistakes are made, the Nation’s top law enforcement office will not seek to cover up such mistakes, but will cooperate with [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the American public in disclosing the events and circumstances and transparently addressing the issues;Whereas the current [[w:Offices, Boards and Divisions (includes the following: Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, Office of Policy Development, Office of Public Affairs, Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Legal Counsel, Solicitor General, Criminal Division, Civil Division, Civil Rights Division, Antitrust Division, Tax Division, Environment and Natural Resources Division, Justice Management Division, Office of Professional Responsibility, Office of the Pardon Attorney, U.S. National Central Bureau-INTERPOL, U.S. Parole Commission, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, Office of Information and Privacy, and Community Oriented Policing Services)|United States Attorney General]] , Eric Holder, presided over the Department of Justice as it conducted a law enforcement scheme called Operation Fast and Furious that was ill conceived at the outset and mismanaged for its duration;Whereas according to information obtained through the [[w:United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight and Government Reform Committee]] , Operation Fast and Furious allowed thousands of weapons of various types to be illegally sold and or transferred from the United States to violent drug cartels and known criminals in Mexico and elsewhere;Whereas weapons from Operation Fast and Furious have been used to violate United States laws, Mexican laws, and international laws, including homicide, kidnapping, and trafficking laws;Whereas under Attorney General Holder’s watch, this operation demonstrated no proper monitoring of the guns being sold or transferred, and failed to interdict the weapons;Whereas Attorney General Holder further failed to inform or cooperate with Mexican authorities even though weapons were being sent to Mexico;Whereas currently, Mexico is under severe stress due to drug cartel wars;Whereas in January 2012, the Government of Mexico confirmed that 47,515 people were killed in drug-related incidents between 2006 and 2011;Whereas credible sources estimate that at least 300 Mexican deaths involved weapons that came from Operation Fast and Furious;Whereas the carnage resulting from Operation Fast and Furious is not limited to Mexico;Whereas the people of the United States will likely also incur further violence as a result of this operation;Whereas due to Attorney General Holder’s failure to provide oversight or control over Operation Fast and Furious, drug cartels have used Fast and Furious weapons to wage attacks against United States law enforcement as well as Mexican police and military outfits;Whereas evidence further suggests that such guns have been used in the United States, and were found at the crime scene surrounding the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, who was killed on December 14, 2010;Whereas in response to Congressional inquiries, the Administration, through Attorney General Holder’s office, initially provided false information in a letter to Congress dated February 4, 2011, that was subsequently withdrawn;Whereas in response to Congressional inquiries, the Administration, through Attorney General Holder’s office, has redacted key information and has been intransigent, obstructionist, and obdurate;Whereas in response to [[w:Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] whistleblowers who came to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] for redress, the Administration, through Attorney General Holder’s office, retaliated against such whistleblowers;Whereas the Administration, at the request of Attorney General Holder, claimed executive privilege to block the disclosure of duly subpoenaed documents relating to a Congressional investigation; andWhereas Attorney General Holder was found in contempt of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] on June 28, 2012: Now, therefore, be it

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has lost confidence in the Attorney General of the United States and thereby calls for his immediate resignation.
