=Sec. 3. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) There is growing opportunity provided by technology in classrooms, for every grade, in every subject, and for all types of learners, to—
::(A) ensure that students are college-and-career ready; and
::(B) access the accelerating roll-out of online assessments.
:(2) Comprehensive education technology programs have shown great success in improving student achievement, reducing secondary school dropout rates, and improving graduation and college enrollment rates.
:(3) Mooresville Graded School District in the State of North Carolina has implemented an integrated education technology initiative, which has led to its ranking as the third highest achieving district in the State, with 21 percent composite achievement rate increases and 25 percent graduation rate increases over 5 years.
:(4) At Manor New Tech High School in the State of Texas, where 65 percent of students receive free or reduced price lunch under the  Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1751 42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.])and 75 percent are students of color, a project-based learning focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, has led to 62 percent of students being the first generation in their families to enroll in an institution of higher education and a near zero secondary school dropout rate.
:(5) At the City Arts and Technology High School Envisions in San Francisco, California, which emphasizes personalized learning environments, integration of arts and technology in project-based learning, and development of deeper learning skills, 98 percent of the graduates enrolled at an institution of higher education, 91 percent remained enrolled at such an institution, and 100 percent met the course requirements for entrance to the University of California.
:(6) The Federal Government placed a strong emphasis on technology professional development in the past decade, but no longer provides any funding support for such activities. Annual appropriations for grants awarded under the  Enhancing Education through Technology Act of 2001 under subpart D of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6751 20 U.S.C. 6751 et seq.])ended in 2010 and all funds appropriated by the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ([[Public Law 111-5|Public Law 111–5]] )for such grants were to have been spent by September 2011.
:(7) Online professional development courses offer excellent opportunities for educators to receive the training that they need 24 hours each day, 7 days each week. However, a recent survey indicates that only 25 percent of teachers make use of online professional development courses.
:(8) For technology to be fully integrated into classrooms and to ensure that students are college-and-career ready, it is critical that school administrators are confident in their abilities to use technology and thereby lead change in their schools and local educational agencies. The Federal Government must invest in building leadership skills and capacity for technology to truly take hold in our Nation’s schools.

:(3) ensure that educators have the knowledge and skills to develop and implement digital learning curriculum, use technology effectively in order to personalize and strengthen instruction, and effectively deliver and utilize assessments to measure student outcomes and support student success;
:(4) ensure that administrators have the leadership, management, knowledge, and skills to design, develop, and implement a school or local educational agency-wide digital age learning environment;
