{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of certified adult day services under the Medicare program.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Medicare Adult Day Services Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Adult day care can offer services, including medical care, rehabilitation therapies, dignified assistance with activities of daily living, nutrition therapy, health monitoring, social interaction, stimulating activities, and transportation, to seniors and people with disabilities at no extra cost to the Medicare program.
:(2) The care given at adult day services centers under an interdisciplinary team provides seniors, people with disabilities, and their familial caregivers with more care hours and additional services that are critical to keeping patients healthier and in the homes of the patients instead of in a nursing home, and reduces the risk of hospital admission or readmission.
