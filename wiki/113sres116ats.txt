{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating September 26, 2013, as“National Pediatric Brain Cancer Awareness Day”.    Whereas pediatric brain cancer, although rare, is the leading cause of cancer deaths among children and poses substantial health and developmental problems for an average of 3,000 child patients and their families in the United States each year;   Whereas children with brain cancer receive treatment at various types of medical establishments, including pediatric hospitals, pediatric oncology centers, and adult cancer facilities;   Whereas the parents, siblings, and families of children with brain cancer face unique difficulties, including ensuring the continuing education and development of children undergoing intensive surgical procedures, chemotherapy, and treatment;   Whereas children with brain cancer courageously face significant psychological, emotional, and social challenges due to their illness and the amount of time spent at treatment facilities away from their families, classmates, and friends;   Whereas a number of organizations, including the Team Jack Legacy Fund, in partnership with CureSearch for Children’s Cancer, have worked diligently to raise awareness, encourage diagnosis, and find an ultimate cure to pediatric brain cancer; and   Whereas, on April 6, 2013, 7-year-old pediatric brain cancer patient Jack Hoffman joined the lineup of the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers football team for its spring football game, wearing football pads and a number 22 jersey, and ran 69 yards to score a touchdown in front of more than 60,000 fans at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska, touching the hearts of millions of Americans and raising awareness of pediatric brain cancer: Now, therefore, be it
