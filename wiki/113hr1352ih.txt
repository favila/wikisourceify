=Sec. 3. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Safe supplies of water are fundamental to the health, economy, security, and ecology of the United States.
:(2) Research, development, and implementation of means and methods to protect the quality of the water resources of the United States will help ensure the continued existence of safe water to support—
::(A) increasing populations;
::(B) economic growth;
::(C) irrigated agriculture and a safe food supply; and
::(D) the protection of aquatic ecosystems.
:(3) The Colorado River is a multifaceted resource of the United States because—
::(A) the Colorado River is a natural wonder, a national treasure, and the lifeblood of the Southwest as it provides drinking water for more than 25,000,000 people and irrigates 1,800,000 acres of land, watering 15 percent of United States crops and over 80 percent of winter vegetables consumed in the United States;
::(B) the Colorado River is a major water recreation destination for boaters, fishermen, skiers, swimmers, hikers, and others with the Grand Canyon receiving approximately 4,500,000 visitors per year, the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area receiving approximately 2,000,000 visitors per year, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area receiving approximately 8,000,000 visitors per year; and
::(C) the Colorado River and its tributaries form a unique habitat that supports many rare and unusual species, including 36 native fish species (not including 2 that have already gone extinct), of which 25 species are found only in the Colorado River and its tributaries, 11 species are classified as endangered, 4 species are classified as threatened, and 5 species are classified as sensitive.
:(4) The Colorado River is endangered because—
::(A) the habitat along the Colorado River has been altered by dams, diversions, habitat loss and degradation, chemical pollution, and nonnative plant and animal species (including 62 nonnative species of fish), such that it is no longer the warm, silt-laden, sometimes turbulent, and ecologically balanced home to which native species are adapted, which has reduced the populations and ranges of many native species;
::(B) male fish in Las Vegas Bay of Lake Mead have relatively high levels of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), low levels of sex hormones, and shrunken testes associated with exposure to EDCs in effluent discharged into Las Vegas Wash and making its way into the lake, and this effluent will soon be directly discharged into Lake Mead instead of Las Vegas Wash;
::(C) the dangers of increasing levels of EDCs are exemplified by the condition of the San Francisco Bay Estuary, the source of drinking water for 25,000,000 Californians, where fish populations are crashing and young fish are born with brain, liver, and other deformities associated with high levels of environmental exposure to EDCs, which are making their way into people as evidenced by levels of the fire retardant polybrominated diphenyl ether reaching up to 100 times normal concentrations in the breast milk of Bay Area women;
::(D) nitrate pollution from degrading septic tanks presents a current and continuing threat to the health of the Lower Colorado River and the ecosystems and the health of the people that depend on it;
::(E) nitrate pollution also threatens the beneficial use of recreation along the Lower Colorado River because excess nitrates cause algal blooms, which die and decompose, deoxygenating the water and killing large numbers of fish;
::(F) run-off and return flows from agricultural lands into the Lower Colorado River and adjacent aquifers and waterways are rich in nitrates and sediment and high in salinity;
::(G) a number of chemicals in addition to nitrates are current or emerging threats to the Lower Colorado River, including uranium and other uranium mining by-products, selenium, hexavalent chromium, perchlorate, mercury, EDCs, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products;
::(H) known chemical and radioactive threats to the river include a 100-foot high, 130 acre, 10.5 million ton pile of uranium mill tailings located 750 feet from the river near Moab, Utah, and being remediated by the Department of Energy;
::(I) thousands of new mining claims, mostly for uranium, on Federal lands adjacent to the Grand Canyon are an emerging threat to the Colorado River;
::(J) known chemical threats to the river include 2 plumes of perchlorate rocket fuel near Henderson, Nevada, now being voluntarily remediated by the land owners, but previously making its way into lettuce grown over 200 miles away near Yuma, Arizona;
::(K) known chemical threats to the river include 2 plumes of hexavalent chromium near Topock, California, and Lake Havasu City, Arizona, being voluntarily remediated by the land owners;
::(L) quagga mussels, tamarisk, and other invasive species are disrupting ecosystems and threatening infrastructure and water quality in the Lower Colorado River; and
::(M) other types of contaminants and sources of pollution are a present danger to the Lower Colorado River, including pathogens, stormwater run-off, and salinity.
:(5) Demands on and needs of the Colorado River that are increasing stresses on the ecosystems and water resources of the Lower Colorado River are increasing because—
::(A) the population of California is projected to increase from 39,000,000 in 2010 to almost 60,000,000 in 2050, and the population of Arizona is projected to increase from 7,000,000 in 2010 to almost 13,000,000 in 2050;
::(B) population along the Lower Colorado River is expected to grow from its current 290,000 to 480,000 by 2025;
::(C) more than $2 billion is needed by 2025 to build the wastewater treatment plants necessary to ameliorate the danger to the Lower Colorado River from septic tanks; and
::(D) according to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the average annual temperature will increase by over 6 degrees Fahrenheit and annual run-off will decrease by 20 percent or more over much of the Lower Colorado River Basin by the end of the century. 

=Sec. 4. Declaration of goals=

::(C) protects the health of the millions of citizens of the United States who drink the water of the Lower Colorado River and eat the produce grown with water withdrawn from the Lower Colorado River.
:(2) To reduce the discharge of toxic pollutants into the Lower Colorado River to below toxic amounts and to remediate existing sources of toxic pollutants.
:(3) To develop and implement programs in an expeditious manner for the control of nonpoint sources of pollution to enable the goals of this Act to be met through the control of both point and nonpoint sources of pollution.
:(4) To complete research and development based on science and engineering to enable the goals of this Act to be met.
:(5) To empower the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]to take the lead in the effort to meet these goals, working with other Federal agencies and State and local authorities.
