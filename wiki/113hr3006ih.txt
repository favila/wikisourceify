{{Center|A BILL}}

 To authorize a land exchange involving the acquisition of private land adjacent to the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge in Arizona for inclusion in the refuge in exchange for certain Bureau of Land Management lands in Riverside County, California, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Certain non-Federal lands adjacent to the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge in La Paz County, Arizona, are desirable for Federal acquisition to protect important riparian areas and migratory bird and other wildlife habitat.
:(2) The location of certain Bureau of Land Management inholdings in Riverside County, California, renders the land essentially useful only for farming and, therefore, of limited use and enjoyment potential for the general public.
:(3) These [[w:Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]]in­hold­ings are appropriate for transfer to private ownership in exchange for lands that will have higher public use values.
:(4) The acquisition of the non-Federal lands adjacent to the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge will greatly increase management efficiency of the refuge and promote public access, use, and enjoyment of the refuge.
