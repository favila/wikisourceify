{{Center|A BILL}}

To safeguard military and civilian personnel on military bases by repealing bans on military personnel carrying firearms, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Safe Military Bases Act” .

=Sec. 2. Repeal of laws and regulations disarming firearms-trained military personnel and prohibition on reimposing bans on military personnel carrying firearms=



==(a) Definitions– ==

In this section:
:(1) The term firearms means only handguns.
:(2) The term military personnel means all members of the Armed Forces who are trained by the Armed Forces in the use of firearms.

==(b) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) In both the Fort Hood and Navy Yard shootings, military personnel unable to carry firearms by the military gun bans were unable to stop the shooters.
:(2) Military personnel are trained in firearms use and are prepared to protect and defend the United States at all times.
:(3) Military personnel are entrusted with firearms and other weapons in the defense of the United States.
:(4) Gun free zones attract mass-murderers. The Aurora, Colorado, shooter selected the single theater in the area that banned concealed-carry.
:(5) Following the Fort Hood terrorist attack, the world—including the Navy Yard shooter—learned that post-gun-ban military bases are inadequately defended targets. Such shootings may happen again as long as military personnel are disarmed.

==(c) Repeal of laws and regulations disarming firearms-Trained military personnel– ==
