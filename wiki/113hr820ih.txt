{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to enhance the reporting requirements pertaining to use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Antimicrobials are of critical importance to public health and to the American economy.
:(2) Use of antimicrobials, whether in human medicine or in agriculture, contributes to the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
:(3) Data from the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) indicate that approximately 80 percent of all antimicrobials sold in the United States, over 29,000,000 pounds in 2009, were sold for use in food animals.
:(4) A study published in September, 2012, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America found that even low doses of antimicrobials in animal feed for short periods of time increased the prevalence of the bacteria E. coli and the prevalence and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria in pigs.
:(5)   [[Public Law 110-316|Public Law 110–316]] , the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2008  , requires producers of drugs used in food animals to provide specified information annually to the FDA on the sales and indications for use of such drugs.
:(6) A September 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office found that the data provided to the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] under the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments Act of 2008 lacked sufficient details necessary to analyze trends in antimicrobial resistance, such as information on actual drug use in specific food-producing animal species. 

=Sec. 3. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to provide the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] and the public with better information on the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals used for food to—
:(1) enable public health officials and scientists to better understand and interpret trends and variations in rates of microbial resistance to such antimicrobial drugs;
:(2) improve the understanding of the relationship between antimicrobial drug use in animals used for food and antimicrobial drug resistance in microbes in and on animals and humans; and
:(3) identify interventions to prevent and control such antimicrobial drug resistance. 

=Sec. 4. Enhanced reporting requirements=



==(a) Reports– ==

   Section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360b 21 U.S.C. 360b(l)])is amended by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:

<blockquote> 
:(3) 
::(A) In the case of each new animal drug described in paragraph (1) that contains an antimicrobial active ingredient, the sponsor of the drug shall submit an annual report to the Secretary on the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient in the drug that is sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals, including information on any distributor-labeled product.
::(B) Each report under this paragraph shall specify the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient—
:::(i) by container size, strength, and dosage form;
:::(ii) by quantities distributed to each State domestically and by quantities exported; and
:::(iii) by dosage form, including (for each dosage form) the known or estimated amounts of the antimicrobial active ingredient sold or distributed for use in each food-producing animal for which the new animal drug is approved, including a description of the methods used to determine or estimate the amounts. 
:(4) 
::(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) , in the case of animal feed in final formulation bearing or containing a new animal drug for which reporting is required under paragraph (3) , a live poultry dealer, swine contractor, or feed lot operator who purchases, contracts, or manufactures such feed shall submit to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] an annual report that specifies, by food-producing animal for which the new animal drug is approved and, where applicable as determined by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] , by production class of such animal—
:::(i) the amount of each antimicrobial active ingredient contained per kilogram of each such feed sold or distributed for that animal and, where applicable, production class;
:::(ii) the quantity of such feed sold or distributed for that animal and, where applicable, production class; and
:::(iii) for each such feed sold or distributed under a veterinary feed directive—
::::(I) the indications for which the feed was sold or distributed and the quantities of such feed that were sold or distributed per each such indication;
::::(II) the number of individuals of the food-producing animal and, where applicable, the production class to which the feed was intended; and
::::(III) the length of time over which the feed was intended to be provided to the animals and the dose of the active antimicrobial ingredient the animals were intended to receive.
::(B) 
:::(i)   Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a live poultry dealer, swine contractor, or feed lot operator if the total value of the live animals owned, purchased, sold, contracted for, or otherwise controlled by the dealer, contractor, or operator, directly or through subsidiaries or affiliates, per year, does not exceed—
::::(I) $10,000,000; or
::::(II) such other sum as the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may specify through regulation.
:::(ii) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may specify through regulation alternative reporting requirements, including via pilot programs or based on the results of pilot programs—
::::(I) to improve the accuracy of reports;
::::(II) to lessen the burden of reporting;
::::(III) to facilitate the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary’s]] ability to provide public summaries of the reports; or
::::(IV) to improve the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary’s]] ability to use the reports, or the public’s ability to use the summaries under paragraph (5) , to understand the relationship between sales, distribution, and end-use practices with respect to feed containing new animal drugs described in paragraph (1) and antimicrobial resistance trends in microbes in animals, animal food products, and humans. 
:(5) 
::(A) Each report under paragraph (3) or (4) shall—
:::(i) be submitted electronically not later than March 31 each year;
:::(ii) cover the period of the preceding calendar year;

:::(i) drug sales for human use; and
:::(ii) rates of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria in and on animals, animal food products, and people.
::(C) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may share information reported under paragraph (3) or (4) with the Antimicrobial Resistance Task Force established under section 319E of the Public Health Service Act .
::(D) 
:::(i) Not later than November 30 each year, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall make publicly available summaries of the information reported under paragraphs (3) and (4) .

::::(I) report data by antimicrobial drug class;
::::(II) for each such antimicrobial drug class, specify—

::::(III) for each feed sold or distributed under a veterinary food directive for which reporting is required under paragraph (4) , include the information reported pursuant to subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of paragraph (4)(A)(iii) .
:::(iii) For any antimicrobial drug class with fewer than 3 sponsors of approved new animal drugs, instead of reporting data under clause (ii) , the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall for each such class—
::::(I) report data by category of importance of the antimicrobial drugs within that class to human medicine, as determined by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] ; and
::::(II) to the extent feasible for each such category, specify—
