{{Center|A BILL}}

 To permit employees to request changes to their work schedules without fear of retaliation, and to ensure that employers consider these requests; and to require employers to provide more predictable and stable schedules for employees in certain growing low-wage occupations, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title; findings=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“   Schedules That Work Act   ”.

==(b) Findings– ==

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The vast majority of the United States workforce today is juggling responsibilities at home and at work. Women are primary breadwinners or co-breadwinners in 63 percent of families in the United States and 26 percent of families with children are headed by single mothers.
:(2) Despite the dual responsibilities of today’s workforce, workers across the income spectrum have very little ability to make changes to their work schedules when those changes are needed to accommodate family responsibilities. Only 27 percent of employers allow all or most of their employees to periodically change their starting and quitting times.
:(3) Although low-wage workers are most likely to be raising children on their own, as more than half of mothers of young children in low-wage jobs are doing, low-wage workers have the least control over their work schedules and the most unpredictable schedules. For example—
::(A) roughly half of low-wage workers reported very little or no control over the timing of the hours they were scheduled to work;
::(B) many workers in low-wage jobs receive their schedules with very little advance notice and have work hours that vary significantly from week to week or month to month;
::(C) some workers in low-wage jobs are sent home from work when work is slow without being paid for their scheduled shift;
::(D) in some industries, the use of“call-in shift”requirements—requirements that workers call in to work to find out whether they will be scheduled to work later that day—has become common practice; and
::(E) at the same time, 20 to 30 percent of workers in low-wage jobs struggle with being required to work extra hours with little or no notice.
:(4) Unfair work scheduling practices make it difficult for low-wage workers to—
::(A) provide necessary care for children and other family members, including arranging child care;
::(B) qualify for and maintain eligibility for child care subsidies, due to fluctuations in income and work hours, or keep an appointment with a child care provider, due to not knowing how many hours or when the workers will be scheduled to work;
::(C) pursue workforce training;
::(D) get or keep a second job that some part-time workers need to make ends meet; and
::(E) arrange transportation to and from work.
:(5) Unpredictable and unstable schedules are prevalent in retail sales, food preparation and service, and building cleaning occupations, which are among the lowest-paid and fastest-growing occupations in the workforce today. For workers in those occupations, often difficult and sometimes abusive work scheduling practices combine with very low wages to make it extremely challenging to make ends meet.
:(6) Retail sales, food preparation and service, and building cleaning occupations are among those most likely to have unpredictable and unstable schedules. According to data from the [[w:Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor Statistics]], 66 percent of food service workers, 52 percent of retail workers, and 40 percent of janitors and housekeepers know their schedules only a week or less in advance. The average variation in work hours in a single month is 70 percent for food service workers, 50 percent for retail workers, and 40 percent for janitors and housekeepers.
:(7) Those are among the lowest-paid and fastest-growing occupations, accounting for 18 percent of workers in the economy, some 23,500,000 workers. The median pay for workers in those 3 occupations is between $9.15 and $10.44 per hour, and women make up more than half of the workers in those occupations.
:(8) Employers that have implemented fair work scheduling policies that allow workers to have more control over their work schedules, and provide more predictable and stable schedules, have experienced significant benefits, including reductions in absenteeism and workforce turnover, and increased employee morale and engagement.
:(9) This Act is a first step in responding to the needs of workers for a voice in the timing of their work hours and for more predictable schedules.
