{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week of August 10 through August 16, 2014, as“National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week”.    Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit, community-based health care sites that offer primary care and wellness services based on the nursing model;   Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, promotion, and optimization of health, the prevention of illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the diagnosis and treatment of illness;   Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced practice nurses and staffed by an interdisciplinary team of highly qualified health care professionals;   Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of services, including treatment for acute and chronic illnesses, routine physical exams, immunizations for adults and children, disease screenings, health education, prenatal care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;   Whereas, as of March 2014, approximately 500 nurse-managed health clinics provided care across the United States and recorded more than 2,500,000 patient encounters annually;   Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual role as both health care safety net access points and health workforce development sites, given that the majority of nurse-managed health clinics are affiliated with schools of nursing and serve as clinical education sites for students entering the health profession;   Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health care safety net by expanding access to primary care and chronic disease management services for vulnerable and medically underserved populations in diverse rural, urban, and suburban communities;   Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health clinics experience high patient retention and patient satisfaction rates and nurse-managed health clinic patients experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety net providers;   Whereas the 2010 report of the Institute of Medicine entitled “The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health,” highlights the work nurse-managed health clinics are doing to reduce health disparities by bringing evidence-based care to individuals who may not otherwise receive needed services; and   Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offering both primary care and wellness services provide quality care in a cost-effective manner: Now, therefore, be it
