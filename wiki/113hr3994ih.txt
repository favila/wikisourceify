==(b) Strategic plan– ==

The Secretary concerned shall develop a strategic plan for the implementation of the invasive species program of that Secretary to endeavor to achieve an annual five percent net reduction of invasive species populations on lands managed by that Secretary.

=Sec. 4. Program funding allocations=



==(a) Control and management activities– ==

Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made available to the Secretary concerned for a fiscal year for programs that address or include invasive species management, the Secretary concerned shall use not less than 75 percent of the amount for on-the-ground control and management of invasive species, including through—
:(1) the purchase of necessary products, equipment, or services to conduct such control and management;
:(2) the use of integrated pest management options, including pesticides authorized for sale, distribution, or use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/136 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq] .);
:(3) the use of biological control agents that are proven to be effective to reduce invasive species populations;
