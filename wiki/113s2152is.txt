=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]believes that the United States energy policy must have“an all-of-the-above strategy for the 21st century that develops every source of American-made energy”;
:(2) according to the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]], 37 percent of all energy generated in the United States comes from coal and by 2040, coal will still account for 32 percent of energy generation in the United States;
:(3) the United States has enough recoverable coal reserves to last at least another 250 years;
:(4) as the world becomes increasingly carbon constrained, coal-fired power plants must increasingly be integrated with carbon capture and storage systems;
:(5) efficiency improvements to the coal fleet will decrease carbon emissions and use less coal while providing the same power;
:(6) the potential to increase efficiency is evident in the current fleet of power plants in the United States, as the top 10 percent of coal plants have efficiencies as high as 37 percent while the average plant has an efficiency of 32 percent;
:(7) efficiencies as high as 48 percent may be attained with ultrasupercritical coal-fired power plants;
:(8) replacing the average subcritical coal-fired power plant with a supercritical or ultrasupercritical coal-fired power plant would reduce carbon emissions by 18 to 22 percent per megawatt hour of energy generated; and
:(9) the coal industry is a significant source of jobs in the United States as in 2012 alone, coal was responsible for 137,650 jobs for coal miners, 92,472 jobs for operator employees, and 45,178 jobs for contractors.
