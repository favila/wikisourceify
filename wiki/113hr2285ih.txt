[[w:Jim Matheson|Mr. Matheson]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Public Health Service Act to enhance efforts to address antimicrobial resistance, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Strategies to Address Antimicrobial Resistance Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) The advent of the antibiotic era has saved millions of lives and allowed for incredible medical progress; however, the increased use and overuse of antimicrobial drugs have correlated with increased rates of antimicrobial resistance.
:(2) Through mutation as well as other mechanisms, bacteria and other infectious disease-causing organisms—viruses, fungi, and parasites—develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs over time. The more antimicrobial drugs are used, whether appropriately or inappropriately, the more this contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance.
:(3) Scientific evidence suggests that the development of antimicrobial resistance in humans is not due only to use of antimicrobial drugs in humans, but also may be caused by the use of antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals.
:(4) A study estimates that in 2005 more than 94,000 invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacterial infections occurred in the United States and more than 18,500 of these infections resulted in death—7 times more than a decade earlier.
:(5) The 2009 Influenza A: H1N1 virus outbreak, and the yearly seasonal influenza outbreaks, exacerbate concerns about antiviral resistance given that so few antivirals are available to treat influenza as well as secondary bacterial infections due to MRSA, antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia, and other bacteria that cause respiratory diseases. Given that, during the 1918 influenza pandemic, many thousands of deaths were caused by complications due to secondary bacterial infections and not by the influenza virus itself.
:(6) Each year, nearly 2,000,000 people contract bacterial infections in hospitals and approximately 90,000 of these people die from these infections. Many of these infections are resistant to one or more commonly used antibiotics.
:(7) A 2012 study conducted at Columbia University ( Clinical Infectious Disease , September 2012) found that each antibiotic-resistant infection cost, on average, over $15,000 more to treat than susceptible infections.
:(8) The costs of antimicrobial-resistant infections in terms of lives lost and the economy will only rise as antimicrobial resistance continues to spread.
