==Title I— Authorization of Appropriations==



==Sec. 101. Sense of Congress==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that a strong, robust [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]program is in the national interest.

:(2) indicates whether changes are needed to the manner in which [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]procures and manages similar services upon the expiration of the existing Commercial Resupply Services contract; and
:(3) identifies any lessons learned from the Commercial Resupply Services contract that should be applied to the procurement and management of commercially provided crew transfer services to and from the ISS.

===Sec. 216. Crew transportation to and from the ISS===



====(a) Objective– ====

The objective of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program shall be to assist the development of at least one crew transportation system to carry [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]astronauts safely, reliably, and affordably to and from the ISS and to serve as an emergency crew rescue vehicle as soon as practicable within the funding levels authorized in this Act.

====(b) Sense of congress– ====

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that once developed and certified to meet [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA’s]]safety and reliability requirements, United States commercially provided crew transportation systems offer the potential of serving as the primary means of transporting American astronauts and international partner astronauts to and from the ISS and serving as ISS emergency crew rescue vehicles. At the same time, the budgetary assumptions used by [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]in its planning for the Commercial Crew Program have consistently assumed significantly higher funding levels than have historically been authorized and appropriated by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]. It is the sense of Congress that credibility in the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration’s]]budgetary estimates for the Commercial Crew Program can be enhanced by an independently developed cost estimate. It is further the sense of Congress that this lack of budgetary realism in the planning process creates unnecessary inefficiencies and increased programmatic risk, and [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]should thus adjust its planning process to realistically reflect the levels of funding authorized in this Act. NASA’s plans indicate that it will not be able to begin contracted-for crew transportation resupply operational flights until fiscal year 2018 even under its optimistic funding assumptions, which means that [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]is not likely to have a requirement for more than a total of 8 commercially provided crew rotation flights prior to the expiration of the current Congressional commitment to continued operation of the ISS in 2020. Thus, it is also the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that the highest priority of the Commercial Crew Program should be assisting the development of a safe, reliable, and affordable crew transportation system for transporting [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]astronauts to and from the ISS as soon as practicable within the funding levels authorized in this Act rather than making a specific date for the initiation of operational service drive the program planning.

:(A) all activities associated with the development, test, demonstration, and certification of commercial crew transportation systems; and
:(B) transportation and rescue services required by [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]for ISS operations through calendar year 2020 or later if [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]requirements so dictate.

=====(2) Transmittal– =====

Not later than one year after initiation of the Independent Cost Estimate under paragraph (1) , the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall transmit the results of the Independent Cost Estimate to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]].

The number of systems selected shall be consistent with the funding levels authorized in this Act. The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall identify a methodology by which [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]will ensure that the Government is not charged for contractor costs incurred during development, testing, demonstration, and certification activities by an awardee of the Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contract for operational commercial crew transportation services.

=====(3) Cost minimization– =====

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall strive through the competitive selection process to minimize the life cycle cost to [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]through the planned period of commercially provided crew transportation services.

====(e) Safety– ====

Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall seek to ensure that minimization of the probability of loss of crew shall be an important selection criterion in the competitive selection described in subsection (d) .

====(f) Determination of cost-Effectiveness of services– ====

  [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]], prior to contracting for commercial crew transportation services, shall identify the manner by which it will establish whether such transportation services provide an equally or more cost-effective alternative to current services.

====(g) Operational services contract– ====
