{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of March 2014 as“Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month”to increase public awareness of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the autonomic functions of the body.    Whereas Multiple System Atrophy is a fatal neurological disease diagnosed in approximately 15,000 patients in the United States;   Whereas as many as 35,000 more patients in the United States with Multiple System Atrophy are misdiagnosed with other more recognizable neurodegenerative disorders;   Whereas patients with Multiple System Atrophy lose the ability to walk, talk, chew, swallow, and even breathe over the course of a few years;   Whereas the incidence of Multiple System Atrophy in the United States has increased in recent years;   Whereas no specific risk factors or causes of Multiple System Atrophy have been identified;   Whereas there is currently no cure for Multiple System Atrophy;   Whereas the lack of awareness about Multiple System Atrophy has hindered research and the ability of researchers to obtain funding for their work;   Whereas public support and greater awareness of the need for research funding can aid in the discovery of the cause of and a cure for Multiple System Atrophy; and   Whereas March 2014 would be an appropriate month to designate as“Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month”: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]supports the designation of“Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month”to increase public awareness of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the autonomic functions of the body.
