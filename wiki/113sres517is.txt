[[w:|Mr. Graham]](for himself,
[[w:|Mr. Schumer]],
[[w:|Ms. Ayotte]],
[[w:|Mr. Cardin]],
[[w:|Mr. Rubio]], and
[[w:|Mr. Blumenthal]]) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Committee on Foreign Relations]] }}

  
{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for Israel's right to defend itself and calling on Hamas to immediately cease all rocket and other attacks against Israel.    Whereas, on July 17, 2014, the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]unanimously passed a resolution supporting Israel’s absolute right to defend its citizens and ensure the survival of the State of Israel, condemning the actions of Hamas, and calling for the President of the Palestinian Authority to dissolve the unity government with Hamas;   Whereas, since June 2014, Hamas has fired over 1,800 rockets at Israel;   Whereas Hamas has used a system of tunnels to smuggle weapons and launch attacks on Israel;   Whereas, since ground operations in Gaza began, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have discovered 28 of these tunnels whose only purpose is to kill and kidnap Israelis;   Whereas Hamas’ weapons arsenal includes approximately 12,000 rockets that vary in range;   Whereas innocent Israeli civilians are indiscriminately targeted by Hamas rocket attacks;   Whereas 5,000,000 Israelis are currently living under the threat of rocket attacks from Gaza;   Whereas the Iron Dome system has saved countless lives inside Israel;   Whereas, consistent with Article 51 of the United Nations charter, which recognizes a nation’s right to self-defense, Israel must be allowed to take any actions necessary to remove those threats;   Whereas the IDF has used text messages, leaflet drops, phone calls, and other methods to clear out areas and avoid unnecessary civilian casualties;   Whereas Hamas uses civilians in Gaza as human shields by placing missile launchers next to schools, hospitals, mosques, and private homes;   Whereas Hamas’ interior ministry has called on residents of Gaza to ignore IDF warning to get out of harm’s way; and   Whereas any effort to broker a ceasefire agreement that does not eliminate those threats cannot be sustained in the long run and will leave Israel vulnerable to future attacks: Now, therefore, be it
