shitburger[[w:|Mr. Durbin]] (for himself and
shitburger[[w:|Mr. Kirk]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Committee on Environment and Public Works]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a pilot program to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of allowing non-Federal interests to carry out certain water infrastructure projects, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Water Infrastructure Now Public-Private Partnership Act” or the “WIN P3 Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) investment in water infrastructure is critical to protecting property and personal safety through flood, hurricane, and storm damage reduction activities;
:(2) investment in infrastructure on the inland waterways of the United States is critical to the economy of the United States through the maintenance of safe, reliable, and efficient navigation for recreation and the movement of billions of dollars in goods each year;
:(3) fiscal challenges facing Federal, State, local, and tribal governments require new and innovative financing structures to continue robust investment in public water infrastructure;
:(4) under existing fiscal restraints and project delivery processes, large-scale water infrastructure projects like the lock and dam modernization on the upper Mississippi River and Illinois River will take decades to complete, with benefits for the lock modernization not expected to be realized until 2047;
:(5) the [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] has an estimated backlog of more than $60,000,000,000 in outstanding projects; and
:(6) in developing innovative financing options for water infrastructure projects, any prior public investment in projects must be protected.

=Sec. 3. Water infrastructure now pilot program=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] , acting through the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Chief of Engineers]] , shall establish a pilot program to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and project delivery efficiency of allowing non-Federal interests to carry out authorized flood damage reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and navigation projects.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of the pilot program are—
:(1) to identify project delivery and cost-saving alternatives that reduce the backlog of authorized [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] projects;
:(2) to evaluate the technical, financial, and organizational efficiencies of a non-Federal interest carrying out the design, execution, management, and construction of 1 or more projects; and
:(3) to evaluate alternatives for the decentralization of the project planning, management, and operational decision-making processes of the [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] .

:(B) notify the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate]] and the [[w:United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives]] upon the identification of each project under the pilot program;
:(C) in consultation with the non-Federal interest, develop a detailed project management plan for each identified project that outlines the scope, budget, design, and construction resource requirements necessary for the non-Federal interest to execute the project, or a separable element of the project;
:(D) on the request of the non-Federal interest, enter into a project partnership agreement with the non-Federal interest for the non-Federal interest to provide full project management control for construction of the project, or a separable element of the project, in accordance with plans approved by the Secretary;
:(E) following execution of the project partnership agreement, transfer to the non-Federal interest to carry out construction of the project, or a separable element of the project—
::(i) if applicable, the balance of the unobligated amounts appropriated for the project, except that the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary]] shall retain sufficient amounts for the [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] to carry out any responsibilities of the [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] relating to the project and pilot program; and
::(ii) additional amounts, as determined by the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary]] , from amounts made available under section 5, except that the total amount transferred to the non-Federal interest shall not exceed the estimate of the Federal share of the cost of construction, including any required design; and
:(F) regularly monitor and audit each project being constructed by a non-Federal interest under this section to ensure that the construction activities are carried out in compliance with the plans approved by the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary]] and that the construction costs are reasonable.
