To make demonstration grants to eligible local educational agencies for the purpose of reducing the student-to-school nurse ratio in public elementary schools and secondary schools.

={{anchor|HC49A0D3523C44AF7B4C86D1550890E27}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Student-to-School Nurse Ratio Improvement Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H92F325DE267347E6BC6F6A39EB8676D9}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes the crucial role of school nurses in the seamless provision of comprehensive health services to children and youth, as well as in the development of a coordinated school health program.
:(2) The school nurse functions as a leader and the coordinator of the school health services team, facilitating access to a medical home for each child and supporting academic achievement.
:(3) School nurses promote wellness and disease prevention to improve health outcomes for our Nation’s children. In addition, school nurses perform early intervention services such as periodic assessments for vision, hearing, and dental problems, in an effort to remove barriers to learning.
:(4) Recent national data indicates 45 percent of public schools have a school nurse all day, every day, while another 30 percent of schools have a school nurse who works part time in one or more schools.
:(5) The American Nurses Association has reported that when there is no registered nurse on the school premises, the responsibility to administer the necessary medications and treatments, and appropriate monitoring of the children falls on the shoulders of administrators, educators, and staff who are ill-prepared to perform these tasks.
:(6) Statistics from the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Educational Statistics]] indicate that of the 52,000,000 students who currently spend their day in schools, 15 to 18 percent of children and adolescents have a chronic health condition.
:(7) A recent study indicated that from 2002 to 2008, the percentage of children in special education with health impairments, due to chronic or acute health problems, increased 60 percent. School nurses use their specialized knowledge, assessment skills, and judgment to manage children’s increasingly complex medical conditions and chronic health illnesses.
:(8) Among adolescents aged 12 to 19 years old, the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes increased from 9 percent to 23 percent between 1999 and 2008. More than 30 percent of children aged 2 to 19 years old are obese or overweight (>85th percentile). In 2008, more than 10 million children in the United States had asthma. The prevalence of food allergies among children under the age of 18 increased 19 percent from 1997 to 2007.
:(9) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, students today face increased social and emotional issues, which enhance the need for preventive services and interventions for acute and chronic health issues. School nurses are actively engaged members of school-based mental health teams and spend nearly 32 percent of their time providing mental health services, including universal and targeted interventions, screenings to identify early warning signs and referrals to medical providers, and crisis planning.
:(10) In 2011, the [[w:Bureau of the Census|Bureau of the Census]] reported 9.7 percent of children under the age of 19, which equals 7.6 million children under the age of 19, were without health insurance. Data shows that uninsured children achieve lower educational outcomes than those with health coverage. Children who cannot afford to see a medical provider miss more days of school, experience increased severity of illness, and suffer from disparities in health.
:(11) More than 1.6 million children experience homelessness each year in the United States. Homeless children develop increased rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and the stress of their living situation can negatively affect their development and ability to learn. As a result, schools have become the primary access to health care for many children and adolescents. School nurses serve on the frontlines as a safety net for the Nation’s most vulnerable children.
:(12) Communicable and infectious diseases account for millions of school days lost each year. Data illustrate that when students have access to a registered nurse in school, immunization rates increase.
:(13) A 2011 study showed that a school nurse in the building saves principals, teachers, and clerical staff a considerable amount of time that they would have spent addressing health concerns of students, including saving principals almost an hour a day; saving teachers almost 20 minutes a day; and saving clerical staff more than 45 minutes a day. This would amount to a savings of about 13 hours per day in the aggregate for such school personnel.
:(14) Using a formula-based approach, taking into consideration the overall health acuity of the student body and the workload of school nurses, for determining a balanced student-to-school nurse ratio offers a reasonable means for achieving better student outcomes.
