=={{section|H1D080EB4EC5E4001B366C31EC1A192AA|I RECOGNITION OF TRUST RESPONSIBILITY}}==

{{section|H00C423C6972045A8ABAB15093C4414F6|101. Congressional statement of findings}}
The
			 [[United States Congress|Congress]], after careful review of the Federal Government’s historical and
			 special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, American
			 Indian people, finds that—
(1)
the relationship
			 of Indian tribes to the United States is founded in part on the settled
			 doctrine of the law of nations that when a stronger sovereign assumes authority
			 over a weaker sovereign, the stronger one assumes a duty of protection for the
			 weaker one, which does not surrender its right to self-government;

(2)
the United States
			 fiduciary responsibilities to Indians also constitutes a foundational basis
			 for, not merely a function of, congressional legislation regarding Indians
			 because it constitutes an inherent presupposition of our constitutional
			 structure, which provides an inherent limit on the exercise and application of
			 the Indian Commerce Clause and the Treaty Clause of the Constitution;

(3)
the United States
			 fiduciary responsibilities to Indians also are founded in part on specific
			 commitments made through written treaties and agreements securing peace, in
			 exchange for which Indians have surrendered claims to vast tracts of land,
			 which provided legal consideration for permanent, ongoing performance of
			 Federal trust duties; and

(4)
the foregoing
			 historic Federal-tribal relations and understandings have benefitted the people
			 of the United States as a whole for centuries and established enduring and
			 enforceable Federal obligations to which the national honor has been
			 committed.


{{section|H8FDE5C55C3A843678FF490109ABCD3BC|102. Congressional reaffirmation of policy}}
Pursuant to its constitutionally vested
			 authority over Indian affairs, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] hereby reaffirms the following
			 regarding the proper discharge of the United States fiduciary responsibilities
			 to Indians—
(1)
enforceable
			 fiduciary duties necessarily arise when the United States assumes control or
			 supervision over tribal trust assets even though nothing is said expressly in
			 the governing statutes or regulations, unless [[United States Congress|Congress]] has expressly specified
			 otherwise;

(2)
in general, the
			 most exacting common-law fiduciary standards which govern private trustees also
			 govern the United States when it manages Indian trust assets, and enforceable
			 Federal trust duties for Indian trust asset management are not limited to the
			 express terms of statutes and regulations;

(3)
the fact that the
			 United States simultaneously performs another task for another interest that
			 [[United States Congress|Congress]] has obligated it by statute to do does not compromise or limit the
			 United States enforceable fiduciary obligations to Indians; and

(4)
the United States
			 fiduciary responsibilities to Indian tribes include and are not limited by a
			 duty to promote tribal self-determination regarding governmental authority and
			 economic development.
