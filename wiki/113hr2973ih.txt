{{Center|A BILL}}

To authorize the Secretary of Interior to carry out projects and conduct research on water resources in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin, to establish a Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Commission, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin together with the Erie Canal connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and includes the 13,400 square mile area encompassing five large sub-basins: the Upper Hudson River sub-basin, the Mohawk River sub-basin, the Lower Hudson River sub-basin, the Passaic River sub-basin, and the Raritan River sub-basin.
:(2) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin played an essential role in the birth of our Nation and its westward expansion. The water of the Hudson-Mohawk Basin is the ink used to write the early United States history of European settlement and the American Revolution. The Basin’s rivers served as a major transportation corridor connecting the communities along it from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes.
:(3) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin includes the largest metropolitan area of the country: the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area. This metropolitan area, together with the many communities in the Upper Hudson, Mohawk, and Lower Hudson sub-basins, makes the area one of the most densely and heavily populated river basins in the country with over 15,000,000 people.
:(4) The water resources of the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin are functionally interrelated and their uses are interdependent. A single entity is essential to provide effective communication, coordination, and cooperation among Federal, State, and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector for this area.
:(5) The New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary is a complex natural harbor at the junction of three major water bodies, the New York Bight, the Hudson River and the Long Island Sound. In addition, it receives freshwater inputs from the Raritan and Passaic Rivers. The health and productivity of the New York Bight is affected directly by the quality of the freshwater inputs to the estuary from the Hudson, Passaic, and Raritan Rivers.
:(6) The headwaters of the Hudson originate within the Adirondack Mountains, a treasured northeastern wilderness area, protected under the New York State constitution since 1894. The Hudson’s path south through the Hudson River Highlands, and the Mohawk’s path south east to its junction with the Hudson, provides the only natural break in the Appalachian Mountain chain.
:(7) The Mohawk Valley’s abundant natural resources, and fertile floodplain soils provided a rich endowment that first supported the Mohawk nation and the Iroquois Confederacy and later supported European settlement and the development of industry and commerce.
:(8) The Mohawk River and its watershed drain directly into the Hudson River providing the largest freshwater input to the brackish water mix that characterizes the Hudson River Estuary and supports a biologically rich and productive ecosystem.
:(9) The Mohawk River is integrated with the Erie Canal along much of its channel. Therefore, tying the operation of the Canal system to the health of the Mohawk and the Hudson Rivers.
:(10) Individuals in many communities throughout the Basin have experienced devastating flooding that led to tremendous costs for businesses, State, and local governments. A holistic approach to river and stream monitoring, updated floodplain maps, and development of floodplain management strategies based upon improved understanding of the Basin’s hydrology would make communities safer and more resistant and resilient to flood events.
:(11) Climate change is occurring and, as a result, sea level rise along the United States eastern coastline will increase the vulnerability of coastal communities to storm surge and flooding in the New York-New Jersey harbors and along the major rivers in the Basin.
:(12) Each of the subwatersheds of the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin receives support of programs administered by Federal, State, regional, and local organizations.
:(13) There has been little integration of planning and program implementation to address the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin in a holistic manner.
:(14) New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut have a long history of achievements working together on resource management issues through their memberships in the Delaware River Basin Commission, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, and the Lake Champlain Basin Program.
:(15) The basin-wide impacts experienced as a result of recent hurricanes and storms illustrate the need for integrated, basin-wide planning to address water management challenges and vulnerability to flooding.
:(16) Protection and restoration of wetlands, expanded use of green infrastructure, strengthening of dams and levees, and upgrading of wastewater and water treatment infrastructure will be necessary to reduce the impacts of extreme weather events and maintain water quality and public health.
:(17) Development and implementation of projects to control flooding and improve water quality must be done with the full participation of local communities and citizens, address the needs they identify, and be conducted in a manner that respects private property and is consistent with the authorities of state and local jurisdictions.
