{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants for recruiting, training, and retaining individuals, with a preference for individuals from underrepresented groups, as teachers at public elementary and secondary schools, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Diverse Teachers Recruitment Act of 2013”.

2. Findings and purposes


=(a) Findings=

[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:: Issues of teacher diversity and cultural awareness are critical factors influencing the achievement gap among elementary school and secondary school students and must be addressed by national education policy, as recommended in the report entitled “Assessment of Diversity in America's Teaching Force ”, presented by the National Collaborative on Diversity in the Teaching Force in 2004.: Some experts believe the lack of diversity among public schoolteachers inhibits positive learning outcomes generally, and can leave students in underrepresented groups without role models to whom the students can relate, which may lead to poorer performance in the classroom. Statistics show that for students in some underrepresented groups, a lack of diversity among public school teachers contributes to lower standardized test scores and lower graduation rates.: [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Education|Department of Education ]]statistics confirm a lack of diversity among public schoolteachers. During the school year of 2007 through 2008, an estimated 83.1 percent of public schoolteachers were Caucasian, while 7.1 percent were Latino, 7 percent were African-American, and 1.2 percent were Asian. Of all public schoolteachers, 24.1 percent were male and 75.9 percent were female.: Teacher demographics should be sufficiently diverse to provide the educational benefits described in paragraphs (1) and (2), including ensuring that students have role models—:: from diverse backgrounds and racial and ethnic groups; and:: of different genders.
=(b) Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are—: to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that result, particularly for schools with a concentration of individuals in 1 or more categories described in section 1111(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) ) , from a diverse group of elementary school and secondary school teachers, including—:: promoting learning outcomes generally, and reducing achievement gaps for diverse student bodies; and:: increasing student cultural awareness by better preparing students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society;: to provide narrowly tailored activities by funding the activities for the period needed to attain meaningful numbers or a critical mass of teachers who are individuals from underrepresented groups, sufficient to address the low employment of teachers from such groups, and offering the activities for other teachers as well; and: to remedy the historically low employment among teachers in public elementary schools and secondary schools who are individuals from underrepresented groups.
3. Recruitment, training, and retention of teachers, including teachers from underrepresented groups

Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq. ) is amended by adding at the end the following new part:
