This Act may be cited as the
			 “Diverse Teachers Recruitment Act of
			 2013”.

={{anchor|H6EB99E8666994B3D831512798EFB0992}}Sec. 2. Findings and
			 purposes=



=={{anchor|H5D86710E0436489884FF213DA6F8F9BB}}(a) Findings– ==

[[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Issues of teacher
			 diversity and cultural awareness are critical factors influencing the
			 achievement gap among elementary school and secondary school students and must
			 be addressed by national education policy, as recommended in the report
			 entitled “Assessment of Diversity in America's Teaching Force”,
			 presented by the National Collaborative on Diversity in the Teaching Force in
			 2004.
:(2) Some experts believe the lack of diversity
			 among public schoolteachers inhibits positive learning outcomes generally, and
			 can leave students in underrepresented groups without role models to whom the
			 students can relate, which may lead to poorer performance in the classroom.
			 Statistics show that for students in some underrepresented groups, a lack of
			 diversity among public school teachers contributes to lower standardized test
			 scores and lower graduation rates.
:(3) [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of
			 Education]] statistics confirm a lack of diversity among public schoolteachers.
			 During the school year of 2007 through 2008, an estimated 83.1 percent of
			 public schoolteachers were Caucasian, while 7.1 percent were Latino, 7 percent
			 were African-American, and 1.2 percent were Asian. Of all public
			 schoolteachers, 24.1 percent were male and 75.9 percent were female.
:(4) Teacher demographics should be sufficiently
			 diverse to provide the educational benefits described in paragraphs (1) and
			 (2), including ensuring that students have role models—
::(A) from diverse backgrounds and racial and
			 ethnic groups; and
::(B) of different genders.

=={{anchor|H6885FA8CC1144A18B378A73687D05E89}}(b) Purposes– ==

The
			 purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to further a
			 compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that result,
			 particularly for schools with a concentration of individuals in 1 or more
			 categories described in section 1111(b)(2)(C)(v)(II) of the Elementary and
			 Secondary Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6311 20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(2)(C)(v)(II)]), from a
			 diverse group of elementary school and secondary school teachers,
			 including—
::(A) promoting learning
			 outcomes generally, and reducing achievement gaps for diverse student bodies;
			 and
::(B) increasing student
			 cultural awareness by better preparing students for an increasingly diverse
			 workforce and society;
:(2) to provide narrowly tailored activities by
			 funding the activities for the period needed to attain meaningful numbers or a
			 critical mass of teachers who are individuals from underrepresented groups,
			 sufficient to address the low employment of teachers from such groups, and
			 offering the activities for other teachers as well; and
:(3) to remedy the
			 historically low employment among teachers in public elementary schools and
			 secondary schools who are individuals from underrepresented groups.

Title II of the
