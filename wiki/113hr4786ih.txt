[[w:Joe Garcia|Mr. Garcia]]introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]] }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to award grants to establish STEM Innovation Networks.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Innovative STEM Networks Act   ”or the“   I-STEM Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) According to the Council on Foreign Relations, 60 percent of U.S. employers are having difficulties finding qualified workers to fill vacancies at their companies.
:(2)   [[w:Office of Science and Technology Policy|Office of Science and Technology and Policy]]states that“STEM occupations will grow 1.7 times faster than non-STEM occupations over the period from 2008 through 2018”.
:(3) According to the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, at all levels of educational attainment, STEM job holders earn 11 percent higher wages compared with their same-degree counterparts in other jobs.
:(4) The National Governors Association Center for Best Practices also states that“The top 10 bachelor-degree majors with the highest median earnings are all in STEM fields”.
:(5) According to the Harris STEM Survey, although most parents of K–12 students (93 percent) believe that STEM education should be a priority in the U.S., only half (49 percent) agreed that it actually is a top priority for this country.
:(6) The Harris STEM Survey also states that“Only one in five STEM college students felt that their K–12 education prepared them extremely well for their college courses in STEM.”. 

=Sec. 3. STEM Innovation Networks=

   Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6601 20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.] )is amended by adding at the end the following new part:

<blockquote> 

==E STEM Innovation Networks– ==



==Sec. 2501. Purpose==

It is the purpose of this part to authorize a program to provide competitive grants to State educational agencies or local educational agencies to establish STEM innovation networks in partnership with institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, other public agencies, or businesses to increase the number of students who are effectively prepared for postsecondary education and careers in STEM fields by—
:(1) working with States and local educational agencies to develop comprehensive plans for identifying, developing, testing, and implementing evidence-based practices to provide rich STEM learning opportunities for students; and
:(2) supporting the implementation of such plans by employing of wide range of strategies, depending on local needs, including the recruitment, preparation, and professional development of effective STEM educators, the development and testing of teaching and learning models that enable students to successfully meet STEM-focused State academic standards developed under section 1111 , and student engagement in STEM subjects.

==Sec. 2502. Grant program==



===(a) In general– ===

From the amounts appropriated under subsection (i) , the [[w:|Secretary]]shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible entities to establish STEM Innovation networks to increase student achievement in STEM subjects and increase the number of students who are effectively prepared for postsecondary education and careers in STEM fields.

===(b) Number of grants– ===

The [[w:|Secretary]]shall award not less than 5 and not more than 10 grants under this section for each fiscal year.

===(c) Priority– ===

In awarding grants under this section, the [[w:|Secretary]]shall give priority to eligible entities that include a high-need local educational agency or a State educational agency that serves a high-need local educational agency.

An application submitted by an eligible entity under paragraph (1) shall include a description of the activities that will be carried out with the grant received under this section, and how such activities will address the needs identified by the eligible entity, with respect to preparing students for postsecondary education and careers in STEM fields, including—
:(A) a description of the data for elementary schools and secondary schools in the State or States served by the eligible entity on—
::(i) student achievement in the STEM subjects;
::(ii) teacher evaluation results or ratings in STEM subjects; and
::(iii) student access to STEM subjects, especially for students enrolled in high-need schools or residing in high-need communities;
:(B) a review of the workforce needs in the State or States served by the eligible entity in occupations and sectors that require knowledge or training in STEM subjects;
:(C) based on a review of the data described in subparagraph (A) and the workforce needs under subparagraph (B) —
::(i) an identification of the STEM subjects that the eligible entity will address with the grant funds; and
::(ii) a description of the activities the eligible entity will carry out to improve instruction in such STEM subjects using evidence-based programs of instruction that are aligned with State academic standards and assessments developed under section 1111 ;
:(D) a description of how the activities carried out with the grant funds will integrate with informal STEM programs;
:(E) results from an analysis carried out before the submission of such application by the eligible entity or a member of the eligible entity of STEM subject education quality and outcomes in the State or States served by the eligible entity, if available;
:(F) whether the eligible entity will provide matching funds from private sources (which are not Federal, State, or local sources) to carry out the activities under subsection (e) ; and
:(G) a description of how the activities carried out with the grant funds will be coordinated with other Federal, State, and local programs and activities relating to STEM, and how the activities carried out with the grant funds may improve or benefit such other programs and activities.
