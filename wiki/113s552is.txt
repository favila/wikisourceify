{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Department of Energy Organization Act to replace the current requirement for a biennial energy policy plan with a Quadrennial Energy Review, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2013”.

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommends that the United States develop a Government wide Federal energy policy and update the policy regularly with strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews similar to the reviews conducted by the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] ;
:(2) as the lead agency in support of energy science and technology innovation, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] has conducted a Quadrennial Technology Review of the energy technology policies and programs of the Department;
:(3) the Quadrennial Technology Review of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] serves as the basis for coordination with other agencies and on other programs for which the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] has a key role;
:(4) a Quadrennial Energy Review would—
::(A) establish integrated, Government wide national energy objectives in the context of economic, environmental, and security priorities;
::(B) coordinate actions across Federal agencies;
::(C) identify the resources needed for the invention, adoption, and diffusion of energy technologies; and
::(D) provide a strong analytical base for Federal energy policy decisions;
:(5) a Quadrennial Energy Review should be established taking into account estimated Federal budgetary resources;
:(6) the development of an energy policy resulting from a Quadrennial Energy Review would—
::(A) enhance the energy security of the United States;
::(B) create jobs; and
::(C) mitigate environmental harm; and
:(7) while a Quadrennial Energy Review will be a product of the executive branch, the review will have substantial input from—
::(A)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] ;
::(B) the energy industry;
::(C) academia;
::(D) nongovernmental organizations; and
::(E) the public.
