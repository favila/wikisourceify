{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 to provide guidance and limitations regarding the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into United States airspace, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H62633EFE777C412A86B0DD8CD9DF2A38}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H085B5A112F2F494F9F5657936386402C}}Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) On February 14, 2012, President Obama signed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012([[Public Law -|Public Law 112–95]] ;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40101 49 U.S.C. 40101 note] )into law, and sections 331 through 336 of such Act require the Federal Aviation Administration to fully integrate government, commercial, and recreational unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones , into United States airspace by October 2015.
:(2) Unmanned aircraft systems have traditionally been used almost exclusively overseas by military and security organizations; however, State and local governments, businesses, and private individuals are increasingly using unmanned aircraft systems in the United States, including deployments for law enforcement operations.
:(3) As the technology advances and the cost decreases—unmanned aircraft systems are already orders of magnitude less expensive to purchase and operate than piloted aircraft—the market for Federal, State, and local government and commercial unmanned aircraft systems is rapidly growing.
:(4) It has been estimated there could be as many as 30,000 unmanned aircraft systems in the sky in the United States by 2020.
:(5) There will no doubt be many beneficial applications of this technology, for as Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood said in a statement on March 7, 2012,“Unmanned aircraft can help us meet a number of challenges, from spotting wildfires to assessing natural disasters.”.
:(6) However, there also is the potential for unmanned aircraft system technology to enable in­va­sive and pervasive surveillance without adequate privacy protections, and currently, no explicit privacy protections or public transparency measures with respect to such system technology are built into the law.
:(7) Federal standards for informing the public and protecting individual privacy with respect to unmanned aircraft systems are needed.
