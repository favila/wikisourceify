{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Jersey and honoring the valuable contributions of people of the Garden State.    Whereas in 1664, the parcel of land between the Delaware and Hudson Rivers came under the control of the English, who named the land New Jersey;   Whereas New Jersey played an instrumental role in the colonies’ success during the American Revolutionary War, serving as the location of more military engagements than any other colony during the war, including two pivotal colonial victories at Trenton and Princeton in the winter of 1776;   Whereas in 1789, New Jersey became the first State in the United States to ratify the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution;   Whereas men and women of New Jersey, such as Thomas Mundy Peterson, Alice Paul, and Paul Robeson, bravely challenged the Nation to recognize and support equal and just rights of citizenship for all people in the United States;   Whereas New Jersey has been a veritable cauldron of culture, contributing iconic and talented artists in literature, film, theater, dance, music, and visual arts;   Whereas world renowned scientists and scholars, including Thomas Alva Edison and Albert Einstein, conducted their research and launched their discoveries in laboratories and institutions throughout the State, resulting in New Jersey serving as a birthplace for inventions and innovations that fundamentally change the way humans interact with each other and the world around them;   Whereas New Jersey has been a leader in developing and engineering formative infrastructure and transportation accomplishments, from the Morris, and Delaware and Raritan Canals to the iconic Garden State Parkway, as well as the now ubiquitous“Jersey Barriers”that provide for the safety of drivers and passengers on roads throughout the country;   Whereas in 1954, the New Jersey State Legislature passed legislation for the State to officially adopt the nickname of the“Garden State”, a proud acknowledgment of the State’s strong agricultural heritage and reflection of the continued abundance of blueberries, cranberries, peaches, and other produce that contribute to New Jersey’s robust agricultural industry;   Whereas the people of New Jersey take pride in enjoying and preserving the State’s vast natural resources, including the 130 miles of sandy beaches along“the shore”, as well as the 1,100,000 acres of Pine Barrens that constitute the Nation’s first National Reserve; and   Whereas it is fitting and desirable that the people of New Jersey and the United States celebrate the current and historic role of New Jersey in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
