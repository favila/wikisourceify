To repeal certain impediments to the administration of the firearms laws.

={{anchor|H1D69FF5D2443448F80B6E860CC6EF531}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Tiahrt Restrictions Repeal Act”.

={{anchor|HA85DB95A88F543E38E79F0A9B7167B46}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) The Tiahrt Amendments severely limit the authority of the [[w:Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (BATFE) to disclose crime gun trace data to the public.
:(2) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collection of valuable information, and the establishment of effective policies to prevent illegal guns.
:(3) Having effective policies to prevent illegal gun trafficking makes our families and communities safer.
:(4) The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and by barring the government from requiring annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops
:(5) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts and give the public vital information needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal guns.
