To improve and enhance research and programs on childhood cancer survivorship, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) An estimated 13,500 children and adolescents under age 20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.
:(2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer survived more than 5 years, but by 2011, cure rates have increased to 78 percent for children and adolescents under age 20.
:(3) As of June 2013, there are more than 360,000 childhood cancer survivors living in the United States.
:(4) As many as2/3of childhood cancer survivors are likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, with as many as1/4experiencing a late effect that is serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and secondary malignancies.
:(5) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as treatments evolve, which means that the monitoring and treatment of cancer survivors may need to be modified on a routine basis.
:(6) The Institute of Medicine, in its report on cancer survivorship entitled Childhood Cancer Survivorship: Improving Care and Quality of Life , states that an organized system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer survivors is needed.
