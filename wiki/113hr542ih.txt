Consistent with the Act of June 4, 1897( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/551 16 U.S.C. 551] ), the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] may not restrict the use of dogs in deer hunting activities in Kisatchie National Forest, unless such restrictions—

Any restrictions regarding the use of dogs in deer hunting activities in Kisatchie National Forest in force on the date of the enactment of this Act shall be void and have no force or effect.

Landowners whose property abuts a unit of the Kisatchie National Forest may petition the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] to restrict the use of dogs in deer hunting activities that take place on such units which abut their property. If the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] receives a petition from an adjacent landowner, the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary]] , after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may impose restrictions on the use of dogs in deer hunting—
