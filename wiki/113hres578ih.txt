{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of the week of May 11, 2014, through May 17, 2014, as“National Police Week”.    Whereas in 1962, John Fitzgerald Kennedy proclaimed May 15 to be“Peace Officers Memorial Day”, and designated the calendar week in which May 15 falls as“National Police Week”;   Whereas law enforcement officers are charged with pursuing justice and protecting communities in the United States;   Whereas State and local police officers, sheriffs, and other law enforcement officers across the United States serve with dignity and integrity;   Whereas law enforcement officers serve as first responders to natural disasters such as Hurricane Isaac and Hurricane Sandy;   Whereas law enforcement officers serve as first responders to terrorist attacks such as the bombings at the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts, and to accidents such as the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas;   Whereas the deadliest day in law enforcement history was September 11, 2001, when 72 officers were killed while responding to the terrorist attacks on the United States;   Whereas law enforcement officers selflessly risk their personal safety in the interest of public safety; and   Whereas“Peace Officers Memorial Day”honors law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty: Now, therefore, be it
