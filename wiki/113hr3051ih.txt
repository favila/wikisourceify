{{Center|A BILL}}

To extend State jurisdiction over submerged lands and to allow States to grant oil and natural gas leases in the extended area.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Coastal States Extension Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) In Executive Proclamation 5928, issued on December 27, 1988, the President extended the boundaries of the territorial sea of the United States from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles in accordance with international law. However, the Proclamation did not adequately address the effect of the extension on the territorial jurisdiction of the States.
:(2) The coastal States have, with few exceptions, jurisdiction over the land, air, water, and resources within their boundaries, which in most cases extend out into the oceans 3 nautical miles.
:(3) The Great Lake States have jurisdiction over the land, air, water, and resources of their offshore areas up to the border with Canada, which can range from 11 to 80 nautical miles from the coast line.
:(4) Some Gulf of Mexico States have jurisdiction over the land, air, water, and resources of their offshore areas out to 10.4 nautical miles from their coast line.
:(5) The coastal States—
::(A) have consistently demonstrated an ability to manage ocean resources within their jurisdiction in a manner consistent with the interests of both the Nation and the coastal States;
::(B) have demonstrated both experience and skill at balancing protection, conservation, and utilization of the living and nonliving resources of the ocean; and
::(C) are better equipped than the Federal Government, in terms of fiscal resources and administrative abilities, to manage oil and natural gas resources within 12 nautical miles of their coast line.
