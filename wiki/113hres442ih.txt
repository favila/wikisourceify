Directing the House of Representatives to bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge certain policies and actions taken by the executive branch.Whereas
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]] and officials in his administration have frequently overstepped the limits placed on executive branch power by the Constitution;Whereas because of
