      Findings
      
        
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             makes the following
			 findings:
			
        (1)
        President Franklin
			 Delano Roosevelt issued an order commissioning around 250,000 troops from the
			 Philippines into active service for the United States during World War
			 II.
			
      
        (2)
        The United States
			 War Department immediately formed the United States Armed Forces in the Far
			 East (USAFFE). The unit was made up of the United States-Philippine Military
			 Forces of the Commonwealth Army, Guerrilla Units, New Philippine Scout.
			
      
        (3)
        The Filipino
			 Infantry Regiment, was mostly composed of first-generation immigrants living
			 along the Pacific Coast, who volunteered after the Japanese attack on Pearl
			 Harbor in 1941, later many second-generation Filipino-American soldiers joined
			 the Regiment from Hawaii.
			
      
        (4)
        The Philippine
			 Scout units and the New Philippine Scouts were directly recruited by the United
			 States Army for the war effort.
			
      
        (5)
        Under extremely
			 severe occupation policies imposed by the Japanese, it was the anti-Japanese
			 resistance movement that drew more and more Filipinos to its side and through
			 1943 many of these anti-Japanese guerrillas recovered or newly established
			 liaisons with the United States Army Command of the Southwest Pacific Area and
			 placed themselves under the command of General Douglas MacArthur.
			
      
        (6)
        These Filipino
			 soldiers responded to President Roosevelt’s call-to-arms and later fought under
			 the American flag during World War II.
			
      
        (7)
        After the Japanese
			 invasion in December 1941, Filipino and American troops literally shared the
			 same fate at Bataan, Corregidor, and the Death March.
			
      
        (8)
        Many made the
			 ultimate sacrifice as both soldiers in the United States Armed Forces in the
			 Far East and as guerilla fighters during the Imperial Japanese occupation of
			 the Philippines.
			
      
        (9)
        These troops had
			 served under the expectation that they would be treated as United States
			 military servicemembers.
			
      
        (10)
        The Rescission
			 Act of 1946 later passed, which stated that Filipino forces would not be deemed
			 to have been active military.
			
      
        (11)
        Congress
			 recognizes the courage and bravery of the Filipino and Filipino American
			 servicemen and servicewomen who have fought alongside and in the United States
			 Armed Forces.
			
      
        (12)
        The United States
			 remains forever indebted to the bravery, valor, and dedication to country these
			 men displayed.
			
      
        (13)
        Their commitment
			 and sacrifice demonstrates a highly uncommon and commendable sense of
			 patriotism and honor.
