:(2) A set of critical infrastructure security technology needs that—
::(A) is prioritized based on risk and gaps identified under paragraph (1) ;
::(B) emphasizes research and development of those technologies that need to be accelerated due to rapidly evolving threats or rapidly advancing infrastructure technology; and
::(C) includes research, development, and acquisition roadmaps with clearly defined objectives, goals, and measures.
:(3) An identification of laboratories, facilities, modeling, and simulation capabilities that will be required to support the research, development, demonstration, testing, evaluation, and acquisition of the security technologies described in paragraph (2) .
:(4) An identification of current and planned programmatic initiatives for fostering the rapid advancement and deployment of security technologies for critical infrastructure protection. The initiatives shall consider opportunities for public-private partnerships, intragovernment collaboration, university centers of excellence, and national laboratory technology transfer.

===(c) Coordination– ===

In carrying out this section, the [[w:Under Secretary for Science and Technology|Under Secretary for Science and Technology]] shall coordinate with the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Under Secretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate]] .
