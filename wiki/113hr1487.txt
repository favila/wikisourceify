=={{anchor|H965A3AF93F204B049BBBC4F7A791FFDD}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] has been engaged in approving, on a project-by-project basis, gain-sharing arrangements under demonstration authority for nearly a decade. Based on the knowledge gained from such demonstration projects, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department]] is capable of developing and applying standards for permitting such arrangements more generally without the use of such authority.
:(2) The [[w:|Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services]] has issued a special advisory bulletin in July 1999 that indicates that there is no general authority for waiving sanctions for any gain-sharing arrangements between physicians and hospitals.
:(3) Due to lack of capitalization, size limitations, risk characteristics, and other factors, many hospitals and physicians have been unable or unwilling to enter into gain-sharing types of arrangements that meet the requirements of the shared savings program.

The purpose of this section is to establish general statutory authority within the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] to recognize gain-sharing and other incentive payment programs, other than the shared savings program, that align incentives among hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality care.
