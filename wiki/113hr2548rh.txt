{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish a comprehensive United States Government policy to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa to develop an appropriate mix of power solutions for more broadly distributed electricity access in order to support poverty alleviation and drive economic growth, and for other purposes.    

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Electrify Africa Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to encourage the efforts of countries in sub-Saharan Africa to improve access to affordable and reliable electricity in Africa in order to unlock the potential for economic growth, job creation, food security, improved health, education and environmental outcomes, and poverty reduction. 

=Sec. 3. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) 589,000,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, or 68 percent of the population, did not have access to electricity, as of 2010;
:(2) in sub-Saharan Africa, electricity services are highly unreliable and they are at least twice as expensive for those with electricity access compared to other emerging markets;
:(3) lack of access to electricity services disproportionally affects women and girls, who often shoulder the burden of seeking sources of heat and light such as dung, wood or charcoal and are often more exposed to the associated negative health impacts. Women and girls also face an increased risk of assault from walking long distances to gather fuel sources;
:(4) access to electricity creates opportunities, including entrepreneurship, for people to work their way out of poverty;
:(5) a lack of electricity contributes to the high use of inefficient and often highly polluting fuel sources for indoor cooking, heating, and lighting that produce toxic fumes resulting in more than 3,000,000 annual premature deaths from respiratory disease, more annual deaths than from HIV/AIDS and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa;
:(6) electricity access is crucial for the cold storage of vaccines and anti-retroviral and other lifesaving medical drugs, as well as the operation of modern lifesaving medical equipment;
:(7) electricity access can be used to improve food security by enabling post-harvest processing, pumping, irrigation, dry grain storage, milling, refrigeration, and other uses;
:(8) reliable electricity access can provide improved lighting options and information and communication technologies, including Internet access and mobile phone charging, that can greatly improve health, social, and education outcomes, as well as economic and commercial possibilities;
:(9) sub-Saharan Africa’s consumer base of nearly one billion people is rapidly growing and will create increasing demand for United States goods, services, and technologies, but the current electricity deficit in sub-Saharan Africa limits this demand by restricting economic growth on the continent;
:(10) approximately 30 African countries face endemic power shortages, and nearly 70 percent of surveyed African businesses cite unreliable power as a major constraint to growth;
:(11) the [[w:|Millennium Challenge Corporation]]’s work in the energy sector shows high projected economic rates of return that translate to sustainable economic growth and that the highest returns are projected when infrastructure improvements are coupled with significant legislative, regulatory, institutional, and policy reforms;
:(12) in many countries, weak governance capacity, regulatory bottlenecks, legal constraints, and lack of transparency and accountability can stifle the ability of private investment to assist in the generation and distribution of electricity; and
:(13) without new policies and more effective investments in electricity sector capacity to increase and expand electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa, over 70 percent of the rural population, and 48 percent of the total population, will potentially remain without access to electricity by 2030. 

=Sec. 4. Statement of policy=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]declares that it is the policy of the United States—
:(1) in consultation with sub-Saharan African governments, to encourage the private sector, international community, African Regional Economic Communities, philanthropies, civil society, and other governments to promote—
::(A) the installation of at least an additional 20,000 megawatts of electrical power in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 to support poverty reduction, promote development outcomes, and drive economic growth;
::(B) first-time direct access to electricity for at least 50,000,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 in both urban and rural areas;
::(C) efficient institutional platforms with accountable governance to provide electrical service to rural and underserved areas; and
::(D) the necessary in-country legislative, regulatory and policy reforms to make such expansion of electricity access possible; and
:(2) to encourage private sector and international support for construction of hydroelectric dams in sub-Saharan Africa that—
::(A) offer low-cost clean energy consistent with—
:::(i) the national security interests of the United States; and
:::(ii) best international practices regarding social and environmental safeguards, including—
::::(I) engagement of local communities regarding the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of such projects;
::::(II) the consideration of energy alternatives, including distributed renewable energy; and
::::(III) the development of appropriate mitigation measures; and
::(B) support partner country efforts.
