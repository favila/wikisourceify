{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of Congress that all direct and indirect subsidies that benefit the production or export of sugar by all major sugar producing and consuming countries should be eliminated.    Whereas every major sugar-producing and sugar-consuming country in the world maintains some form of direct or indirect subsidy to support its sugar growers, processors, or consumers;   Whereas virtually all of the more than 100 countries that produce sugar maintain market distorting subsidy programs, including— 
:(1) the Government of Brazil which has direct and indirect subsidies of at least $2,500,000,000 per year for programs to promote its sugar and ethanol industry and a subsidized credit program making available over $2,000,000,000 to growers to replant sugarcane; and 
:(2) the Government of Mexico which has direct and indirect subsidies to keep open 9 government-owned sugar mills accounting for 22 percent of Mexican sugar production and direct payments to sugarcane growers;   Whereas the world sugar market is the most volatile commodity market in the world;   Whereas the foregoing clauses provide ample evidence there is no undistorted, free market in sugar in the world today; and   Whereas if such a free market did exist, United States sugar farmers and processors could compete effectively in that market: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That it is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]], by agreements negotiated under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, should seek elimination of all direct and indirect subsidies benefitting the production or export of sugar by the government of—
::(A) each country that exported more than 200,000 metric tons of sugar during 2013; and
::(B) any other country with which the United States has in effect a free trade agreement;
:(2) if the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]determines that all such subsidies by all such countries have been eliminated, then the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]should report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]detailed information about how each of the countries has eliminated such subsidies; and
:(3) after submitting such report, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]should propose to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]legislation to implement a“zero for zero”sugar subsidy policy.
