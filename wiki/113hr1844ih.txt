{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 9 of the United States Code with respect to arbitration.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Arbitration Fairness Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The  Federal Arbitration Act (now enacted as chapter 1of title 9 of the United States Code)was intended to apply to disputes between commercial entities of generally similar sophistication and bargaining power.
:(2) A series of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States have interpreted the Act so that it now extends to consumer disputes and employment disputes, contrary to the intent of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]].
:(3) Most consumers and employees have little or no meaningful choice whether to submit their claims to arbitration. Often, consumers and employees are not even aware that they have given up their rights.
:(4) Mandatory arbitration undermines the development of public law because there is inadequate transparency and inadequate judicial review of arbitrators' decisions.
:(5) Arbitration can be an acceptable alternative when consent to the arbitration is truly voluntary, and occurs after the dispute arises. 

=Sec. 3. Arbitration of employment, consumer, antitrust, and civil rights disputes=

====(b) Applicability– ====



=====(1) In general– =====

An issue as to whether this chapter applies to an arbitration agreement shall be determined under Federal law. The applicability of this chapter to an agreement to arbitrate and the validity and enforceability of an agreement to which this chapter applies shall be determined by a court, rather than an arbitrator, irrespective of whether the party resisting arbitration challenges the arbitration agreement specifically or in conjunction with other terms of the contract containing such agreement.

=====(2) Collective bargaining agreements– =====

Nothing in this chapter shall apply to any arbitration provision in a contract between an employer and a labor organization or between labor organizations, except that no such arbitration provision shall have the effect of waiving the right of an employee to seek judicial enforcement of a right arising under a provision of the Constitution of the United States, a State constitution, or a Federal or State statute, or public policy arising therefrom. .
