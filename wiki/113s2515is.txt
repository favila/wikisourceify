 To ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have the opportunity to receive care in a home and community-based setting.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Community Integration Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), held that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities is a violation of the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12101 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.] ).
:(2) Under Olmstead, individuals generally have the right to receive their supports and services in home and community-based settings, rather than in institutional settings, if they so choose.
:(3) Olmstead envisioned that States would provide appropriate long-term services and supports to individuals with disabilities through home and community-based services and end forced segregation in nursing homes and other institutions.
:(4) While there has been progress in rebalancing State spending on individuals with disabilities in institutions as compared to home and community-based settings, more than 75 percent of States continue to spend the majority of their long-term care dollars on nursing homes and other institutional settings, and the number of individuals with disabilities under age 65 in nursing homes increased between 2008 and 2012.
:(5) As of June 2013, there were more than 200,000 individuals younger than age 65 in nursing homes—almost 16 percent of the total nursing home population.
:(6) Thirty-eight studies published from 2005 to 2012 concluded that providing services in home and community-based settings is less costly than providing care in a nursing home or other institutional setting.
:(7) No clear or centralized reporting system exists to compare how effectively States are meeting the Olmstead mandate. 

=Sec. 3. Ensuring Medicaid beneficiaries may elect to receive care in a home and community-based setting=
