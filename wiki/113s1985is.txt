{{Center|A BILL}}

 To reauthorize and modify the pilot program of the Department of Veterans Affairs under which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs provides health services to veterans through qualifying non-Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Veterans Health Care Access Received Closer to Home Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) veterans who are authorized by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] to receive health care in the community must not lose the high quality, safety, care coordination, and other veteran-centric elements that the health care system of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] provides;
:(2) many veterans receive health care from both the Department and community providers but the lack of care coordination among the Department and community providers when veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite health care resources;
:(3) veteran-centric care coordination is associated with improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the best care for veterans; and
:(4) if the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] purchases care for veterans from the private sector, such care must be secured in a cost-effective manner, in a way that complements the larger health care system of the Department by using industry standards for care and costs. 

=Sec. 3. Reauthorization and modification of pilot program of enhanced contract care authority for health care needs of veterans=

   Section 403 of the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 ([[Public Law 110-387|Public Law 110–387]] ;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1703  38 U.S.C. 1703note])is amended—
