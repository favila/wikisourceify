={{anchor|HE445B04FB439408A8B17F3C282001BF5}}Sec. 2. Congressional findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the United States needs to take actions to be better prepared for and better protected from catastrophes;
:(2) the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 are startling reminders of both the human and economic devastation that hurricanes, flooding, and other natural disasters can cause;
:(3) if a hurricane similar to the deadly 1900 Galveston hurricane occurred again it could cause over $36,000,000,000 in loss;
:(4) if the 1904 San Francisco earthquake occurred again it could cause over $400,000,000,000 in loss;
:(5) if a Category 5 hurricane were to hit Miami it could cause over $50,000,000,000 in loss and devastate the insurance industry in the United States;
:(6) if the 1938“Long Island Express”were to occur again it could cause over $30,000,000,000 in damage and if a hurricane that strong were to directly hit Manhattan it could cause over $150,000,000,000 in damage and cause irreparable harm to our Nation’s economy;
:(7) a more comprehensive and integrated approach to dealing with catastrophes is needed;
:(8) using history as a guide, natural catastrophes will inevitably place a tremendous strain on homeowners’ insurance markets in many areas, will raise costs for consumers, and will jeopardize the ability of many consumers to adequately insure their homes and possessions;
:(9) the lack of sufficient insurance capacity and the inability of private insurers to build enough capital, in a short amount of time, threatens to increase the number of uninsured homeowners, which, in turn, increases the risk of mortgage defaults and the strain on the Nation’s banking system;
:(10) some States have intervened to ensure the continued availability and affordability of homeowners’ insurance for all residents;
:(11) it is appropriate that efforts to improve insurance availability be designed and implemented at the State level;
:(12) while State insurance programs may be adequate to cover losses from most natural disasters, a small percentage of events are likely to exceed the financial capacity of these programs and the local insurance markets;
:(13) making available limited Federal reinsurance would improve the effectiveness of State insurance programs and private insurance markets and would increase the likelihood that homeowners’ insurance claims will be fully paid in the event of a large natural catastrophe and that routine claims that occur after a mega-catastrophe will also continue to be paid;
:(14) it is necessary to provide a Federal reinsurance program on a temporary basis that will provide more protection at an overall lower cost and that will promote stability in the homeowners’ insurance market in the short term and encourage growth of reinsurance capacity by the private and capital markets as soon as practical;
:(15) it is the proper role of the Federal Government to prepare for and protect its citizens from catastrophes and to facilitate consumer protection, victim assistance, and recovery, including financial recovery;
:(16) any Federal reinsurance program must be founded upon sound actuarial principles and priced in a manner that minimizes the potential impact on the Treasury of the United States, encourages the creation of State funds and maximizes the buying potential of these State funds, encourages and promotes prevention and mitigation, recovery and rebuilding, and consumer education, and emphasizes continuous analysis and improvement; and
:(17) such a Federal reinsurance program should not remain in existence longer than necessary for the private entities or the capital markets, or both, to provide adequate reinsurance capacity to address the homeowners’ insurance market.
