:(3) accelerate the development of best practices and make reforming solitary confinement a top priority in each prison, jail, and juvenile detention system at the Federal and State levels;
:(4) increase the available data and information on the incidence of solitary confinement, consequently improving the management and administration of correctional and juvenile justice facilities;
:(5) standardize the definitions used for collecting data on the incidence of solitary confinement;
:(6) increase the accountability of prison, jail, and juvenile corrections officials who fail to design and implement humane and constitutionally sound solitary confinement practices;

===(2) Matters included– ===

The information provided under paragraph (1) shall include recommended national standards relating to—
:(A) how authorities can progress toward significantly limiting the utilization of solitary confinement so that a prisoner or detainee may be placed in solitary confinement only when the safety or security of the facility or another person is at imminent risk, during an ongoing disciplinary investigation concerning an adult prisoner, or to punish an adult prisoner for an extremely serious disciplinary infraction;
:(B) methods that can be employed to ensure that the duration of solitary confinement of a prisoner at an institution can be limited to fewer than 30 days in any 45-day period, except in a case in which the head of a corrections facility makes an individualized determination that prolonged solitary confinement of the prisoner for a serious disciplinary infraction is necessary for the order or security of the institution or a prisoner requests such placement;
:(C) ensuring that prior to being classified, assigned, or subject to long-term solitary confinement, an adult prisoner shall be entitled to a meaningful hearing on the reason for and duration of the confinement and have access to legal counsel for such hearings;
:(D) ensuring that indefinite sentencing of an adult prisoner to long-term solitary confinement will not be allowed and that the prisoner will be afforded a meaningful review of the confinement at least once every 30 days that the prisoner remains in solitary confinement and that facility officials must record and provide a transcript of the review proceedings for the prisoner under review to the prisoner or the prisoner’s designee;
:(E) ensuring that corrections authorities design and implement programming that allows adult prisoners subject to long-term solitary confinement to earn placement in less restrictive housing through positive behavior;
:(F) limiting the use of involuntary solitary confinement for the purpose of protective custody solely because of a personal characteristic that makes the prisoner particularly vulnerable to harm, including age, gender identity, race, or religion;
:(G) ensuring that corrections authorities improve access to mental health treatment for prisoners and juvenile detainees in solitary confinement;
:(H) ensuring that corrections authorities work toward systems wherein prisoners and juvenile detainees diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional with a serious mental illness shall not be held in long-term solitary confinement;
:(I) ensuring that corrections authorities do all that is feasible to make certain that prisoners and juvenile detainees younger than 18 years of age shall not be held in solitary confinement for any duration, except under extreme emergency circumstances;
