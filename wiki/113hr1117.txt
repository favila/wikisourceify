Findings

          [[United States Congress|Congress]]

The Government has a compelling interest in

The presence of
			 foreign individuals or associations within domestic associations, to any
			 degree, creates an unacceptable risk of foreign influence over our Nation's
			 political process.

The law does not
			 allow foreign individuals and associations to vote in our elections; by the
			 same token, the law should not allow them to exercise any influence over our
			 Nation's political process, directly or indirectly, and neither personally nor
			 in alliance or combination with others.
