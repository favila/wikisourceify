{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the benefits and importance of music making as an essential form of creative expression and expressing support for designating the Summer Solstice, June 21, 2014, as Make Music Day.    Whereas the Summer Solstice, June 21, is the first day of summer and an appropriate day to annually celebrate the myriad of joys and benefits of making music;   Whereas this event began over 30 years ago in France as Fête de la Musique, and observations of Make Music Day now take place internationally in 800 cities in 110 countries around the world;   Whereas these celebrations have become a global phenomenon involving millions of musicians of all styles and skill levels, performing publicly;   Whereas making music continues to demonstrate the power of music as providing enjoyment, building cultural connections, raising social awareness, celebrating history, and examining the whole of the human experience;   Whereas making music inspires people of all abilities, persuasions, and ethnicities to come together to“just play”;   Whereas making music is an integral part of United States culture and a chronicle of the Nation's struggles and triumphs;   Whereas making music advances learning, enhances the overall educational experience, and contributes to a complete education;   Whereas making music is shown to benefit the well-being of people throughout their lives, and that making music contributes to a fuller, more satisfying life; and   Whereas Make Music Day will come to life throughout the United States with thousands of events on June 21, 2014, when musicians of all ages and abilities will perform on streets, sidewalks, stoops, plazas, parks, in group lessons, solo performances, instrument circles, musical parades, and mass appeal events open to all: Now, therefore, be it
