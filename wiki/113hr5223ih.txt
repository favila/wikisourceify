{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants to States for the purpose of assisting the States in operating an RDOCS program in order to provide for the increased availability of primary health care services in health professional shortage areas.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Restoring the Doctors of Our Country through Scholarships Act of 2014   ”or the“   RDOCS Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds the following:
:(1) Due to an aging population, the retirement of a generation of physicians, and 30,000,000 newly insured under the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ([[Public Law 110-148|Public Law 110–148]] ), the United States is expected to experience an acute physician workforce shortage in the coming decades, particularly in primary care. If unaddressed, this shortage will compromise the health of the population as well as the ability of the United States to remain competitive in the world.
:(2) By 2020, the shortage of primary care doctors is expected to reach 45,000.
:(3) The shortage will disproportionately impact rural communities and underserved urban communities.
:(4) The Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) model of education and training is a respected and effective way of meeting the Nation’s need for educated and trained officers in the United States Armed Forces, and can be applied to solving the Nation’s primary care shortage.
:(5) There are 10 applicants for each National Health Service Corps scholarship awarded, indicating the unmet demand for medical scholarships. 

=Sec. 3. Grants to States for Restoring the Doctors of Our Country through Scholarships (RDOCS) programs=

   Subpart III of part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/254l 42 U.S.C. 254l et seq.] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>
