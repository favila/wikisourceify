For purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall apply:

==(a) Residential mortgage loan– ==

The term residential mortgage loan means any consumer credit transaction that is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust, or other equivalent consensual security interest on a dwelling or on residential real property that includes a dwelling, other than a consumer credit transaction under an open end credit plan or an extension of credit relating to a plan described in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/101 section 101(53D) of title 11, United States Code] .

The term securitization vehicle means a trust, special purpose entity, or other legal structure that is used to facilitate the issuing of securities, participation certificates, or similar instruments backed by or referring to a pool of assets that includes residential mortgage loans (or instruments that are related to residential mortgage loans, such as credit-linked notes).

==(c) Servicer– ==

The term servicer has the same meaning as in section 129A of the Truth in Lending Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1639a 15 U.S.C. 1639a] ), except that such term includes a person who makes or holds a residential mortgage loan (including a pool of residential mortgage loans), if such person also services the loan.

==(d) Short sale– ==

The term short sale means the sale of the dwelling or residential real property that is subject to the mortgage, deed or trust, or other security interest that secures a residential mortgage loan that—
:(1) will result in proceeds in an amount that is less than the remaining amount due under the mortgage loan; and
:(2) requires authorization by the securitization vehicle or other investment vehicle or holder of the mortgage loan, or the servicer acting on behalf of such a vehicle or holder.

:(iii) a definitive response to such request approving or denying such request, not later than 30 days after the date of such receipt.

====(B) Exceptional circumstances– ====

In any case in which a servicer is unable to provide a decision with respect to a written request of a mortgagor of a residential mortgage loan during the 30-day period required by subparagraph (A), such period may be extended to not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a completed application, except that the servicer shall, verbally or in writing—
:(i) notify the mortgagor during the initial 30-day period that the application is still under review; and
