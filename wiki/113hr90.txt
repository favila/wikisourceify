1. Short title

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds that—
: the incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a serious national problem;: such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of communities and is deeply divisive;: existing Federal law is inadequate to address this problem;: such violence affects interstate commerce in many ways, including—:: by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence; and:: by preventing members of targeted groups from purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining employment or participating in other commercial activity;: perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence;: instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of such violence;: such violence is committed using articles that have traveled in interstate commerce;: violence motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery can constitute badges and incidents of slavery;: although many local jurisdictions have attempted to respond to the challenges posed by such violence, the problem is sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in scope to warrant Federal intervention to assist such jurisdictions; and: many States have no laws addressing violence based on the actual or perceived race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability, of the victim, while other States have laws that provide only limited protection.
