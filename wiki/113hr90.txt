      Findings
      
        
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             finds that—
			
        (1)
        the incidence of
			 violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color, national origin,
			 religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a
			 serious national problem;
			
      
        (2)
        such violence
			 disrupts the tranquility and safety of communities and is deeply
			 divisive;
			
      
        (3)
        existing Federal
			 law is inadequate to address this problem;
			
      
        (4)
        such violence
			 affects interstate commerce in many ways, including—
				
          (A)
          by impeding the
			 movement of members of targeted groups and forcing such members to move across
			 State lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence; and
				
        
          (B)
          by preventing
			 members of targeted groups from purchasing goods and services, obtaining or
			 sustaining employment or participating in other commercial activity;
				
      
      
        (5)
        perpetrators cross
			 State lines to commit such violence;
			
      
        (6)
        instrumentalities
			 of interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of such
			 violence;
			
      
        (7)
        such violence is
			 committed using articles that have traveled in interstate commerce;
			
      
        (8)
        violence motivated
			 by bias that is a relic of slavery can constitute badges and incidents of
			 slavery;
			
      
        (9)
        although many
			 local jurisdictions have attempted to respond to the challenges posed by such
			 violence, the problem is sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in
			 scope to warrant Federal intervention to assist such jurisdictions; and
			
      
        (10)
        many States have
			 no laws addressing violence based on the actual or perceived race, color,
			 national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability, of the
			 victim, while other States have laws that provide only limited
			 protection.

      Definition of
			 hate crime
      In this Act, the
			 term hate crime has the same meaning as in 
          section 280003(a) of
			 the Violent Crime Control and Law
			 Enforcement Act of 1994
           (28 U.S.C. 994 note).
