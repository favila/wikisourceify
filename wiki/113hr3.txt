{{Center|A BILL}}

To approve the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H9E82E7A2FAC04D35918E650CE738D6AF}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Northern Route Approval Act”.

={{anchor|HDD90D2A5A55248ECA280A593585F77E1}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds the following:
:(1) To maintain our Nation’s competitive edge and ensure an economy built to last, the United States must have fast, reliable, resilient, and environmentally sound means of moving energy. In a global economy, we will compete for the world’s investments based in significant part on the quality of our infrastructure. Investing in the Nation’s infrastructure provides immediate and long-term economic benefits for local communities and the Nation as a whole.
:(2) The delivery of oil from Canada, a close ally not only in proximity but in shared values and ideals, to domestic markets is in the national interest because of the need to lessen dependence upon insecure foreign sources.
:(3) The Keystone XL pipeline would provide both short-term and long-term employment opportunities and related labor income benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes.
:(4) The State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will have minimal environmental impacts.
:(5) The Department of State and other Federal agencies have over a long period of time conducted extensive studies and analysis of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.
:(6) The transportation of oil via pipeline is the safest and most economically and environmentally effective means of doing so.
:(7) The Keystone XL is in much the same position today as the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 prior to congressional action. Once again, the Federal regulatory process remains an insurmountable obstacle to a project that is likely to reduce oil imports from insecure foreign sources.

={{anchor|HB280157D3A4D420CB5CEADFA061FB287}}Sec. 3. Keystone XL permit approval=

Notwithstanding Executive Order No. 13337 (3 U.S.C. 301 note), Executive Order No. 11423 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// 3 U.S.C. 301] note), section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and any other Executive order or provision of law, no Presidential permit shall be required for the pipeline described in the application filed on May 4, 2012, by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. to the Department of State for the Keystone XL pipeline, as supplemented to include the Nebraska reroute evaluated in the Final Evaluation Report issued by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality in January 2013 and approved by the Nebraska governor. The final environmental impact statement issued by the Secretary of State on August 26, 2011, coupled with the Final Evaluation Report described in the previous sentence, shall be considered to satisfy all requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and of the National Historic Preservation Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.] ).

:(2) the constitutionality of any provision of this Act, or any decision or action taken, made, granted, or issued, or deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under this Act; or
:(3) the adequacy of any environmental impact statement prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), or of any analysis under any other Act, with respect to any action taken, made, granted, or issued, or deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under this Act.

=={{anchor|HBA24E0569DD74E94870EC754E3FDB62B}}(a) Findings– ==

The Congress finds that—
