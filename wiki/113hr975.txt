This Act may be cited as the
			 “Servicemember Mental Health Review
			 Act”.

={{anchor|H898A4BD8E9A84F40975FCA900D21AC67}}Sec. 2. Findings=


:(1) Since September 11, 2001, approximately
			 30,000 veterans have been separated from the Armed Forces on the basis of a
			 personality disorder or adjustment disorder.
:(2) Nearly all veterans who are separated on
			 the basis of a personality or adjustment disorder are prohibited from accessing
			 service-connected disability compensation, disability severance pay, and
			 disability retirement pay.
:(3) Many veterans who are separated on the
			 basis of a personality or adjustment disorder are unable to find employment
			 because of the personality disorder or adjustment
			 disorder label on their Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active
			 Duty.
:(4) The [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] has
			 found that the regulatory compliance of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] in separating
			 members of the Armed Forces on the basis of a personality or adjustment
			 disorder was as low as 40 percent between 2001 and 2007.
:(5) Expansion of the authority of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Physical
			 Disability Board of Review]] to include review of the separation of members of
			 the Armed Forces on the basis of a mental condition not amounting to
			 disability, including separation on the basis of a personality or adjustment
			 disorder, is warranted in order to ensure that any veteran wrongly separated on
			 such basis will have the ability to access disability benefits and employment
			 opportunities available to veterans.

				covered individual before proceeding with the review.
:(6) After the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Physical Disability Board of
				Review]] has completed the review under this subsection with respect to the
				separation of a covered individual, the board must provide the claimant with a
				statement of reasons concerning the board’s decision. The covered individual

				previously separated with a lump-sum or other payment of back pay and
				allowances at separation, the amount of pay or other monetary benefits to which
