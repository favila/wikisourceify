Not later than 3 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Office of Engineering and Technology of the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]shall issue a public notice seeking comment on proposals for—
:(I) interference-mitigation techniques and technologies, and potential rechannelization, that would accommodate both incumbent licensees, including Dedicated Short Range Communications Services licensees, and widespread commercial unlicensed operations in the 5850–5925 MHz band; and
:(II) deployment timelines for the technologies described in subparagraph (I) .

=====(ii) NTIA response– =====

The [[w:National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]], in response to the public notice issued under clause (i) , shall publicly submit to the Office of Engineering and Technology a description of any current and anticipated further Federal uses of the 5850–5925 MHz band.

====(B) Test plan– ====



=====(i) In general– =====

Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]shall, in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]and the [[w:National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]], develop and publish a test plan, including a timeline, for the use of unlicensed devices in the 5850–5925 MHz band.

=====(ii) Requirement– =====

The test plan developed and published under clause (i) shall be designed to allow the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]to evaluate technologies for allowing unlicensed devices to utilize the 5850–5925 MHz band without causing harmful interference to incumbent licensees, including Dedicated Short Range Communications Services licensees.

=====(iii) Testing multiple methods– =====

The [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]may choose to test multiple methods of sharing the 5850–5925 MHz band.

=====(iv) Considerations– =====

In developing the test plan under clause (i) , the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]shall consider—
:(I) the comments filed in response to the public notice issued under subparagraph (A)(i) ;
:(II) the comments filed in response to ET Docket No. 13–49;
:(III) the functions currently authorized under exclusive allocation that could be performed by unlicensed or shared spectrum;
:(IV) whether a system of priority access could substitute for exclusive licensing and, if so, whether the system of priority access should be confined to—
::(aa) particular portions of the 5850–5925 MHz band; and
::(bb) functions critical for dedicated short-range communications crash avoidance;
:(V) whether non-exclusive licensing or other forms of shared spectrum access could substitute for exclusive licensing;
:(VI) whether the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]could promulgate rules to migrate existing licensees to an alternative band;
:(VII) whether, to protect critical public safety communications, the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]could allow sharing in only a portion of the 5850–5925 MHz spectrum; and
:(VIII) whether shared use or a system of priority access—
::(aa) causes harmful interference to incumbent licensees; or
::(bb) compromises safety-of-life uses by incumbent licensees that are necessary for advancing motor vehicle safety.

====(C) Testing; results– ====

Not later than 15 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]], in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]and the [[w:National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]], shall—
