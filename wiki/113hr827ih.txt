=====(2) Method of payment– =====

To the extent practicable, one-time payments made under this subsection shall be made in the same manner as payments of net equity claims of customers of a debtor are made under the other provisions of this Act.

======(B) Payment amount limited to claims– ======

The amount paid to a customer under this subsection shall be equal to the lesser of—
:(i) the customer’s net equity claim against the debtor; and
:(ii) the cap set under paragraph (3) .

=====(3) Cap on one-time payments– =====

At the time the action is initiated under subsection (b) , SIPC shall set a cap on the amount of one-time payments that can be made under this subsection, and such cap—

:(B) shall apply equally to all customers of the debtor.

=====(4) Effect of election– =====



======(A) No SIPC advance– ======

  Section 9(a) shall not apply with respect to any customer who receives a one-time payment under this subsection.

======(B) Subrogation– ======

With respect to any customer who receives a one-time payment under this subsection, SIPC shall be subrogated to all rights of such customer against the debtor once the customer recovers an amount equal to the customer’s net equity claim against the debtor.

=====(7) Judicial review of certain SIPC determinations– =====

With respect to any person who is not permitted to make an election under this subsection because SIPC does not identify them as a customer of the debtor, such person may commence an action against SIPC in the appropriate United States district court to challenge the determination by SIPC that they are not a customer of the debtor.
