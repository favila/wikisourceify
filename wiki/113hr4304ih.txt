==Sec. 501. Uniform use of cost-benefit analysis==

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553  Section 553of title 5, United States Code], is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 
:(f) 
::(1) Prior to any rulemaking under this section, an agency shall comply with the following:
:::(A) The agency shall identify, in the context of a coherent conceptual framework and supported with objective data—
::::(i) the nature and significance of the market failure, regulatory failure, or other problem that necessitates regulatory action;
::::(ii) the reasons why national economic and income growth, advancing technology, and other market developments will not obviate the need for the rulemaking;
::::(iii) the reasons why regulation at the State, local, or tribal level could not address the problem better than at the Federal level;
::::(iv) the reasons why reducing rather than increasing the extent or stringency of existing Federal regulation would not address the problem better; and
::::(v) the particular authority by which the agency may take action.
:::(B) Before the agency increases the extent or stringency of regulation based on its determinations pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (A)], it shall—
::::(i) set an achievable objective for its regulatory action and identify the metrics by which the agency will measure progress toward the objective;
::::(ii) issue a notice of inquiry seeking public comment on the identification of a new objective under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (i)]; and
::::(iii) give notice to the committees of Congress with jurisdiction over the subject matter of the rule.
:::(C) The agency, if the agency is not seeking to repeal a rule, shall develop at least 3 distinct regulatory options, in addition to not regulating, that the agency estimates will provide the greatest benefits for the least cost in meeting the regulatory objective set under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (B)]and, in developing such regulatory options, shall apply the following principles:
::::(i) The agency shall assume that individuals are rational and not qualify that assumption unless the agency—
:::::(I) has conclusive evidence of a detrimental systematic behavioral bias; and
:::::(II) can devise behavioral regulatory options that do not preclude any choices of market participants.
::::(ii) The agency shall, to the extent practicable, attempt to engage private incentives to solve a problem and not supplant private incentives any more than necessary.
::::(iii) The agency shall consider the adverse effects that mandates and prohibitions may have on innovation, economic growth, and employment.
::::(iv) An agency’s risk assessment shall be confined to its jurisdiction, subject to specific regulatory authority. Agency assessments of the risks of adverse health and environmental effects shall follow standardized parameters, assumptions, and methodologies. An agency also shall provide analyses of increases in risks, whatever their nature, produced by the regulatory options under consideration.
::::(v) The agency shall avoid incongruities and duplication in regulation at the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels.
::::(vi) The agency shall compare and contrast the regulatory options developed and explain how each would meet the regulatory objective set pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (B)].
:::(D) The agency shall estimate the costs and benefits of each regulatory option developed, notwithstanding any provision of law that prohibits the agency from using costs in rulemaking, at least to the extent that the agency is able to—
::::(i) exclude options whose costs exceed their benefits;
::::(ii) rank the options by cost from lowest to highest;
::::(iii) estimate the monetary cost of any adverse effects on private property rights, identify the categories of persons who experience a net loss from a regulatory option, and explain why the negative effects cannot be lessened or avoided;
::::(iv) establish whether the cost of an option exceeds $50,000,000 for any 12-month period, except that the dollar amount shall be adjusted annually for inflation based on the GDP deflator, and the President may order that a lower dollar amount be used for a particular period; and
::::(v) identify the key uncertainties and assumptions that drive the results and provide an analysis of how the ranking of the options and the threshold determination under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (iv)]may change if key assumptions are changed.
:::(E) The estimates pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (D)]shall—
::::(i) follow the methodology established pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (2)(A)];
::::(ii) to the maximum extent practicable, comply with any guidelines issued by the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]]pertaining to cost-benefit analysis; and
::::(iii) include, at a minimum—
:::::(I) agency administrative costs;
:::::(II) United States private sector compliance costs;
:::::(III) Federal, State, local, and tribal compliance costs;
:::::(IV) Federal, State, local, and tribal revenue impacts;
:::::(V) impacts from the regulatory options developed on United States industries in the role of suppliers and consumers to each industry substantially affected, especially in terms of employment, costs, volume and quality of output, and prices;
:::::(VI) nationwide impacts on overall economic output, productivity, consumer and producer prices;
:::::(VII) international competitiveness of United States companies; and
:::::(VIII) distortions in incentives and markets, including an estimate of the resulting loss to the United States economy.
:::(F) The agency shall publish for public comment all analyses, documentation, and data under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraphs (A) through (D)]for a public comment period of at least 30 days (subject to applicable limitations under law, including laws protecting privacy, trade secrets, and intellectual property) and correct deficiencies or omissions that the agency becomes aware of before choosing a rule to propose.
::(2) 
:::(A) Beginning not later than the date that is 180 days after the effective date of this section—
::::(i) each agency shall, by rule, establish and maintain the specific cost-benefit analysis methodology appropriate to the functions and responsibilities of that agency and establish an appropriate period for review of new rules to assess the cost effectiveness of each such new rule at achieving the objective identified under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (1)(B)(i)]the new rule was intended to address;

==Title XV— Northern Route Approval==



==Sec. 6001. Short title==

This title may be cited as the“ Northern Route Approval Act ”.

==Sec. 6002. Findings==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) To maintain our Nation’s competitive edge and ensure an economy built to last, the United States must have fast, reliable, resilient, and environmentally sound means of moving energy. In a global economy, we will compete for the world’s investments based in significant part on the quality of our infrastructure. Investing in the Nation’s infrastructure provides immediate and long-term economic benefits for local communities and the Nation as a whole.
:(2) The delivery of oil from Canada, a close ally not only in proximity but in shared values and ideals, to domestic markets is in the national interest because of the need to lessen dependence upon insecure foreign sources.
:(3) The Keystone XL pipeline would provide both short-term and long-term employment opportunities and related labor income benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes.
:(4) The State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will have minimal environmental impacts.
:(5) The [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]and other Federal agencies have over a long period of time conducted extensive studies and analysis of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, and—
::(A) the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]assessments found that the Keystone XL pipeline“is not likely to impact the amount of crude oil produced from the oil sands”and that“approval or denial of the proposed project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands”;
::(B) the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]found that incremental life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, with the upper end of this range representing twelve one-thousandths of one percent of the 6,702 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the United States in 2011; and
::(C) after extensive evaluation of potential impacts to land and water resources along the Keystone XL pipeline’s 875-mile proposed route, the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]found that“The analyses of potential impacts associated with construction and normal operation of the proposed Project suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with all laws and required conditions and measures).”.
:(6) The transportation of oil via pipeline is the safest and most economically and environmentally effective means of doing so, and—
::(A) transportation of oil via pipeline has a record of unmatched safety and environmental protection, and the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]found that“Spills associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment expected to be rare and relatively small”, and that“there is no evidence of increased corrosion or other pipeline threat due to viscosity”of diluted bitumen oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL pipeline; and
::(B) plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special conditions related to the design, construction, and operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]to find that the pipeline will have“a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline”.
:(7) The Keystone XL is in much the same position today as the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 prior to congressional action. Once again, the Federal regulatory process remains an insurmountable obstacle to a project that is likely to reduce oil imports from insecure foreign sources.

==Sec. 6003. Keystone XL permit approval==
