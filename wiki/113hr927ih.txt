For purposes of determining capital requirements or measuring capital of an insured depository institution under section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1831o 12 U.S.C. 1831o] )or any other provision of law or regulatory guidance, an insured depository institution that would otherwise be required to treat a loan as a non-accrual loan may treat such loan as an accrual loan, if—
:(1) the loan is current;
:(2) during the previous 6-month period, no monthly payment on the loan has been more than 30 days delinquent; and
:(3) the payments on the loan are being made pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and any refinances and modifications that are agreed to by all of the parties.

==(b) Demonstration of ability To perform on a loan– ==

Notwithstanding subsection (a), a modified or restructured loan may not be treated as a non-accrual loan if the borrower demonstrates the ability to perform on such a loan—

:(2) with respect to a loan on a quarterly, semi-annual, or longer repayment schedule, over a period of 3 consecutive payments.

==(c) No additional adverse treatment– ==

With respect to a loan held by an insured depository institution and treated as an accrual loan by reason of subsection (a), an appropriate Federal banking agency may not impose any additional accounting requirements on such institution with respect to such loan compared to the requirements that would otherwise have been placed on such institution with respect to such loan if such loan were not being treated as an accrual loan by reason of subsection (a), if the result of such additional requirement would adversely impact the measurement of capital of the institution.

==(d) Prohibition on the re-Classification of loans based solely on collateral value– ==

An appropriate Federal banking agency may not require an insured depository institution to treat a loan as a non-accrual loan solely on the basis that the collateral of such loan has reduced in value.

This section shall not apply with respect to any issuer of a security registered pursuant to section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78l 15 U.S.C. 78l] ).
