{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to provide for the establishment of Youth Corps programs and provide for wider dissemination of the Youth Corps model.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Youth Corps Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Nationally, there are an estimated 5,500,000 youth, ages 16 through 24, out-of-school and out-of-work, with an additional over 500,000 young people dropping out of school each year. At present, the unemployment rate for youth ages 16 through 24 is approximately 17 percent. For youth who are in low-income or minority communities, or who have disabilities, this rate is significantly higher.
:(2) Youth Service and Conservation Corps programs, descended from the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s, have been preparing disadvantaged and disconnected youth for careers in resource conservation, environmental restoration, land management, building renovation and weatherization, education, human services, health care, homeland security, and disaster relief for over 4 decades. To date, nearly a million young people have found a new start through a Youth Service and Conservation Corps program.
:(3) Today, over 125 Youth Service and Conservation Corps programs are being carried out in 50 States and the District of Columbia, and employing a research-driven strategy, called the Youth Corps model, to reengage and provide educational and economic opportunity to around 30,000 young people each year. These Corps members participate in 13.5 million hours of community service annually.
:(4) According to a recent study by the Corporation for National and Community Service, participating in service increases your likelihood of finding employment by 27 percent. When limited to individuals living in rural areas or without a high school diploma, the increase in likelihood of gaining employment jumps to 55 percent and 51 percent, respectively.
:(5) Due to the many benefits and positive outcomes, not only for program participants but also for the communities in which they serve, the Youth Corps model is a proven strategy for reengaging disconnected youth in education and the workforce, while improving communities and the environment.
