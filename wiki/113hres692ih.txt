{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding actions the President should take to secure the borders of the United States.    Whereas on June 17, 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton issued a memo directing [[w:U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]personnel to cease enforcing immigration laws except in certain narrowly proscribed circumstances, so that the vast majority of illegal aliens would not be subject to deportation;   Whereas on June 15, 2012, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]announced that the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]]would no longer be enforcing immigration laws against certain people who came to this country as children, through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) directive;   Whereas, according to [[w:U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Patrol]]statistics, between fiscal years 2009 and 2011, the number of minors from Central America being apprehended at the southwest border for illegal crossing was between 3,300–4,500 per year;   Whereas in fiscal year 2012, the number of minors from Central America began increasing, from over 10,000 in 2012, to over 20,000 in 2013, to 44,000 through June 30 of 2014;   Whereas
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]]has stated that he is constrained by [[Public Law 110-457|section 235 ofPublic Law 110–457,]] the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008  ;   Whereas Senator Dianne Feinstein of California was quoted in the New York Times on July 7, 2014,“That law already provides the administration with flexibility to accelerate the judicial process in times of crisis. The administration should use that flexibility to speed up the system while still treating these children humanely, with compassion and respect.”;   Whereas Senator Harry Reid of Nevada was quoted in the Washington Times on July 15, 2014, that“There’s leeway there that the executive branch of government doesn’t need new legislation.”;   Whereas the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]has the authority to deploy the [[w:Army National Guard|National Guard]]to secure the border from illegal crossers under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/32/502 title 32, section 502(f)];   Whereas the influx of minors illegally crossing at the southwest border was created by policies and statements of the [[w:President of the United States|President of the United States]]and his Administration, which led families to hire criminal smuggling organizations to bring their children to enter the United States without authorization or visa, knowing they would be allowed to remain and seek legal status; and   Whereas the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]already possesses the tools to address this influx: Now, therefore, be it
