{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of Congress that construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the Federal approvals required for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline are in the national interest of the United States.Whereas safe and responsible production, transportation, and use of oil and petroleum products provide the foundation of the energy economy of the United States, helping to secure and advance the economic prosperity, national security, and overall quality of life in the United States;Whereas the Keystone XL pipeline would provide short- and long-term employment opportunities and related labor income benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes;Whereas the State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will have minimal environmental impacts;Whereas the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] and other Federal agencies have conducted extensive studies and analysis over a long period of time on the technical, environmental, social, and economic impact of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline;Whereas assessments by the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] found that the Keystone XL pipeline is “not likely to impact the amount of crude oil produced from the oil sands” and that “approval or denial of the proposed Project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands” ;Whereas the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] found that the incremental life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, with the upper end of this range representing12/1,000of 1 percent of the 6,702,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the United States in 2011;Whereas after extensive evaluation of potential impact to land and water resources along the 875-mile proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline, the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] found, “The analyses of potential impacts associated with construction and normal operation of the proposed Project suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with all laws and required conditions and measures).” ;Whereas the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] found that “<nowiki>[s]pills associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment are expected to be rare and relatively small</nowiki>” and that “there is no evidence of increased corrosion or other pipeline threat due to viscosity” of diluted bitumen oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL pipeline;Whereas, the National Research Council convened a special expert panel to review the risk of transporting diluted bitumen by pipeline and issued a report in June 2013 to the Department of Transportation in which the National Research Council found that existing literature indicates that transportation of diluted bitumen poses no increased risk of pipeline failure;Whereas plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special conditions relating to the design, construction, and operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] to find that the pipeline will have “a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline” ; andWhereas, the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] found that oil destined to be shipped through the pipeline from the oil sands region of Canada and oil shale deposits in the United States would otherwise move by other modes of transportation if the Keystone XL pipeline is not built: Now, therefore, be it

= =

That it is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote sound investment in the infrastructure of the United States;
:(2) construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will promote energy security in North America and will generate an increase in private sector jobs that will benefit both the region surrounding the Keystone XL pipeline and the United States as a whole; and
:(3) completion of the Keystone XL pipeline is in the national interest of the United States.
