{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating October 2013 as National Work and Family Month .    Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit professional association with expertise in attracting, motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of a job and the supportiveness of a workplace are key predictors of the job productivity, job satisfaction, and commitment to the employer of workers, as well as of the ability of an employer to retain workers;   Whereas the term work-life balance refers to specific organizational practices, policies, and programs that are guided by a philosophy of active support for the efforts of employees to achieve success within and outside the workplace, such as caring for dependents, promoting health and wellness, providing paid and unpaid time off, providing financial support, encouraging community involvement, and improving workplace culture;   Whereas numerous studies show that employers that offer effective work-life balance programs are better able to recruit more talented employees, maintain a happier, healthier, and less stressed workforce, and retain experienced employees, which produces a more productive and stable workforce with less voluntary turnover;   Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more involved in the lives of their children, and research demonstrates that parental involvement is associated with higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout rates in children;   Whereas military families have special work-life needs that often require robust policies and programs that provide flexibility to employees in unique circumstances;   Whereas studies show that family rituals such as sitting down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends and holidays positively influence the health and development of children, and that children who eat dinner with their families every day consume nearly a full serving more of fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner with their families or do so only occasionally; and   Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to designate as National Work and Family Month: Now, therefore, be it
