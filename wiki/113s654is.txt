For purposes of this subsection, a collegiate housing and infrastructure grant to an organization described in subsection (c)(2) or (c)(7) holding title to property exclusively for the benefit of an organization described in subsection (c)(7) shall be considered a grant to the organization described in subsection (c)(7) for whose benefit such property is held. .
