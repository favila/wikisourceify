The term covered entity means an entity—
:(I) that operates a complex of 2 or more movie theaters, screening rooms, or similar venues, at a single location, that are used for the exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures, if such exhibition is open to the public; and

=====(iii) Open captioning– =====

The term open captioning means a method, process, or mechanism that—
:(I) allows an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing to have access to the content of a motion picture; and
:(II) allows that access by openly displaying on the movie screen involved all of the audio portion of the motion picture (including displaying the dialogue and any narration, as well as descriptions of on- and off-screen sounds such as sound effects, music, or lyrics for music, and information identifying the character who is speaking) as text that can be effectively viewed by that individual and other members of the audience while the individual and members simultaneously watch the motion picture.

The term video description means a method, process, or mechanism, including a device, that—
:(I) allows an individual who is blind or visually impaired to have access to the key visual elements of a motion picture (such as actions, settings, facial expressions, costumes, and scene changes); and
