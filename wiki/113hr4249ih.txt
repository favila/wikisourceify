{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to expand and improve Federal programs to reduce child hunger.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Helping Hungry Students Learn Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) In 2012, nearly one in five children in America lived in a household that lacked access to nutritious food on a regular basis. That is 15.9 million American children who struggled with hunger at some time during the year.
:(2) Children who experience hunger are more likely to get sick and are more likely to be obese than those who do not. Children facing chronic hunger also find it more difficult to concentrate in school and tend to exhibit higher levels of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems.
:(3) Federal programs play an important role in addressing childhood hunger. In 2013, 21 million students participated in the free or reduced-price lunch program. Eleven million students participated in the free or reduced-price breakfast program. Three million low-income children received free meals during the summer months. Forty-seven percent of participants in the supplemental nutrition assistance program are under the age of 18.
:(4) On average, students who eat school breakfast achieve 17.5 percent higher scores on standardized math tests, and attend 1.5 more days of school each year than those who do not. Students who attend class more regularly are 20 percent more likely to graduate from high school. Participation in the school breakfast program is associated with children having a lower Body Mass Index.
