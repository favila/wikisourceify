      Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of
			 cancer death among men and women in the United States, killing more non-smokers
			 than any other cancer;
		
    
      Whereas every year it is estimated that more than 135,000
			 individuals in the United States are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more
			 than 50,000 individuals die from the disease;
		
    
      Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most highly
			 preventable forms of cancer because screening tests can find polyps that can be
			 removed before becoming cancerous;
		
    
      Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer
			 early, when treatment works best;
		
    
      Whereas the 
                [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]
            
			 estimates that if every individual aged 50 or older had regular screening
			 tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be
			 prevented;
		
    
      Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with
			 localized colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 percent of all diagnoses
			 occur at this stage;
		
    
      Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively
			 reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, yet, 1 in 3 adults between
			 the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with recommended colorectal cancer
			 screening;
		
    
      Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on
			 colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms are held during the month
			 of March each year; and
		
    
      Whereas educational efforts can help provide information
			 to the public of methods of prevention and screening, as well as about symptoms
			 for early detection: Now, therefore, be it
