Upon request of the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]or users of the mails, or upon its own initiative, the [[w:Postal Rate Commission|Postal Regulatory Commission]]may change the classes of mail to which the annual limitation under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3622 section 3622(d)(1)]applies by adding new classes of mail. The [[w:Postal Rate Commission|Postal Regulatory Commission]]shall, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, promulgate (and may from time to time thereafter revise) regulations to carry out this section.

=====(b) Criteria– =====

All determinations by the [[w:Postal Rate Commission|Postal Regulatory Commission]]under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3643 subsection (a)]shall be made in accordance with the following criteria:

======(1) New market– ======

Dominant classes of mail shall consist of products in the sale of which the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]exercises sufficient market power that it can effectively set the price of such product substantially above costs, raise prices significantly, decrease quality, or decrease output, without risk of losing a significant level of business to other firms offering similar products.

======(2) Products covered by postal monopoly– ======

Any new classes of mail containing any products covered by the postal monopoly shall be subject to the requirements of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3622 section 3622(d)(1)]. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term“product covered by the postal monopoly”means any product the conveyance or transmission of which is reserved to the United States under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1696  section 1696of title 18], subject to the same exception as set forth in the last sentence of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/409 section 409(e)(1)].

======(3) Additional considerations– ======

In making any decision under this section, due regard shall be given to—
:(A) the availability and nature of enterprises in the private sector engaged in the delivery of the product involved;
:(B) the views of those who use the product involved on the appropriateness of the proposed action; and
:(C) the likely impact of the proposed action on small business concerns (within the meaning of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3641 section 3641(h)]).

=====(c) Notification and publication requirements– =====



======(1) Notification requirement– ======

The [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]shall, whenever it requests to add a new class of mail, file with the [[w:Postal Rate Commission|Postal Regulatory Commission]]and publish in the Federal Register a notice setting out the basis for its determination that the product satisfies the criteria under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3643 subsection (b)]. The provisions of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/504 section 504(g)]shall be available with respect to any information required to be filed.

======(2) Publication requirement– ======

The [[w:Postal Rate Commission|Postal Regulatory Commission]]shall, whenever it changes the list of market-dominant classes of mail, prescribe new lists of classes of mail. The revised lists shall indicate how and when any previous lists are superseded, and shall be published in the Federal Register.

=====(d) Prohibition– =====

Except as provided in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3641 section 3641], a class of mail that involves the physical delivery of letters, printed matter, or packages may be offered by the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]unless it has been assigned as a new class of mail—
