Expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to childhood stroke and recognizing May 2013 as “National Pediatric Stroke Awareness Month” .Whereas a stroke, also known as cerebrovascular disease, is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in the artery or a burst of the artery;Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated;Whereas stroke occurs in approximately 1 out of every 3,500 live births, and has an overall annual incidence of 4.6 per 100,000 children age 19 and under;Whereas a stroke can occur before birth;Whereas stroke is among the top 12 causes of death for children between the ages of 1 and 14 in the United States;Whereas 20 to 40 percent of children who have suffered a stroke die as a result;Whereas stroke recurs within 5 years in 10 percent of children who have had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke;Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke before the age of 1 year is the highest out of all child age groups;Whereas there are no approved therapies for the treatment of acute stroke in infants and children;Whereas approximately 60 percent of infants and children who have a pediatric stroke will have serious, permanent neurological disabilities, including paralysis, seizures, speech and vision problems, and attention, learning, and behavioral difficulties;Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical therapy and surgeries;Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young adulthood have a considerable impact on children, families, and society;Whereas not enough is known about the cause, treatment, and prevention of pediatric stroke;Whereas medical research is the only means by which the people of the United States can identify and develop effective treatment and prevention strategies for pediatric stroke; andWhereas early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric stroke greatly improves the chances that the affected child will recover and not experience a recurrence: Now, therefore, be it
