{{Center|A BILL}}

 To reduce by 5 percent the discretionary budget authority of any Federal agency for a fiscal year if the financial statement of the agency for the previous fiscal year does not receive a qualified or unqualified audit opinion by an external independent auditor, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Audit the Pentagon Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are as follows:
:(1) To strengthen American national security by ensuring that—
::(A) military planning, operations, weapons development, and a long-term national security strategy are connected to sound financial controls; and
::(B) defense dollars are spent efficiently.
:(2) To instill a culture of accountability at the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]that supports the vast majority of dedicated members of the Armed Forces and civilians who want to ensure proper accounting and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. 

=Sec. 3. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The 2012 Financial Report of the United States Government found that 21 of 24 major Federal agencies received clean audit opinions. Two more, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]and the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]], received“qualified”audit opinions but are making progress. Only the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]had a“disclaimer”because it lacked any auditable reporting or accounting available for independent review. In the Financial Report, the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]summarized:“Over the past 20 years, an increasing number of Federal agencies have initiated and sustained disciplined and consistent financial reporting operations, implemented effective internal controls around financial reporting, and have successfully integrated transaction processing and accounting records. These efforts have resulted in improved results on financial statement audits. However, weaknesses in basic financial management practices and other limitations continue to prevent one major agency, and the Government as a whole, from achieving an audit opinion.”.
:(2) The financial management of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]has been on the“High-Risk”list of the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]](GAO). The [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]]found that the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]]is not consistently able to“control costs; ensure basic accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; and prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse”.
:(3) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]stated that past expenditures by the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]of $5,800,000,000 to improve financial information, and billions of dollars more of anticipated expenditures on new information technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]]. At that hearing, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]could not predict when the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]]would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.
:(4) Section 9 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States requires all agencies of the Federal Government, including the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to publish“a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money”.
:(5)    Section 303(d) of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 ([[Public Law 101-576|Public Law 101–576]] )required that financial statements be prepared and independently audited for the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]]by March 31, 1992, and for the [[w:United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]]by March 31, 1993. Neither the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]]nor the [[w:United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]]has complied.
:(6)  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3515 Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code], requires the agencies of the Federal Government, including the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to present auditable financial statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]]has not complied with this law.
:(7) The  Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3512 31 U.S.C. 3512 note])requires financial systems acquired by the Federal Government, including the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to be able to provide information to leaders to manage and control the cost of government. The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]]has not complied with this law.
:(8) The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 ([[Public Law 107-107|Public Law 107–107]] )requires the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]to report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]annually on the reliability of the financial statements of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to minimize resources spent on producing unreliable financial statements, and to use resources saved to improve financial management policies, procedures, and internal controls.
:(9) In 2005, the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]created a Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a directorate within the office of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Under Secretary of Defense]](Comptroller), to improve [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]]business processes with the goal of producing timely, reliable, and accurate financial information that could generate an audit-ready annual financial statement. In December 2005, that directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.
:(10) The  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 ([[Public Law 111-84|Public Law 111–84]] )requires regular status reports on the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described in paragraph (9) , and codified as a statutory requirement the goal of the Plan in ensuring that [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]financial statements are validated as ready for audit not later than September 30, 2017.

===(2) Applicability to military departments and defense agencies– ===

For purposes of paragraph (1) , in the case of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], each military department and each Defense Agency shall be treated as a separate Federal agency.

In this section, the terms“financial statement”and“external independent auditor”have the same meanings as those terms have under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3521 section 3521(e) of title 31, United States Code].

==(c) Adjustments for Financial Accountability– ==


:(1) On March 2 of fiscal year 2014 and each subsequent fiscal year, the discretionary budget authority available for each Federal agency for such fiscal year is adjusted as provided in paragraph (2) .
:(2) If a Federal agency has not submitted a financial statement for the previous fiscal year, or if such financial statement has not received either an unqualified or a qualified audit opinion by an independent external auditor, the discretionary budget authority available for the Federal agency is reduced by 5 percent, with the reduction applied proportionately to each account (other than an account listed in subsection (d) or an account for which a waiver is made under subsection (e) ).
:(3) An amount equal to the total amount of any reduction under paragraph (2) shall be retained in the general fund of the Treasury for the purposes of deficit reduction.

:(2) The Defense Health Program account of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

==(e) Waiver– ==

The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]may waive subsection (c)(2) with respect to an account if the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]certifies that applying the subsection to that account would harm national security or members of the Armed Forces who are in combat.

==(f) Report– ==

Not later than 60 days after an adjustment under subsection (c) , the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director of the Office of Management and Budget]]shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]a report describing the amount and account of each adjustment.

=Sec. 6. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of Congress that—
:(1) as the overall defense budget is cut, congressional defense committees and the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]should not endanger the Nation’s troops by reducing wounded warrior accounts or vital protection (such as body armor) for members of the Armed Forces in harm’s way;
:(2) the valuation of legacy assets by the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]should be simplified without compromising essential controls or generally accepted government auditing standards; and
:(3) nothing in this Act should be construed to require or permit the declassification of accounting details about classified defense programs, and, as required by law, the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]should ensure financial accountability in such programs using proven practices, including using auditors with security clearances.
