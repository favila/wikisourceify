==Title I— Fair elections financing of Senate election campaigns==



===A Fair elections financing program– ===



===Sec. 101. Findings and declarations===



====(a) Undermining of democracy by campaign contributions from private sources– ====

The [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]finds and declares that the current system of privately financed campaigns for election to the [[w:United States Senate|United States Senate]]has the capacity, and is often perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United States by—
:(1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large campaign contributions from private interests that are directly affected by Federal legislation;
:(2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators' accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to be accountable to the major contributors who finance their election campaigns;
:(3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and unfair influence within the political process;
:(4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;
:(5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to mount competitive [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]election campaigns;
:(6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive elections; and
:(7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry out their public responsibilities.

====(b) Enhancement of democracy by providing allocations from the Fair Elections Fund– ====

The [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]finds and declares that providing the option of the replacement of large private campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections to the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]would enhance American democracy by—
:(1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest created by fully private financing of the election campaigns of public officials and restoring public confidence in the integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative processes through a program which allows participating candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral campaigns;
:(2) increasing the public's confidence in the accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and participate in the program;
:(3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence within the political process by facilitating the expression of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging political participation, and incentivizing participation on the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar contributions;
:(4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the influence of campaign contributions;
:(5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run for the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]and encouraging more competitive elections;
:(6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by citizens of every level of wealth; and
:(7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their public responsibilities.

===Sec. 102. Eligibility requirements and benefits of Fair Elections financing of Senate election campaigns===

The   Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971  ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/431 2 U.S.C. 431 et seq].)is amended by adding at the end the following:
