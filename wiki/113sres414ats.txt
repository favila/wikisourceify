{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating April 2014 as“National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month”.    Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia (referred to in this preamble as“CDH”) occurs when the diaphragm fails to fully form, allowing abdominal organs to migrate into the chest cavity and preventing lung growth;   Whereas the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]recognizes CDH as a birth defect;   Whereas the majority of CDH patients suffer from underdeveloped lungs or poor pulmonary function;   Whereas babies born with CDH endure extended hospital stays in intensive care with multiple surgeries;   Whereas CDH patients often endure long-term complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypoplasia, asthma, gastrointestinal reflex, feeding disorders, and developmental delays;   Whereas CDH survivors sometimes endure long-term mechanical ventilation dependency, skeletal malformations, supplemental oxygen dependency, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and hypoxic brain injury;   Whereas CDH is treated through mechanical ventilation, a heart and lung bypass (commonly known as“extracorporeal membrane oxygenation”), machines, and surgical repair;   Whereas surgical repair is often not a permanent solution for CDH and can lead to reherniation and require additional surgery;   Whereas CDH is diagnosed in utero in less than 50 percent of cases;   Whereas infants born with CDH have a high mortality rate, ranging from 20 to 60 percent, depending on the severity of the defect and interventions available at delivery;   Whereas CDH has a rate of occurrence of 1 in every 3,800 live births worldwide;   Whereas CDH affects approximately 1,088 babies each year in the United States;   Whereas CDH has affected more than 700,000 babies worldwide since 2000;   Whereas CDH does not discriminate based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status;   Whereas the cause of CDH is unknown;   Whereas the average CDH survivor will face postnatal care of at least $100,000; and   Whereas Federal support for CDH research at the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]]for 2013 is estimated to be not more than $3,000,000: Now, therefore, be it
