=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Small Public Housing Agency Opportunity Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Although small public housing agencies are numerous, they administer only a small fraction of the financial resources provided under the Federal housing programs.
:(2) The oversight of small public housing agencies by the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] is disproportionate to the financial risk the operations of these agencies pose to the Federal Government.
:(3) Small public housing agencies perform better than larger agencies, as public housing agency performance is presently measured by the Federal Government.
:(4) The [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] should deploy its administrative oversight resources in a manner that reflects relative risk to the Federal Government.
:(5) Regulatory and administrative burdens that may be reasonable for larger public housing agencies may not be so for smaller public housing agencies with more limited resources.
:(6) Eliminating unnecessary or unreasonable regulatory and administrative burdens will improve the effectiveness of small public housing agencies as providers of housing assistance to low-income families.
:(7) Small public housing agencies and their residents would benefit from, and small public housing agencies should be afforded, maximum flexibility in the use of their resources.
:(8)  [[w:|Congress]] and the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] should reduce administrative and regulatory burdens on small public housing agencies.
:(9) Public housing revitalization funding has been largely unavailable to small public housing agencies.
:(10)  [[w:|Congress]] should establish a program of assistance to enable public housing revitalization activities by small public housing agencies.
:(11) Small public housing agencies and their residents would benefit from conversion of their public housing projects to projects assisted with project-based section 8rental assistance.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to assure the long-term viability and effectiveness of the small public housing agencies and the housing assistance programs they operate;
:(2) to ensure that small public housing agencies are not subject to unnecessary Federal regulatory control and administrative requirements;
:(3) to afford flexibility to small public housing agencies in the use of their resources;
:(4) to adjust Federal oversight requirements for small public housing agencies to better reflect financial risk to the Federal Government and the relative resources of such agencies;
:(5) to explore innovative approaches to simplifying determination of income and tenant rents; and
:(6) to ensure that small public housing agencies have access to the resources necessary for the modernization and revitalization of their public housing stock.
