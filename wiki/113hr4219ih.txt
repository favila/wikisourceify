 To amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide for the recognition of voluntary certification programs for air conditioning, furnace, boiler, heat pump, and water heater products.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Voluntary Certification Program Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Voluntary certification programs for air conditioning, furnace, boiler, heat pump, and water heater products=

===(A) Definition of basic model group– ===

In this paragraph, the term basic model group means a set of models—
:(i) that share characteristics that allow the performance of 1 model to be generally representative of the performance of other models within the group; and
:(ii) in which the group of products does not necessarily have to share discrete performance.

===(B) Reliance on voluntary certification programs– ===

For the purpose of testing to verify the performance rating of, or receiving test reports from manufacturers certifying compliance with energy conservation standards and Energy Star specifications established under sections 324A , 325 , and 342 , the covered products described in paragraphs (3) , (4) , (5) , (9) , and (11) of section 322(a) and covered equipment described in subparagraphs (B) , (C) , (D) , (F) , (I) , (J) , and (K) of section 340(1) , the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]and [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall rely on voluntary certification programs that—
:(i) are nationally recognized;
:(ii) maintain a publicly available list of all certified products and equipment;
:(iii) as determined by the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]], annually test not less than 10 percent and not more than 30 percent of the basic model group of a program participant;
:(iv) require the changing of the performance rating or removal of the product or equipment from the program, if verification testing determines that the performance rating does not meet the levels the manufacturer has certified to the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]];
:(v) require the qualification of new participants in the program through testing and production of test reports;
:(vi) allow for challenge testing of products and equipment within the scope of the program;
:(vii) require program participants to certify the performance rating of all covered products and equipment within the scope of the program;
:(viii) are conducted by a certification body that is accredited under International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Standard 17065;
:(ix) provide to the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]—
::(I) an annual report of all test results;
::(II) prompt notification when program testing results in—
:::(aa) the rerating of the performance rating of a product or equipment; or
:::(bb) the delisting of a product or equipment; and
::(III) test reports, on the request of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]or the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], for Energy Star compliant products, which shall be treated as confidential business information as provided for under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552  section 552(b)(4)of title 5, United States Code](commonly known as the“  Freedom of Information Act  ”);
:(x) use verification testing that—
::(I) is conducted by an independent test laboratory that is accredited under International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Standard 17025 with a scope covering the tested products or equipment;
::(II) follows the test procedures established under this title; and
::(III) notes in each test report any instructions specified by the manufacturer or the representative of the manufacturer for the purpose of conducting the verification testing; and
:(xi) satisfy such other requirements as the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]has determined—
