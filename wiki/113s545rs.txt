=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds that—
:(1) hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable electricity in the United States;
:(2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, hydropower resources, including pumped storage facilities, provide—
::(A) nearly 7 percent of the electricity generated in the United States, avoiding approximately 200,000,000 metric tons of carbon emissions each year; and
::(B) approximately 100,000 megawatts of electric capacity in the United States;
:(3) only 3 percent of the 80,000 dams in the United States generate electricity so there is substantial potential for adding hydropower generation to nonpower dams;
:(4) in every State, a tremendous untapped growth potential exists in hydropower resources, including—
::(A) efficiency improvements and capacity additions;
::(B) adding generation to nonpower dams;
::(C) conduit hydropower;
::(D) conventional hydropower;
::(E) pumped storage facilities; and
::(F) new marine and hydrokinetic resources; and
:(5) improvements in increased hydropower production in the United States have the potential—
::(A) to increase the clean energy generation of the United States;
::(B) to improve project performance and result in better environmental outcomes; and
::(C) to provide ancillary benefits that include grid reliability, energy storage, and integration services for variable renewable resources.

==(3) Small hydroelectric power project– ==

The term small hydroelectric power project has the meaning given the term in section 4.30 of title 18, Code of Federal Regulations. 

=Sec. 4. Sense of the Senate on the use of hydropower renewable resources=

It is the sense of the Senate that the United States should increase substantially the capacity and generation of clean, renewable hydropower which will improve the environmental quality of resources in the United States and support local job creation and economic investment across the United States. 

=Sec. 5. Promoting hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects=



==(a) In general– ==
