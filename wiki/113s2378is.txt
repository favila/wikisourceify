==Title I— Commercial privacy==



==Sec. 101. Short title==

This title may be cited as the“   Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights Act of 2014   ”.

==Sec. 102. Findings==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Personal privacy is worthy of protection through appropriate legislation.
:(2) Trust in the treatment of personally identifiable information collected on and off the Internet is essential for businesses to succeed.
:(3) Persons interacting with others engaged in interstate commerce have a significant interest in their personal information, as well as a right to control how that information is collected, used, stored, or transferred.
:(4) Persons engaged in interstate commerce and collecting personally identifiable information on individuals have a responsibility to treat that information with respect and in accordance with common standards.
:(5) On the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, the laws of the Federal Government and State and local governments provided inadequate privacy protection for individuals engaging in and interacting with persons engaged in interstate commerce.
:(6) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, with the exception of [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]]enforcement of laws against unfair and deceptive practices, the Federal Government has eschewed general commercial privacy laws in favor of industry self-regulation, which has led to several self-policing schemes, some of which are enforceable, and some of which provide insufficient privacy protection to individuals.
:(7) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, many collectors of personally identifiable information have yet to provide baseline fair information practice protections for individuals.
:(8) The ease of gathering and compiling personal information on the Internet and off, both overtly and surreptitiously, is becoming increasingly efficient and effortless due to advances in technology which have provided information gatherers the ability to compile seamlessly highly detailed personal histories of individuals.
:(9) Personal information requires greater privacy protection than is available on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act. Vast amounts of personal information, including sensitive information, about individuals are collected on and off the Internet, often combined and sold or otherwise transferred to third parties, for purposes unknown to an individual to whom the personally identifiable information pertains.
:(10) Toward the close of the 20th century, as individuals' personal information was increasingly collected, profiled, and shared for commercial purposes, and as technology advanced to facilitate these practices, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]enacted numerous statutes to protect privacy.
:(11) Those statutes apply to the government, telephones, cable television, e-mail, video tape rentals, and the Internet (but only with respect to children and law enforcement requests).
:(12) As in those instances, the Federal Government has a substantial interest in creating a level playing field of protection across all collectors of personally identifiable information, both in the United States and abroad.
:(13) Enhancing individual privacy protection in a balanced way that establishes clear, consistent rules, both domestically and internationally, will stimulate commerce by instilling greater consumer confidence at home and greater confidence abroad as more and more entities digitize personally identifiable information, whether collected, stored, or used online or offline.

==Title II— Online privacy of children==



==Sec. 201. Short title==

This title may be cited as the“   Do Not Track Kids Act of 2014   ”.

==Sec. 202. Findings==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Since the enactment of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 , the World Wide Web has changed dramatically, with the creation of tens of millions of websites, the proliferation of entirely new media platforms, and the emergence of a diverse ecosystem of services, devices, and applications that enable users to connect wirelessly within an online environment without being tethered to a desktop computer.
:(2) The explosive growth of the Internet ecosystem has unleashed a wide array of opportunities to learn, communicate, participate in civic life, access entertainment, and engage in commerce.
:(3) In addition to these significant benefits, the Internet also presents challenges, particularly with respect to the efforts of entities to track the online activities of children and minors and to collect, use, and disclose personal information about them, including their geolocation, for commercial purposes.
:(4) Children and teens are visiting numerous companies’ websites, and marketers are using multimedia games, online quizzes, and mobile phone and tablet applications to create ties to children and teens.
:(5) According to a study by the Wall Street Journal in 2010, websites directed to children and teens were more likely to use cookies and other tracking tools than sites directed to a general audience.
:(6) This study examined 50 popular websites for children and teens in the United States and found that these 50 sites placed 4,123 cookies, beacons, and other tracking tools on the test computer used for the study.
:(7) This is 30 percent greater than the number of such tracking tools that were placed on the test computer in a similar study of the 50 overall most popular websites in the United States, which are generally directed to adults.
:(8) Children and teens lack the cognitive ability to distinguish advertising from program content and to understand that the purpose of advertising is to persuade them, making them unable to activate the defenses on which adults rely.
:(9) Children and teens are less able than adults to understand the potential long-term consequences of having their information available to third parties, including advertisers, and other individuals.
:(10) According to Common Sense Media and the Center for Digital Democracy, 90 percent of teens have used some form of social media, 75 percent have a social networking site, and 51 percent check their social networking site at least once a day.
:(11) Ninety-one percent of parents and 91 percent of adults believe it is not okay for advertisers to collect information about a child’s location from that child’s mobile phone.
:(12) Ninety-four percent of parents and 91 percent of adults agree that advertisers should receive the parent’s permission before putting tracking software on a child’s computer.
:(13) Ninety-six percent of parents and 94 percent of adults expressed disapproval when asked if it is“okay for a website to ask children for personal information about their friends”.
:(14) Eighty-eight percent of parents would support a law that requires search engines and social networking sites to get users’ permission before using their personal information.
:(15) A Commonsense Media/Zogby poll found that 94 percent of parents and 94 percent of adults believe individuals should have the ability to request the deletion, after a specific period of time, of all of their personal information held by an online search engine, social networking site, or marketing company.
:(16) According to a Pew/Berkman Center poll, 69 percent of parents of teens who engage in online activity are concerned about how that activity might affect their children’s future academic or employment opportunities.
:(17) Eighty-one percent of parents of teens who engage in online activity say they are concerned about how much information advertisers can learn about their children’s online activity.
