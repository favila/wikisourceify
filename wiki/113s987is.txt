=Section 1. Short title=

=Sec. 2. Compelled disclosure from covered persons=



==(a) Conditions for compelled disclosure– ==

In any proceeding or in connection with any issue arising under Federal law, a Federal entity may not compel a covered person to comply with a subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process seeking to compel the disclosure of protected information, unless a Federal court in the jurisdiction where the subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process has been or would be issued determines, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to such covered person—
:(1) that the party seeking to compel disclosure of the protected information has exhausted all reasonable alternative sources (other than a covered person) of the protected information; and
:(2) that—
::(A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution—
:::(i) if the party seeking to compel disclosure is the Federal Government, based on public information or information obtained from a source other than the covered person, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has occurred;
:::(ii) based on public information or information obtained from a source other than the covered person, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the protected information sought is essential to the investigation or prosecution or to the defense against the prosecution;
:::(iii) the Attorney General certifies that the decision to request compelled disclosure was made in a manner consistent with [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/50 section 50.10] of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, if compelled disclosure is sought by a member of the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in circumstances governed by [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/50 section 50.10] of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations; and
:::(iv) the covered person has not established by clear and convincing evidence that disclosure of the protected information would be contrary to the public interest, taking into account both the public interest in gathering and disseminating the information or news at issue and maintaining the free flow of information and the public interest in compelling disclosure (including the extent of any harm to national security); or
::(B) in a matter other than a criminal investigation or prosecution, based on public information or information obtained from a source other than the covered person—
:::(i) the protected information sought is essential to the resolution of the matter; and
:::(ii) the party seeking to compel disclosure of the protected information has established that the interest in compelling disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in gathering and disseminating the information or news at issue and maintaining the free flow of information.

==(b) Limitations on content of information– ==

A subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process seeking to compel the disclosure of protected information under subsection (a)shall, to the extent possible, be narrowly tailored in purpose, subject matter, and period of time covered so as to avoid compelling disclosure of peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.

=Sec. 3. Exception relating to criminal conduct=



==(a) In general– ==

 Section 2shall not apply to any information, record, document, or item obtained as the result of the eyewitness observations of, or obtained during the course of, alleged criminal conduct by the covered person, including any physical evidence or visual or audio recording of the conduct.

==(b) Exception– ==

This section shall not apply, and, subject to sections 4 and 5, section 2shall apply, if the alleged criminal conduct is the act of communicating the documents or information at issue.

=Sec. 4. Exception to prevent death, kidnapping, substantial bodily injury, sex offenses against minors, or incapacitation or destruction of critical infrastructure=

 Section 2shall not apply to any protected information that is reasonably necessary to stop, prevent, or mitigate a specific case of—
:(1) death;
:(2) kidnapping;
:(3) substantial bodily harm;
:(4) conduct that constitutes a criminal offense that is a specified offense against a minor (as those terms are defined in section 111 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/16911 42 U.S.C. 16911] )), or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a criminal offense; or
:(5) incapacitation or destruction of critical infrastructure (as defined in section 1016(e) of the USA PATRIOT Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/5195c 42 U.S.C. 5195c(e))] ).

=Sec. 5. Exception to prevent terrorist activity or harm to the national security=



==(a) In general– ==

 Section 2shall not apply to any protected information if—
:(1) the party seeking to compel disclosure is the Federal Government; and
:(2) 
::(A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution of the allegedly unlawful disclosure of properly classified information, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected information for which compelled disclosure is sought would materially assist the Federal Government in preventing or mitigating—
:::(i) an act of terrorism; or
:::(ii) other acts that are reasonably likely to cause significant and articulable harm to national security; or
::(B) in any other criminal investigation or prosecution, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected information for which compelled disclosure is sought would materially assist the Federal Government in preventing, mitigating, or identifying the perpetrator of—
:::(i) an act of terrorism; or
:::(ii) other acts that have caused or are reasonably likely to cause significant and ar­tic­u­la­ble harm to national security.

==(b) Deference– ==

In assessing the existence or extent of the harm described in subsection (a), a Federal court shall give appropriate deference to a specific factual showing submitted to the court by the head of any executive branch agency or department concerned.

==(c) Relationship to section 2– ==

 Subsection (a)shall not apply, and, subject to sections 3 and 4, section 2shall apply, to any criminal investigation or prosecution of the allegedly unlawful disclosure of properly classified information other than one in which the protected information is sought by the Federal Government to prevent or mitigate the harm specified in subsection (a)(2)(A). In considering the extent of any harm to national security when applying section 2to such cases, a Federal court shall give appropriate deference to any specific factual showing submitted to the court by the head of any executive branch agency or department concerned.

==(d) Subsequent unlawful disclosure– ==

The potential for a subsequent unlawful disclosure of information by the source sought to be identified shall not, by itself and without any showing of additional facts beyond such potential disclosure, be sufficient to establish that compelled disclosure of the protected information would materially assist the Federal Government in preventing or mitigating—
:(1) an act of terrorism; or
:(2) other acts that are reasonably likely to cause significant and articulable harm to national security.
