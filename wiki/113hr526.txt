      Findings
      
        
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             finds the following:
			
        (1)
        Communities surrounding mountaintop removal
			 coal mining projects, which involve surface coal mining including blasting with
			 explosives in the steep slope regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia,
			 and Virginia, have raised concerns that pollution of the water, air, and soil
			 that results from mountaintop removal coal mining may be causing health crises
			 in their communities.
			
      
        (2)
        Peer-reviewed scientific research and
			 reports have raised serious concerns about mountaintop removal mining with
			 respect to elevated risks in categories of birth defects studied:
			 circulatory/respiratory, central nervous system, musculoskeletal, and
			 gastrointestinal.
			
      
        (3)
        Mountaintop
			 removal coal mining has also been associated with elevated levels of adult
			 hospitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension that are
			 elevated as a function of county-level coal production, as are rates of
			 mortality; lung cancer; and chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease. These
			 health problems strike both women and men in mountaintop removal coal mining
			 communities. These elevated levels of disease, defects, and mortality persist
			 even after controlling for other variables.
			
      
        (4)
        Initial scientific
			 evidence, and the level of public concern, warrant immediate action to stop new
			 mountaintop removal coal mining permits and increase environmental and human
			 health monitoring at existing mountaintop removal coal mining projects while
			 the reported links between health effects and mountaintop removal coal mining
			 are investigated by Federal health agencies.
			
      
        (5)
        The 
                [[National Institutes of Health|National
			 Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]]
             is uniquely qualified to manage a
			 working group of Federal health agencies with expertise that is relevant to
			 study of the reported links.

             deems appropriate, shall—
				
          (1)

			 in the surrounding communities; and
				
        
          (2)
          submit to the
			 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
            , and make publicly available, a report on the results of such
			 studies.
