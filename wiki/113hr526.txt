{{Center|A BILL}}

To place a moratorium on permitting for mountaintop removal coal mining until health studies are conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|HC9E93643B0CB4FEE933EBAB18317B839}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Appalachian Communities Health Emergency Act”or the“ACHE Act”.

={{anchor|HAA7B34605928453EA7BC85EE46F6875E}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Communities surrounding mountaintop removal coal mining projects, which involve surface coal mining including blasting with explosives in the steep slope regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia, have raised concerns that pollution of the water, air, and soil that results from mountaintop removal coal mining may be causing health crises in their communities.
:(2) Peer-reviewed scientific research and reports have raised serious concerns about mountaintop removal mining with respect to elevated risks in categories of birth defects studied: circulatory/respiratory, central nervous system, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal.
:(3) Mountaintop removal coal mining has also been associated with elevated levels of adult hospitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension that are elevated as a function of county-level coal production, as are rates of mortality; lung cancer; and chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease. These health problems strike both women and men in mountaintop removal coal mining communities. These elevated levels of disease, defects, and mortality persist even after controlling for other variables.
:(4) Initial scientific evidence, and the level of public concern, warrant immediate action to stop new mountaintop removal coal mining permits and increase environmental and human health monitoring at existing mountaintop removal coal mining projects while the reported links between health effects and mountaintop removal coal mining are investigated by Federal health agencies.
:(5) The [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] is uniquely qualified to manage a working group of Federal health agencies with expertise that is relevant to study of the reported links.

={{anchor|HC95A8B5DBB5C40489E4C15BE8E3DFABE}}Sec. 3. Health studies=



=={{anchor|HCFE7F7C7FDDE420E9CC7CDB3DBB3F93E}}(a) Studies– ==

The [[w:National Institutes of Health|Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] , in consultation with the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] and the heads of such other Federal departments and agencies as the [[w:National Institutes of Health|Director]] deems appropriate, shall—
:(1) conduct or support comprehensive studies on the health impacts, if any, of mountaintop removal coal mining on individuals in the surrounding communities; and
:(2) submit to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] , and make publicly available, a report on the results of such studies.

=={{anchor|HDC82E57348C64252B677A0EB16287E1B}}(b) Determination– ==

Upon receipt of the report under subsection (a)(2), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] shall publish a determination on whether mountaintop removal coal mining presents any health risks to individuals in the surrounding communities.

={{anchor|HDF240BD38C5B44EA896B5902A5476272}}Sec. 4. Mountaintop removal coal mining permit moratorium=

Until and unless the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] publishes a determination under section 3(b)concluding that mountaintop removal coal mining does not present any health risk to individuals in the surrounding communities, a permit or other authorization may not be issued for any mountaintop removal coal mining project, or for any expansion of such a project, by—
:(1) the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] , acting through the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Chief of Engineers]] , or a State, under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1344 33 U.S.C. 1344] );
:(2) the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] , or a State, under section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1342 33 U.S.C. 1342] ); or
