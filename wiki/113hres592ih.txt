{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Calling for free and fair elections in Ukraine, and for other purposes.    Whereas democracy, human rights, and civil liberties are universal values and fundamental principles of the foreign policy of the United States;   Whereas an essential element of democratic self-government is for leaders to be chosen and regularly held accountable through elections that are organized and conducted in a manner that is free, fair, inclusive, and consistent with international standards;   Whereas governments in which power does not derive from free and fair elections lack democratic legitimacy;   Whereas elections in Ukraine have previously involved restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and association, including censorship, surveillance, lack of transparency, and the absence of a free media;   Whereas, on February 22, 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament voted under its constitutional authority to remove Victor Yanukovych from the post of President of Ukraine; and   Whereas authorities in Ukraine have called for a Presidential election to be held on May 25, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
