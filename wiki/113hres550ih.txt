{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Honoring the Sikh American community’s celebration of Vaisakhi.    Whereas Sikhism is a religion founded in the Punjab region of South Asia over 5 centuries ago and introduced to the United States in the 19th century;   Whereas Sikhism is the fifth largest world religion with approximately 25,000,000 adherents from diverse backgrounds throughout the world, including 500,000 adherents in the United States;   Whereas Sikhs in the United States pursue diverse professions and walks of life, making rich contributions to the economic vibrancy of the United States as farmers, engineers, doctors, scientists, and business owners;   Whereas Sikh Americans continue to make strides toward securing religious liberty as patriotic members of the United States Armed Forces;   Whereas Vaisakhi is one of the most religiously significant days in Sikh history, commemorating the creation of the Khalsa, a fellowship of devout Sikhs, by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699;   Whereas the Sikh religion is based on a belief in one God and the equality of all human beings; and   Whereas the celebration of Vaisakhi includes performing Seva (selfless service), such as providing free meals to all visitors to Sikh Gurdwaras (Houses of Worship): Now, therefore, be it

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]wishes the Sikh American community a joyous Vaisakhi.
