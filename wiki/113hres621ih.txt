{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Reaffirming the commitment of the House of Representatives to the First Amendment to the Constitution and the vital freedom of speech protections it provides for Americans.    Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution, adopted on December 15, 1791, provides that“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances”;   Whereas the First Amendment has been and is a beacon of light and freedom to the rest of the world in its protections to the American people from overreaching by the Government;   Whereas, for more than two centuries, men and women have died to defend the Constitution and the Nation’s precious freedoms;   Whereas every member of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]takes an oath to protect and defend the Constitution;   Whereas the First Amendment provides broad freedom of speech protections to allow individuals to participate in the Nation’s representative democracy;   Whereas amending the Bill of Rights would erode those precious freedoms that strengthen the Nation’s democracy; and   Whereas the masterful design of the Nation’s Founders, in particular the authors of the First Amendment, should not be tampered with or rewritten: Now, therefore, be it
