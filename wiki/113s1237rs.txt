On March 4, 1925, by Joint Resolution of the United States Congress, American sovereignty was officially extended over Swains Island and it was placed under the jurisdiction of the government of American Samoa.
:(D) Since ratification of the Treaties of Cession, many American Samoans who are United States nationals have joined the United States Armed Forces and fought for the United States during World War II, the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf wars, and most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.
:(E) It is the responsibility of the Secretary of Interior to advance the economic, social and political development of the territories of the United States.

===(2) Purpose– ===

The purpose of this section is to provide for a federally authorized vote in American Samoa on the question of citizenship and if a majority of voters vote for citizenship, to describe the steps that the President and Congress shall take to enable American Samoans to be granted citizenship.
