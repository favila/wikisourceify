{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week beginning September 14, 2014, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week.    Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are degree-granting institutions that have a full-time equivalent undergraduate enrollment of at least 25 percent Hispanic students;   Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions play an important role in educating many underprivileged students and helping those students attain their full potential through higher education;   Whereas 370 Hispanic-Serving Institutions operate in the United States;   Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions represent just 11 percent of all institutions of higher learning, yet serve nearly 60 percent of all Hispanic students, enrolling more than 1,500,000 Hispanic students in 2012;   Whereas the number of“emerging Hispanic-Serving Institutions,”defined as institutions that do not yet meet the threshold of 25 percent Hispanic enrollment but serve a Hispanic student population of between 15 and 24 percent, grew to 270 colleges and universities in 2012;   Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are actively involved in stabilizing and improving the communities in which the institutions are located;   Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to the United States strengthens the culture of the United States; and   Whereas the achievements and goals of Hispanic-Serving Institutions deserve national recognition: Now, therefore, be it    

= =
