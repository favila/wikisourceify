{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for patient protection by establishing safe nurse staffing levels at certain Medicare providers, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Registered Nurse Safe Staffing Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Research shows that patient safety in hospitals is directly proportionate to the number of registered nurses working in the hospital. Higher staffing levels by experienced registered nurses are related to lower rates of negative patient outcomes.
:(2) A 2011 study on nurse staffing and inpatient hospital mortality shows that sub-optimal nurse staffing is linked with a greater likelihood of patient death in the hospital. A 2012 study of serious patient events reported to the Joint Commission demonstrates that one of the leading causes of all hospital sentinel events is human factors, including staffing and staffing skill mix.
:(3) Health care worker fatigue has been identified as a major patient safety hazard, and appropriate staffing policies and practices are indicated as an effective strategy to reduce health care worker fatigue and to protect patients. A national survey of registered nurses found that 74 percent experience acute or chronic effects of stress and overwork.
:(4) A strategy that ensures optimal nurse staffing and skill mix greatly influences patient satisfaction and results in greater overall savings to hospitals through reductions in adverse patient events.
:(5) A 2009 study demonstrated that improved patient satisfaction due to increased and appropriate nurse staffing is reflected on hospital scores on HCAHPS, which is a key measure for value-based payment programs under the Medicare program and used by other payors.
:(6) Registered nurses play a vital role in preventing patient care errors. A 2009 study found that sufficient staffing of critical care nurses can prevent adverse patient events, which can cost anywhere from $2,200,000 to $13,200,000. By contrast, the nurse staffing costs in the study time period were only $1,360,000.
:(7) Higher nurse staffing also generates cost savings to payors, as demonstrated in a 2011 cost-benefit analysis that weighed registered nursing personnel costs against emergency department utilization after patient discharge from a hospital.
:(8) A 2012 study of Pennsylvania hospitals shows that by reducing nurse burnout, which is attributed in part to poor nurse staffing, those hospitals could prevent an estimated 4,160 infections with an associated savings of $41,000,000. That study also found that for each additional patient assigned to a registered nurse for care, there is an incidence of roughly one additional catheter-acquired urinary tract infection per 1,000 patients or 1,351 infections per year, costing those hospitals as much as $1,100,000 annually.
:(9) When hospitals employ insufficient numbers of nursing staff, registered nurses are being required to perform professional services under conditions that do not support quality health care or a healthful work environment for registered nurses.
:(10) As a payor for inpatient and outpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, the Federal Government has a compelling interest in promoting the safety of these patients by requiring any hospital participating in the Medicare program to establish minimum safe staffing levels for registered nurses.
