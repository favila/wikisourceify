{{Center|A BILL}}

 To better connect current and former members of the Armed Forces with employment opportunities by consolidating duplicative Federal Government Internet websites into a single portal, to conserve resources by merging redundant and competing programs, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ United We Stand to Hire Veterans Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Consolidated and coordinated Federal Government Internet portal to connect current and former members of the Armed Forces with employers seeking employees with skills and experience developed through military service=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Although significant progress has been made, unemployment among veterans remains stubbornly high.
:(2) The unemployment rate among younger veterans, ages 18 to 24, remains well above the national average.
:(3) This problem impacts the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] budget. Over the past 10 years, the Federal Government has expended more than $9,600,000,000 on unemployment compensation benefits for former members of the Armed Forces.
:(4) The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] makes significant investments in members of the Armed Forces including specialized technical training in skills that are easily transferrable to civilian career fields.
:(5) Beyond specific technical training, veterans gain unique leadership, organizational, and other skills that make them valued employees in the private sector.
:(6) Government agencies, private sector entities, and nonprofit organizations are responding to the issue of unemployment among veterans.
:(7) There are now so many programs to assist veterans in finding employment, many within the Government, that veterans may not know where to turn to find assistance in finding employment. While these programs are well intentioned, many are duplicative in nature, and compete for scarce resources.
:(8) The [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] , the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] , the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] , and the [[w:Office of Personnel Management|Office of Personnel Management]] are currently working to consolidate the veterans’ employment initiatives of the Government into a single, consolidated Internet portal with the goal of connecting veterans who are seeking employment with employers who want to employ them.
:(9) The consolidated portal would prevent Federal Government agencies from competing with each other to accomplish the same goal, and will save the Federal Government money while providing a comprehensive, coordinated tool for employers and veterans seeking employment.
:(10) The Federal Government can accomplish this by leveraging the best practices of current programs.
:(11) While progress has been made, there is no statutory requirement to streamline these Government programs and coordinate the resources that are all intended to achieve the same goal.
