It shall be an affirmative defense in a civil action brought under this Act that each alleged covered trade secret in dispute was readily ascertainable through proper means by other persons who did not already know the covered trade secret at the time of any alleged misappropriation, threat to misappropriate, or conspiracy to misappropriate.

==(b) Forum non conveniens– ==

In considering a motion to dismiss or stay on forum non conveniens grounds filed in a civil action brought under this Act, a court shall—

==(c) Anti-Suit injunctions– ==

In a civil action brought under this Act, the court may enter an injunction enjoining a defendant over whom the court has personal jurisdiction from pursuing subsequently filed litigation in another jurisdiction if—

:(3) the action in the other jurisdiction threatens the jurisdiction of the court or the purposes of this Act.

==(d) Confidentiality– ==

In any proceeding relating to a civil action brought under this Act, the court shall enter any order and take any other action that is necessary and appropriate to preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets, consistent with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and all other applicable laws.

==(e) Statute of limitations– ==

A civil action brought under this Act may not be commenced later than 3 years after the date on which the conduct described in section 3(a)that forms the basis for the action was discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.

::(E) the matter to be seized is located at the place identified in the application;
::(F) the harm to the applicant that would be caused by denying the application outweighs the harm to the legitimate interests of the person against whom seizure is sought that would be caused by granting the application; and
