<blockquote> 

====(2) Reduction of credit for conversion to non-affordable units– ====

The [[w:|Director]]shall, by regulation, establish standards for the multifamily special affordable housing goal under this section that proportionately reduce the number of units receiving credit for any mortgage purchase by an enterprise that facilitates the conversion of dwelling units that, at the time of such purchase, are available for rental at rates that are affordable to low-income families to dwelling units that would not be affordable to low-income families. Such regulations shall consider and include the following factors:

=====(A) Limitation based on project debt– =====

Credit shall not be provided toward the achievement of such goal for any mortgage purchase for multifamily housing that involves an aggregate amount of project debt that is not reasonable, as determined in accordance with prudent underwriting standards established by the [[w:|Director]], in proportion to project income, as documented in accordance with the standards established under this subsection.

=====(B) Treatment of securities– =====

In the case of any purchase by an enterprise of a security, or an interest in a security, that is backed by mortgages that finance units that would otherwise qualify for credit toward the achievement of the multifamily special affordable housing goal if financed directly by the enterprise, if the [[w:|Director]]determines that such purchase may be counted toward the achievement of the goal under this section, the [[w:|Director]]shall require the enterprise to apply the same standard as set forth in subparagraph (A) with respect to mortgage purchases to the mortgages backing such security to determine whether the units financed by such mortgages are eligible for credit toward the achievement of the housing goal.

=====(C) Rent levels– =====

In measuring the performance of each enterprise in meeting the goal established under this section, rent levels for units shall be calculated by using the greater of the rent levels at the time the loan is purchased or the rent levels under the pro forma operating income statement on which the underwriting for the loan was based.

=====(D) Carryover– =====

If the [[w:|Director]]provides credit toward the achievement of the multifamily special affordable housing goal under this section, for any year, for any mortgage purchase by an enterprise, but determines at any time thereafter that, because of failure to comply with the standards established under subparagraphs (A) and (B) , such purchase does not qualify for such credit or does not qualify for such credit to the extent previously provided, the [[w:|Director]]shall increase the multifamily special housing goal for such enterprise for the current or ensuing year otherwise applicable to the extent of such nonqualification. . 
</blockquote>


==(b) Regulations– ==
