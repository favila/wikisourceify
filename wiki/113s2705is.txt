::(6) to inform and educate the public and the private sector about the progress and findings of the renewable research and development carried out pursuant to the plan.
:(b) Public hearings– In developing the plan, the [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Administrator]]shall provide public notice and opportunity for 1 or more public hearings and shall seek comments from Federal and State agencies, tribes, local governments, representatives of the private sector, and other parties interested in renewable energy observations, data, and use in order to improve [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Administration]]climate, weather, and water observation data products and services to more effectively support renewable energy development. 

=Sec. 5. Establishment of research, prediction, and environmental information program=


:(a) In general– Not later than 3 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Administrator]]shall establish a program to develop and implement an integrated and comprehensive ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmosphere research and operations program, based on the plan required by section 4 , to support renewable energy development in the United States.
:(b) Program components– At a minimum, the program required by subsection (a) shall include the following:
::(1) Improvements in coordinated climate, weather, water research, biological and technological research monitoring, and observations to support renewable energy siting and development.
::(2) Coordinated weather, water, and climate prediction capability focused on renewable energy and“smart grid”technology to provide information and decision services in support of renewable energy development.
::(3) Support for the transition to, and reliable delivery of, sustained operational weather, water, and climate products from research, observation, and prediction outputs.
::(4) Means of identifying biological and ecological effects of marine renewable energy development on living marine resources, the marine and coastal environment, marine-dependent industries, and coastal communities.
::(5) Baseline ecological characterization, including research, data collection, and mapping, of the coastal and marine environment and living marine resources for marine renewable energy development.
::(6) Avoidance, minimization, and mitigation strategies to address the potential impacts of renewable energy on the marine, coastal, and Great Lakes habitats resources and communities, including developing effective monitoring protocols, use of adaptive management, informed engineering design and operating parameters, and the establishment of protocols for minimizing the environmental impacts of testing, developing, and deploying marine renewable energy devices.
::(7) Support for the development of marine special area management plans by states as defined by the   Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972  ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1451 16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.] )that would support renewable energy development consistent with natural resource protection and other coastal-dependent economic growth.
::(8) Coordination of comprehensive digital mapping, modeling, and other geospatial information and services to support planning for renewable energy and stewardship of ecosystem and living marine ecosystems, including protected species, in ocean, Great Lakes, and coastal areas.
::(9) A coordinated approach for examining and quantifying the micro-climate impacts of wind-power farms on soil transpiration and drying.
::(10) Provision for outreach to the public and private sector about program research, information, and products, including making non-proprietary information and best management practices developed under this program available to the public.
:(c) Use in agency decisions– The program established under subsection (a) shall be designed to collect, synthesize, and distribute data in a manner that can be used by resource managers responsible for making decisions about renewable energy projects. The [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Bureau of Ocean Energy Management]], [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], and [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]shall consider this information when making planning, siting, and permitting decisions for renewable energy.
