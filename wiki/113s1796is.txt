{{Center|A BILL}}

 To increase the participation of women, girls, and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields, to encourage and support students from all economic backgrounds to pursue STEM career opportunities, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   STEM Gateways Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) According to a 2013 [[w:Bureau of the Census|Census Bureau]] study, women’s representation in STEM occupations has increased since the 1970s, but women remain significantly underrepresented in engineering and computing occupations that make up more than 80 percent of all STEM employment. Women’s representation in computer occupations has declined since the 1990s. In 2011, 26 percent of STEM workers were women. According to the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, Inc. (NACME), the number of engineering degrees awarded to African-American women has steadily declined since the late 1990s.
:(2) According to the Brookings Institution 2013 report,“The Hidden STEM Economy”, half of all STEM jobs are available to workers without a 4-year college degree, and these jobs pay $53,000 per year on average. This sector of the STEM economy offers job opportunities for many workers with qualified certificates or associate’s degrees, drawing from high schools, workforce training programs, vocational schools, and community colleges. Despite these opportunities, only1/5of the $4,300,000,000 spent annually by the Federal Government on STEM education and training goes towards supporting sub-bachelor’s level training.
:(3) According to a 2011 report by the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] , underrepresented minorities account for only 3 out of 10 professionals in STEM fields.
:(4) STEM workers in all demographic groups earn more than their non-STEM counterparts.
:(5) According to the America After 3pm report, children from African-American, Hispanic, and Native American populations participate in afterschool programs in greater numbers than the average. Girls also participate in equal numbers to boys in such programs. Afterschool learning thus represents an intervention point to engage with populations currently underrepresented in STEM fields and careers.
