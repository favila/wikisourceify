{{Center|A BILL}}

 To require the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to move United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) back to the continental United States, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Africa Counter Terrorism Initiative Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The proliferation of terrorist groups is rampant in unstable countries in West and sub-Saharan Africa. The biggest regional threats include al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has known ties to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Boko Haram, and al-Shabab. The opportunity to expand the strategic reach and force projection of the United States into the theater of operations of the United States Africa Command (in this Act referred to as“AFRICOM”) is now. With the United States strategic pivot to the Pacific now underway, the need to ensure retention of a strong Atlantic presence is a vital and delicate aspect of strategic re-positioning.
:(2) The United States Central Command operates from its headquarters in Tampa, Florida, with a forward operating location in Qatar. The [[w:United States Southern Command|United States Southern Command]]operates from its headquarters in Miami, Florida, with forward operating locations in Honduras and El Salvador. It is not unusual for United States military units and their combatant command headquarters to operate in different time zones.
:(3) Analyses conducted by the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]found that the annual recurring cost of maintaining a United States-based headquarters for AFRICOM would be $60 million to $70 million less than the cost of operating the AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. The annual cost of providing AFRICOM personnel with overseas housing and cost-of-living pay was $81 million per year, compared with the $19 million to $25 million these would cost if the personnel were located in the United States. The break-even point to recover one-time relocation costs to the United States would be reached between 2 and 6 years after relocation, depending on the costs to establish facilities in the United States. Relocating AFRICOM to the continental United States could create up to 4,300 additional jobs, with an annual impact on the local economy ranging from $350 million to $450 million.
:(4) After an internal cost assessment, the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]decided to keep AFRICOM headquarters in Stuttgart, without fully explaining why the operational benefits of keeping the headquarters in Germany outweigh the benefit of potentially saving millions of dollars per year and creating thousands of jobs in the United States.
:(5) A review by the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]in 2013 of the Department’s decision to keep AFRICOM headquarters in Germany found that the decision was not supported by comprehensive and well-documented analysis that balanced the operational and cost benefits of the options available to the Department.
:(6) In April 2013, after the decision had been made to maintain AFRICOM headquarters in Germany, [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]Chuck Hagel called on the Department to challenge all past assumptions in order to seek cost savings and efficiencies in“a time of unprecedented shifts in the world order, new global challenges, and deep global fiscal uncertainty”, to explore the full range of options for implementing United States national security strategy, and to“put everything on the table”. The Secretary stated that the size and shape of the military forces should constantly be reassessed. He stated that this reassessment should include determining the most appropriate balance between forward-stationed, ro­ta­tion­al­ly deployed, and home-based forces.
:(7) It is within the strategic and fiscal responsibility of Congress to fully analyze and provide for the implementation of any consolidation of military installations. There are more than 110,000 troops and civilians stationed and employed at 29 military installations in Europe. Priority should be given to consolidating bases that are in close proximity to each other and that can achieve cost savings without detriment to operational readiness, such as Royal Air Force Station Mildenhall and Royal Air Force Station Lakenheath, as well as Moron Air Base, Spain, and Naval Station Rota, Spain.
:(8) Of particular concern is the decision to deploy assets to Moron Air Base, where the readiness and effectiveness of deployed troops is hindered by the lack of infrastructure to house, train, and equip them. Specifically, Moron lacks the facilities to properly perform ground and naval training operations, and only has limited ability to accomplish air training operations. By contrast, Lajes Field has implemented more than $150 million of major infrastructure upgrades over the past 12 years to improve the quality of life, upgrade communication capabilities, bolster security, and enhance military operations. With a nearby port, sprawling fields, and unrestricted airspace, Lajes Field has the unique ability to host extensive air, ground, and naval training operations. Lajes’ strategic location, infrastructure improvements, unrestricted air space, and outstanding training environment for all forces make this an indispensable asset and an ideal forward operating base for AFRICOM, as opposed to spending hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade aging sites such as Moron Air Base, Spain.
:(9) It is in the national interest of the United States to save millions of dollars per year and bring thousands of jobs to the United States by moving AFRICOM headquarters from Stuttgart, Germany, to the continental United States.
