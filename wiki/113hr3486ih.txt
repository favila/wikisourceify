To empower States with authority for most taxing and spending for highway programs and mass transit programs, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Transportation Empowerment Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all States;
:(2) that objective has been attained, and the Interstate System connecting all States is near completion;
:(3) each State has the responsibility of providing an efficient transportation network for the residents of the State;
:(4) each State has the means to build and operate a network of transportation systems, including highways, that best serves the needs of the State;
:(5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of the State and acting on those needs;
:(6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the States based on the Federal Government’s perceptions of what is best for the States;
:(7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not necessarily appropriate for individual States;
:(8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive activities;
:(9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, regardless of the different circumstances of the States, cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars on projects, programs, and activities that the States would not otherwise undertake; and
:(10)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has expressed a strong interest in reducing the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to manage its own affairs.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to return to the individual States maximum discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all elements of the national surface transportation systems that are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;
:(2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways;
:(3) to preserve the responsibility of the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] for—
::(A) design, construction, and preservation of transportation facilities on Federal public land;
::(B) national programs of transportation research and development and transportation safety; and
::(C) emergency assistance to the States in response to natural disasters;
:(4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, and preservation of Federal and State transportation facilities; and
:(5) with respect to transportation activities carried out by States, local governments, and the private sector, to encourage—
::(A) competition among States, local governments, and the private sector; and
::(B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector participation, and productivity.

=Sec. 3. Funding limitation=

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] determines for any of fiscal years 2015 through 2019 that the aggregate amount required to carry out transportation programs and projects under this Act and amendments made by this Act exceeds the estimated aggregate amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for those programs and projects for the fiscal year, each amount made available for such a program or project shall be reduced by the pro rata percentage required to reduce the aggregate amount required to carry out those programs and projects to an amount equal to that available for those programs and projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the fiscal year.
