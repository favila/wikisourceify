[[w:Gene Green|Mr. Gene Green of Texas]] (for himself,

{{Center|A BILL}}

 To make the United States exclusively liable for certain claims of liability to the extent such liability is a claim for damages resulting from, or aggravated by, the inclusion of ethanol in transportation fuel.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ American Fuel Protection Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Ethanol is currently widely distributed in commerce for general use in all conventional gasoline-powered onroad and nonroad vehicles and nonroad engines in widespread use.
:(2) On November 4, 2010, The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) granted a partial waiver under the Clean Air Act to increase the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline from 10 to 15 volume percent ethanol for model year 2007 and newer motor vehicles.
:(3) On January 26, 2011, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] granted a partial waiver under the Clean Air Act to increase the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline from 10 to 15 volume percent ethanol for model year 2001 to 2006 motor vehicles.
:(4) As part of EPA’s waiver decisions, the Administrator found that the increased ethanol will not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system over the useful life of the motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine which such fuel is used.
:(5) On June 27, 2011, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] , in consultation with the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) finalized labeling requirements for all fuels distributed in commerce that exceed the 10 volume percent ethanol blending limit into gasoline to disclose to consumers that using such fuels may harm older conventional vehicles, boats, and other gasoline powered engines.
:(6) Research has raised significant questions and concerns about the effects of using higher ethanol blends on for motor vehicle and equipment engines on the performance of such engines.
:(7) Effects such as increased engine failures, decreased engine performance, increased consumer complaints, increased litigation, or other unforeseen effects could have a significant impact on interstate commerce.
:(8) Federal testing on newer motor vehicles to determine the effects on motor vehicle engines of increasing the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline was lacking in scope.
:(9) Motor vehicle manufacturers have said damage caused by use of gasoline containing 15 volume percent ethanol may not be covered by warranties, and therefore use of the fuel may void the vehicle warranty.
:(10) It is appropriate for [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to mitigate undue effects on parties engaged in interstate commerce resulting from a Federal decision to allow an increase of the current blending limit of ethanol into gasoline despite indications that the use of such fuel may cause damage to motor vehicles and equipment engines. 

=Sec. 3. Liability for claims based on damages resulting from, or aggravated by, the inclusion of ethanol in certain fuel=

A claim of liability is described in this subsection to the extent such liability is based upon damages resulting from, or aggravated by, the use of any transportation fuel (as defined in section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act ) containing ethanol in concentrations greater than 10 percent pursuant to a waiver under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act to operate an internal combustion engine.

==(c) Limit on damages– ==

Damages awarded for such a claim shall not exceed the actual damages sustained by the claimant.

==(d) Exclusive Jurisdiction– ==
