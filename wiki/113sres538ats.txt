{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the condolences of the Senate to the families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and condemning the terrorist acts of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.    Whereas James Foley and Steven Sotloff were highly respected journalists whose integrity and dedication were a credit to their profession;   Whereas James Foley and Steven Sotloff embodied the spirit of our Nation’s First Amendment liberties, including the freedom of the press;   Whereas James Foley and Steven Sotloff made significant contributions to our Nation through their courageous reporting of events in Libya, Syria, and elsewhere;   Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is a terrorist organization responsible for committing barbaric acts against United States citizens;   Whereas ISIL continues to hold hostages in blatant contravention of international law;   Whereas ISIL has committed despicable acts of violence against Iraqi Christians, forcing many to flee their ancient homeland;   Whereas ISIL has committed despicable acts of violence against Muslims who do not subscribe to ISIL’s depraved, violent, and oppressive ideology;   Whereas ISIL has threatened to decimate the ancient Yazidi population of Iraq while abducting Yazidi women and children and subjecting them to rape, forced marriage, and slavery;   Whereas ISIL has targeted many other religious and ethnic minority groups, including Turkmen populations; and   Whereas ISIL threatens to conduct terrorist attacks internationally: Now, therefore, be it
