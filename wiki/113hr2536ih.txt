{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to strengthen elementary and secondary computer science education, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Computer Science Education Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Computer science is transforming industry, creating new fields of commerce, driving innovation in all fields of science, and bolstering productivity in established economic sectors.
:(2) Computer science underpins the information technology sector of the United States, which is a significant contributor to the economic output of the United States.
:(3) The [[w:Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor Statistics]] predicts that there will be 9,200,000 jobs in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by the year 2020. Half of these, or 4,600,000 jobs, will be in computing.
:(4) The average annual salary in computer science is $76,000.
:(5) Elementary and secondary computer science education gives students a deeper knowledge of the fundamentals of computing, yielding critical thinking skills that will serve students throughout their lives in numerous fields.
:(6) Students who take the College Board’s AP computer science test are 8 times more likely to major in computer science in college. Unfortunately, the College Board reports that of the 3,400,000 AP exams given in 2011, just under 1,000,000 of those were in the sciences. About 20,000 of those were in computer science, accounting for 2 percent of the science exams and 1 percent of all AP exams. Of the 20,000 computer science AP test takers in 2011, only 4,000 were females.
:(7) In the 2012–2013 school year, only 9 states allowed computer science courses to count toward secondary school core graduation requirements, chilling student interest in computer science courses.
:(8) The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) has found that many States do not have a certification or licensure process for computer science teachers. Where processes do exist, they often have no connection to rigorous computer science content.
:(9) Computer science education has been encumbered by confusion regarding the related but distinct concepts of computer science education, technology education, and the use of technology in education.
:(10) The Association for Computing Machinery and the CSTA have established a clear 4-part, grade-appropriate framework of standards for computer science education to guide State reform efforts.
:(11) With the growing importance of computing in society, the need for students to understand the fundamentals of computing and the significant challenges elementary and secondary computer science education faces, broad support for computer science education is needed to catalyze reform.

=Sec. 3. Computer science definitions=

 Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/7801 20 U.S.C. 7801] ] )is amended—
:(1) by redesignating paragraphs (7) through (43)as paragraphs (8) through (44), respectively;
:(2) by inserting after paragraph (6)the following:

<blockquote>

===(7) Computer science– ===

The term computer science means the study of computers and algorithmic processes and includes the study of computing principles, computer hardware and software design, computer applications, and the impact of computers on society.;
</blockquote>

:(3) in paragraph (12), as so redesignated, by striking “and geography” and inserting “geography, and computer science” ; and
:(4) in subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (35), as so redesignated, by inserting “(including computer science)” after “academic subjects” .
