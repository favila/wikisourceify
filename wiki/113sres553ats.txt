{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 250th anniversary of the Hartford Courant newspaper.    Whereas the first edition of the Hartford Courant was printed on October 29, 1764;   Whereas the Hartford Courant is the oldest continuously published newspaper in the United States;   Whereas the Hartford Courant gave voice to a newfound yearning for freedom as the most circulated newspaper in the colonies during the throes of the Revolutionary War;   Whereas the Hartford Courant demonstrated leadership in actively supporting the presidential efforts of President Abraham Lincoln and his attempts to end slavery during the Civil War; and   Whereas the Hartford Courant is a 5-time finalist and 2-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for journalistic excellence: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]â€”
:(1) recognizes the significant and positive impact of the Hartford Courant throughout the history of the United States; and
:(2) acknowledges the importance of a vibrant free press to democracy.
