{{Center|A BILL}}

 To promote security, stability and good governance in Somalia through a coordinated interagency strategy that supports the consolidation of recent security and political gains in Somalia.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Somalia Stabilization Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Since the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, Somalia has struggled to rebuild a government and assert order and control over warlords, clan militias, and extremist groups.
:(2) The lack of functioning state and governing structures led to chronic humanitarian need within Somalia and enabled terrorist groups, maritime crime, illicit trafficking, and mass refugee flows to flourish.
:(3) In 2007, the Ethiopian military ousted the Islamic Courts Union and the United Nations authorized the African Union to deploy a peacekeeping force to Somalia, the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), in order to support the Transitional Federal Government to establish order in Somalia. AMISOM currently consists of troops from Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, Sierra Leone, and Uganda.
:(4) In 2008, Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (al-Shabaab) was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity by the United States Government.
:(5) In 2010, al-Shabaab took control of southern and central Somalia and instituted strict Sharia law.
:(6) In July 2010, Al-Shabaab retaliated against a contributor to AMISOM by carrying out an attack in Kampala, Uganda, which killed 74 people and injured 70 others.
:(7) In 2010, in response to growing al-Shabaab dominance and brutality, the AMISOM mandate was expanded to directly target and counter al-Shabaab in Somalia.
:(8) In 2011 and 2012, when many parts of the country were suffering from severe food insecurity and famine, al-Shabaab denied humanitarian access to its residents, resulting in the death of close to 260,000 people and acute food insecurity for millions.
:(9) In 2011, the Kenyan Defense Force joined AMISOM, to help take control of urban areas like Mogadishu and Kismayo from al-Shabaab control.
:(10) In 2012, improved security in much of urban Somalia enabled the Transitional Federal Government to complete a draft constitution and end its transitional term.
:(11) In 2012, a regionally representative Somali constituent assembly elected a new Federal parliament, which in turn elected President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.
:(12) The United States, Arab and European countries, the United Nations, and the African Union officially recognized the new Somali government, citing the process that created it as being the most credible and inclusive process to date.
:(13) On March 6, 2013, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2093, creating a new exemption to the 21-year-old arms embargo for a period of 12 months, to allow for“deliveries of weapons or military equipment or the provision of advice, assistance or training, intended solely for the development of the National Security Forces of the Federal Government of Somalia”, and calling for the training, equipping, and capacity-building of Somali Security Forces, including both its armed forces and police, with special focus on the development of infrastructure to“ensure the safe storage, registration, maintenance and distribution of military equipment,”and“procedures and codes of conduct … for the registration, distribution, use, and storage of weapons”.
:(14) On May 2, 2013, the United National Security Council passed Resolution 2102, establishing the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) under the leadership of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to support the Government of Somalia with peace-building, state-building and governance, as well as the coordination of international assistance.
:(15) Though greeted with great optimism, the Government of Somalia has run into many challenges, which has stalled its efforts to finalize the constitution, guide the structure of the new state, or provide services to the population.
:(16) President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and his government have committed to the completion of these tasks and to holding a constitutional referendum and national election by 2016.
:(17) On September 16, 2013, the international community and a high level Somali delegation endorsed a compact based on the“New Deal Strategy for Engagement in Fragile States.”Donors pledged $2,400,000,000 over three years to support Somali development priorities, including $69,000,000 from the United States.
:(18) Al Shabaab continues to use terrorist tactics to attack soft targets. On September 21–24, 2013, al-Shabaab perpetrated an attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people.
