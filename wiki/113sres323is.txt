{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of the Senate on maintaining the current annual adjustment in retired pay for members of the Armed Forces under the age of 62.Whereas it is the responsibility of Congress to get the fiscal house of government in order, and all government spending should be examined to achieve that goal;Whereas H.J. Res. 59 (113th Congress), a bipartisan budget proposal, is a first step in this direction, though it fails to address broader government spending issues;Whereas retirees from the Armed Forces, both those who served a full career and those medically retired and their survivors, have provided great service and sacrificed much for our country;Whereas H.J. Res. 59 (113th Congress)disproportionally targets these military retirees in the name of fiscal responsibility; andWhereas, while the decisions regarding future spending cuts may be difficult and painful, the solution should require contributions from all Americans: Now, therefore, be it

= =

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] thatâ€”
:(1) retirees from the Armed Forces should not unfairly bear the burden of excessive government spending;
:(2) military retirees earned the benefits they were promised upon entering the military, and it is the duty of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] to protect them; and
:(3) the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] should seek alternatives to the provisions of section 403 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013(introduced as H.J. Res. 59 (113th Congress)) before the effective date of that section and the amendments made by that section.
