==(d) General application to countries or administrative regions having nine largest markets– ==



===(1) General application– ===

In issuing rules under this section, the Commissions shall provide that a non-U.S. person in compliance with the swaps regulatory requirements of a country or administrative region that has one of the nine largest combined swap and security-based swap markets by notional amount in the calendar year preceding issuance of such rules, or other foreign jurisdiction as jointly determined by the Commissions, shall be exempt from United States swaps requirements in accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraph (2), unless the Commissions jointly determine that the regulatory requirements of such country or administrative region or other foreign jurisdiction are not broadly equivalent to United States swaps requirements.

Such criteria shall include the scope and objectives of the regulatory requirements of a country or administrative region described in paragraph (1)or other foreign jurisdiction as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by such country or administrative region or other foreign jurisdiction, and such other factors as the Commissions, by rule, jointly determine to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest.
