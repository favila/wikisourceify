 To amend the Clean Air Act to allow advanced biofuel, biomass-based diesel, and cellulosic biofuel to satisfy the mandates of the renewable fuel program only if domestically produced, to eliminate the corn ethanol mandate under such program, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Phantom Fuels Elimination Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Advanced biofuel, biomass-based diesel, and cellulosic biofuel required To be produced in the United States To satisfy renewable fuel program mandates=



==(a) Advanced biofuel– ==

   Section 211(o)(1)(B)(i) of the Clean Air Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7545 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(B)(i)] )is amended by striking“that has lifecycle”and inserting“that is produced in the United States and has lifecycle”.

<blockquote> 

====(G) Advanced biofuel– ====

For any calendar year for which the projected volume of advanced biofuel production is less than the minimum applicable volume established under paragraph (2)(B) , as determined by the Administrator based on the estimate provided under paragraph (3)(A) , not later than November 30 of the preceding calendar year, the Administrator shall reduce the applicable volume of advanced biofuel required under paragraph (2)(B) to the projected volume available during that calendar year. .
