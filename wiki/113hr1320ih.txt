=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Colon cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths and the second most common cancer for both men and women.
:(2) According to the American Cancer Society, over 50,000 people will die this year from colon cancer.
:(3) Colorectal cancer is highly treatable with appropriate screening. According to the American Cancer Society (2010 Facts & Figures), the 5-year survival rate is 90 percent for those individuals who are diagnosed at an early stage of the cancer. However, less than 40 percent of colon cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage.
:(4) The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recently estimated that approximately 2,000 deaths could be avoided if colonoscopy screening rates rose by just 10 percent.
:(5) Colonoscopies allow for simultaneous colorectal cancer screenings and detection and the removal of precancerous polyps, thus preventing cancer from developing.
:(6) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force provides an “A” rating for colorectal cancer screenings.
:(7) The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s]] colorectal cancer control program has set a target of screening 80 percent of eligible adults in certain States by 2014. The American Cancer Society and other patient advocacy groups have a target rate of 75 percent.
:(8) Only between 52 and 58 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have had any colorectal cancer screening test, despite Medicare coverage for such tests.
:(9) Only 49.3 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who are 50 to 80 years old receive colorectal cancer screenings within recommended intervals.
:(10) The [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]] notes that there is “clearly an opportunity to improve colorectal cancer screening rates in the Medicare population” .
:(11) A January 2011 study by the Colon Cancer Alliance concludes that most Americans over the age of 50—
::(A) wish a health care provider was able to sit down with them to discuss a colonoscopy before undergoing the test; and
::(B) forgo a colonoscopy due to fear of the procedure.
:(12) In February 2010, the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]] hosted a conference on colorectal cancer screening and cited patient awareness and fears as barriers to increasing colorectal cancer screening rates.
:(13) According to the [[w:Medicare Payment Advisory Commission|Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]] , colonoscopy is one of the most common procedures performed in the ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) and “the decline in payment rate for the highest volume procedures is especially a strong concern for ASCs that focus on gastroenterology” .
:(14) An Institute of Medicine study on colorectal cancer screening cited the inadequate reimbursement for preventive care services as one of the constraints limiting colorectal cancer screening rates.
:(15) Colorectal cancer screening by colonoscopy has been demonstrated to reduce Medicare costs over the long-term.
