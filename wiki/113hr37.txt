=={{anchor|H63D918A23EE244B38EAFB50616ADA0F6}}Sec. 201. Streamline Government Bureaucracy==



==={{anchor|H1A0DAC0F7C2D4ACC8F76F6220B1C00A1}}(a) Findings– ===

[[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Partially as a result of unnecessary Federal spending, the United States national debt is over $15 trillion.
:(2) Bureaucratic complexity and redundancy waste time and money for consumers, businesses, and taxpayers.
:(3) In March 2011, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] released a report entitled “Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue” that identifies areas where greater efficiencies could be found in Government operations. Some of the findings include:
::(A) Seven different Federal agencies have programs dedicated to meeting the water needs in the United States-Mexico border region.
::(B) There are 82 Federal programs dedicated to improving teacher quality.
::(C) There are 56 programs in 20 different Federal agencies designed to target financial literacy.
::(D) There are 80 Federal programs to boost transportation opportunities for disadvantaged individuals.
::(E) There are over 20 programs in seven different Federal agencies working to combat homelessness.
:(4) The [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce’s]] core business and trade functions, the [[w:Small Business Administration|Small Business Administration]], the [[w:Office of the United States Trade Representative|Office of the United States Trade Representative]], the [[w:Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]], the [[w:Overseas Private Investment Corporation|Overseas Private Investment Corporation]], and the [[w:United States Trade and Development Agency|United States Trade and Development Agency]] all serve important, but sometimes overlapping functions for consumers and businesses in the United States. Consolidating these agencies could save $3 billion and eliminate over 1,000 duplicative Federal jobs while improving the service provided to taxpayers and consumers.
:(5) The Federal Government provides important services that can be improved while saving money by consolidating and reforming Federal agencies.
