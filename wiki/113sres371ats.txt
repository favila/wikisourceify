{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Honoring the legacy and accomplishments of Jan Karski on the centennial of his birth.    Whereas Jan Karski was born on April 24, 1914, in Lodz, Poland;   Whereas Jan Karski managed to escape the Soviet massacre in the Katyn Forest in 1940, in which almost 22,000 Polish citizens lost their lives;   Whereas Jan Karski became a key emissary in the Polish underground resistance, the Home Army, against Nazi occupation;   Whereas Jan Karski risked his own life after escaping a prisoner-of-war camp, having endured Gestapo torture, to continue to act as an emissary for the Polish Underground, in order to provide critical intelligence to the Allied war effort and alert Allied governments about the Holocaust and the dire situation on the ground in German-occupied Poland;   Whereas Jan Karski traveled to Allied capitals and provided critical eyewitness testimony about the horrors of Hitler’s“Final Solution”and the extermination of Jews and others in Nazi-occupied Poland to British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden and United States President Franklin Roosevelt;   Whereas Jan Karski, after living through the atrocities of World War II, went on to earn a Ph.D. from Georgetown University in 1952;   Whereas Jan Karski became a United States citizen and taught generations of students of foreign policy at Georgetown University for 40 years, dedicating the rest of his life to strengthening the idea of tolerance and respect for different religions and cultures and ensuring that the full extent of the Nazi atrocities are never forgotten; and   Whereas Jan Karski was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously on May 29, 2012, one of the highest civilian honors in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
