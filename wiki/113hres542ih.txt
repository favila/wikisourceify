{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that United States foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority should be suspended until Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions relating to providing a monthly salary to anyone imprisoned in Israel’s prisons as a result of participation in the struggle against the Israeli occupation are repealed.    Whereas since fiscal year 2008, the annual regular-year United States bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged approximately $500 million, including annual averages of approximately $200 million in direct budgetary assistance and $100 million in non-lethal security assistance for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank;   Whereas the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]has found some glaring insufficiencies in the vetting process of the foreign aid grants to the Palestinian Authority and as such it is very easy for United States foreign aid dollars to be used to provide a monthly stipend for accused terrorists;   Whereas Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions 21 and 23 (2010) codified into law a longstanding Palestinian Authority practice of providing a monthly salary to“<nowiki>anyone imprisoned in the occupation’s [Israel’s] prisons as a result of his participation in the struggle against the occupation.</nowiki>”; and   Whereas, according to the Palestinian Authority’s definition, more than 4,500 Palestinian prisoners as of December 2012 are serving time for terror-related offenses and are recipients of salaries allocated from the Palestinian Authority’s general salary budget that range from 2,400 to 12,000 shekels ($680 to $3,400) a month: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]that United States foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority should be suspended until Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions 21 and 23 (2010) are repealed.
