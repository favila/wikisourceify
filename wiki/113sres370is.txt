Whereas, on February 26–27, 2014, armed men in unmarked military uniforms seized key strategic objects in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“Crimea”) in Ukraine, including the building of the Crimean Parliament and airports;   Whereas, as of March 4, 2014, the Government of Ukraine confirms that there are approximately 16,000 Russian troops occupying Crimea;   Whereas, on February 28, 2014, President
[[w:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]]stated that the United States is“deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine”and that it“would be a clear violation of Russia’s commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and borders of Ukraine, and of international law”;   Whereas President
[[w:Barack Obama|Obama]]pledged that“the United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine”;   Whereas the armed forces of the Russian Federation have violated Ukrainian sovereignty, violated international law, threatened the stability of Ukraine and the European continent, and compelled the [[w:NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]( [[w:NATO|NATO]]) to meet in emergency session to consider threats to Poland and other NATO members states; and   Whereas President
[[w:Barack Obama|Obama]]has announced his intention to work with [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]to respond forcefully to the outrageous and dangerous misbehavior of the Government of the Russian Federation: Now, therefore, be it
