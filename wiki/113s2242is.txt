{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish the prudential regulator of community and independent depository institutions as the conduit and arbiter of all Federal financial oversight, examination, and reporting.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Community Financial Protection Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) On October 3, 2013, Jerome H. Powell, member of the [[w:|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], told the Conference of State Bank Supervisors that“community bankers, who played no part in causing the financial crisis, have been forced to fight to ensure that they are not swept up in the torrent of costly new regulations”.
:(2) The profitability, and even survival, of credit unions and community and independent depository institutions is threatened by the material rise in costs of compliance, which are largely driven by resources and personnel necessary to interact with a greater number of Federal regulators and respond to an ever-growing list of required reports and special data requests. 

=Sec. 3. Prudential regulator as conduit for report requests=

   Section 1026(b) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5516 12 U.S.C. 5516(b)] )is amended to read as follows:
