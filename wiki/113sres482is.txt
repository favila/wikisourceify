{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate that the area between the intersections of International Drive, Northwest and Van Ness Street, Northwest and International Drive, Northwest and International Place, Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, should be designated as“Liu Xiaobo Plaza”.    Whereas June 4, 2014, marked the 25th anniversary of the brutal crackdown on protestors at Tiananmen Square in Beijing;   Whereas Dr. Liu Xiaobo is a Chinese human rights activist and Nobel Laureate who is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence for inciting subversion against the Government of the People’s Republic of China;   Whereas in recognition of Dr. Liu Xiaobo’s long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in the People's Republic of China, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 2010; and   Whereas renaming a portion of the street in front of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the District of Columbia after Dr. Liu Xiaobo serves as an expression of solidarity between the people of the United States and the people of the People's Republic of China who are, like Dr. Liu Xiaobo, engaged in a long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights: Now, therefore, be it
