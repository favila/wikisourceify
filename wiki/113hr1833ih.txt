{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to add gender-responsive services to the list of authorized grant purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title; Findings=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“ Improving the Juvenile Justice System for Girls Act of 2013 ”.

==(b) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) The proportion of girls entering the justice system has increased steadily over the past several decades, rising from 20 percent in 1980 to 30 percent in 2009. Most of these girls, up to 73 percent, have histories of physical and sexual violence, and their entry into the criminal and juvenile justice system is linked to their sexual and physical victimization.
:(2) Girls’ pathways into juvenile justice involvement are distinct from boys’ pathways. Girls account for a much larger proportion of nonviolent status offenders than delinquency offenders (40 percent compared to 14 percent, respectively).
:(3) A study by the Oregon Social Learning Center found the average reported age of first sexual encounter for girls in juvenile justice is 6.75.
:(4) The trauma of untreated physical and sexual abuse results in lifetime consequences for girls. These consequences include a higher risk for a number of negative social and health outcomes such as higher mortality rates, a variety of psychiatric problems, dysfunctional and violent relationships, poor educational achievement, less stable work histories, increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases and early pregnancy, substance abuse or addiction, and increased reliance on social services as compared to non-delinquent girls.
:(5) A growing body of evidence suggests that girls who enter the juvenile justice system have equal if not higher rates of mental health issues than boys who enter the system.
:(6) Current research and data have shown that gender-responsive, strength-based programming providing trauma-informed care and trauma-specific services is the most effective means of preventing juvenile offenses and reducing recidivism.
