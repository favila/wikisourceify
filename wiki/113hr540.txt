				methods of increasing ICT asset and related infrastructure utilization;

(iv)
ICT and related infrastructure power
				management;

(v)
building information modeling, including
				building energy management; and

In
				general
Not later than 180
				days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the [[Office of Management and Budget|Director]], in
				consultation with the [[United States Department of Energy|Secretary]], shall establish performance goals for
				evaluating the efforts of Federal agencies in improving the maintenance,
				purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information and
				communications technology systems and practices.

(B)
Energy efficient
				data centers
The [[Office of Management and Budget|Director]]
				shall include within the performance goals established under this
				paragraph—
(i)
specifications and benchmarks that will
				enable Federal data center operators to make more informed decisions about the
				energy efficiency and cost savings of data centers, including an overall
				Federal target for increased energy efficiency, with initial reliance on the
				Power Usage Effectiveness metric;

(ii)
overall ICT asset utilization and related
				infrastructure utilization; and

(iii)
recommendations and best practices for how
				the benchmarks will be attained, with such recommendations to include a
				requirement for agencies to evaluate the use of energy savings performance
				contracting as a preferred acquisition method for data center
				efficiency.


(C)
Administration
The
				performance goals established under this paragraph shall—
(i)
measure
				information technology costs over a specific time period of 3 to 5
				years;

(ii)
measure cost
				savings attained via the use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information
				and communications solutions during the same time period; and

(iii)
provide, to the
				maximum extent practicable, a complete picture of all costs and savings,
				including energy costs and savings.



(4)
Federal data
				centers task force
The
				[[Office of Management and Budget|Director]] shall maintain a Government-wide Data Center Task Force comprised of
				Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability
				officers. The members of such task force shall be responsible for working
				together to share progress toward individual agency goals and the overall
				Federal target for increased energy efficiency, and shall regularly exchange
				best practices and other strategic information related to energy efficiency
				with the private sector.

(5)
Reports
(A)
Agency
				reports
Each Federal agency subject to the requirements of this
				subsection shall include in the report of the agency under section 527 of the
				Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007
 (42 U.S.C. 17143
)
 a description of
				the efforts and results of the agency under this subsection.

(B)
OMB Government
				efficiency reports and scorecards
Effective beginning not later
				than October 1, 2013, the [[Office of Management and Budget|Director]] shall include in the annual report and
				scorecard of the [[Office of Management and Budget|Director]] required under section 528 of the Energy Independence
				and Security Act of 2007
 (42 U.S.C. 17144
)
 a description of the efforts and
				results of Federal agencies under this
				subsection.
