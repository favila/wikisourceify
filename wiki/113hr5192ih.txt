:(2) the amount and source of the funds and positions saved;
:(3) the specific positions, rate, amounts, and sources of funds the agency or the judicial branch wishes to include in its incentive expenditures;
:(4) how the agency or the judicial branch will meet the goals and objectives established in its strategic plans;
:(5) how the agency or the judicial branch will meet performance standards, including those in its performance plans; and
:(6) any other incentive expenditures which the agency or the judicial branch believes will enhance its performance.

==(c) Submission to Congress– ==
