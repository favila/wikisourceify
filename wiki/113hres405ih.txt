{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commending the Patriot Guard Riders for their mission to show sincere respect for fallen members of the Armed Forces by attending the funeral services of a fallen member as invited guests of the family of the member.    Whereas the Patriot Guard Riders were founded in 2005 in Mulvane, Kansas, with a mission to show sincere respect for fallen members of the Armed Forces by attending their funeral services as invited guests of a member’s family;   Whereas the Patriot Guard Riders have over 220,000 members nationwide from all walks of life;   Whereas the Patriot Guard Riders shield the mourning family and friends from interruptions created by any protestor or group of protestors;   Whereas the Patriot Guard Riders engage only in respectful acts in honor of fallen members of the Armed Forces;   Whereas the members of the Patriot Guard Riders willingly give their time, energy, and money to respect the memory of fallen members of the Armed Forces;   Whereas the men and women of the Armed Forces who fight to preserve freedom deserve the utmost respect and support of the American people; and   Whereas the Patriot Guard Riders provide a unique service that honors fallen members of the Armed Forces and their families: Now, therefore, be it    

= =
