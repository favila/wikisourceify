:(3) identify high-performance attributes of infrastructure projects described under subsection (a) that demonstrate how projects seek to advance existing statutory and policy objectives, thereby facilitating a more efficient review and permitting process;
:(4) create a process to invite Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal governments to participate in the review process, expand coordination with such agencies and governments, and require the identification as early as practicable in the process of any—
::(A) Federal agency or State, local, or tribal government with jurisdiction over the project or required by law to conduct or issue a review or make a determination with regard to the project; and

:(9) ensure that documents developed under the procedures are adopted and used by other Federal agencies, and State, local, and tribal governments, to the maximum extent practicable, to eliminate redundancy and duplicative reviews;
:(10) include improvements to mitigation policies to provide added predictability, facilitate landscape-scale mitigation based on conservation plans and regional environmental assessments, facilitate interagency mitigation plans where appropriate, ensure accountability and long-term effectiveness of mitigation activities, and utilize innovative mechanisms where appropriate; and
