=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) According to the Government of Haiti, more than 316,000 people died as a result of the earthquake that struck 15 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince on January 12, 2010, including 103 citizens of the United States and more than 100 United Nations personnel.
:(2) According to the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration, an estimated 3,000,000 people were directly affected by the disaster, and more than 2,100,000 people were displaced from their homes.
:(3) The Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and others estimated that damage and economic losses totaled $7,804,000,000, approximately 120 percent of Haiti’s gross domestic product in 2009.
:(4) The initial emergency response of the men and women of the United States Government, led by the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]] and the United States Southern Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United States, was swift and resolute.
:(5) According to the Government of Haiti, numerous multilateral agencies such as the United Nations, and international nongovernmental organizations, Haiti faces an ongoing food crisis as a result of the earthquake and subsequent damage caused by tropical storms and hurricanes, as well as long-term neglect of the agriculture sector.
:(6) According to the International Organization for Migration, approximately 320,000 people remain in spontaneous and organized camps in Haiti, and reports by the [[w:Government Accountability Office|General Accountability Office]] , the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Inspector General for the United States Agency for International Development]] , and civil society organizations indicate that the pace of recovery and development has lagged significantly behind the emergency relief phase.
:(7) On October 21, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was detected and according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population, as of February 17, 2013, more than 8,000 people had died from cholera and more than 647,500 had been infected with the disease.
:(8) The United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti estimates that, including donor pledges and other support, approximately $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed, with an additional amount of $3,800,000,000 committed, to assist in Haiti’s recovery and development.
:(9) The United States Government has appropriated approximately $3,600,000,000 for relief, recovery, and development in Haiti since the earthquake, of which $2,600,000,000 had been disbursed as of March 2013. The United States Government has also provided more than $95,000,000 in aid to combat the cholera epidemic and care for the victims.
:(10) Significant challenges remain in Haiti, which will require continued recovery and development aid from the international community for the foreseeable future.
:(11) The Haitian diaspora has also played an essential role in Haiti’s reconstruction, and the United States Government should take steps to increase outreach and encourage participation by Haitian Americans in recovery and development activities in Haiti.
