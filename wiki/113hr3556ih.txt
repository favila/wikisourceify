{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish a program to assist in the importation and care of abused, injured, or abandoned nonhuman primates.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Humane Care for Primates Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Nonhuman primates, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, macaques, and numerous other species, often face abusive and cruel captive conditions in other countries.
:(2) There is growing evidence that, absent a suitable humane alternative, these primates will remain or be placed in other cruel captive conditions and face inhumane deaths in areas outside the United States.
:(3) Regulations of the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]allow importation of nonhuman primates only for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes and not for humane lifetime shelter and care in appropriate primate sanctuaries.
:(4) Many of these animals could be obtained by certified primate sanctuaries in the United States and provided with shelter and care for the remainder of their natural lives in a species-appropriate, humane environment if allowed by law to be imported for such purpose. 

=Sec. 3. Definitions=

In this Act:
:(1) The term certified primate sanctuary means a primate sanctuary that has been certified by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]pursuant to section 4 .
:(2) The term nonhuman primates means the species included in the biological order Primates, except Homo sapiens.
:(3) The term primate sanctuary means a facility that—
::(A) rescues and provides lifetime shelter and care for animals that have been abused, injured, or abandoned, or are otherwise in need;
::(B) is an organization described in  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501 section 501(c)(3)]of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code ;
::(C) does not commercially trade in any animals, including animal parts, animal byproducts, and animal offspring;
::(D) does not intentionally breed or propagate nonhuman primates;
::(E) does not allow direct contact between the public and nonhuman primates;
::(F) does not allow unescorted public visitation at the facility, except for discrete, nonintrusive observation by individuals approved by the sanctuary;
::(G) does not allow animals to be removed from the facility, or from the animals’ enclosures, for exhibition or education; and
::(H) does not conduct research on animals, except where the facility determines that—
:::(i) the health and welfare of the animal involved is best served by participating in a treatment study; and
:::(ii) the facility reasonably believes that the outcome of the study will provide a tangible benefit to the animal involved.
:(4) The term Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 

=Sec. 4. Importation of nonhuman primates=
