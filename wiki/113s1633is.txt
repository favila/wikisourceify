{{Center|A BILL}}

 To suspend temporarily the duty on certain footwear, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Affordable Footwear Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Average collected duties on imported footwear are among the highest of any product sector, totaling approximately $2,300,000,000 in 2011 and approximately $2,500,000,000 in 2012.
:(2) Duty rates on imported footwear are among the highest imposed by the United States Government, with some as high as the equivalent of 67.5 percent ad valorem.
:(3) The duties currently imposed by the United States were set in an era during which high rates of duty were intended to protect production of footwear in the United States.
:(4) Footwear produced in the United States supplies only about 1 percent of the total United States market for footwear. This production is concentrated in distinct product groupings, which are not affected by the provisions of this Act.
:(5) Footwear duties, which are higher on lower-price footwear, serve no purpose and are a hidden, regressive tax on those people in the United States least able to pay.
:(6) Low- and moderate-income families spend a larger share of their disposable income on footwear than higher-income families.
:(7) The outdoor industry develops innovative and high performance footwear that promotes healthy and active lifestyles through outdoor recreation. 

=Sec. 3. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) there is no production in the United States of many footwear articles;
:(2) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles will not negatively affect manufacturing or employment in the United States; and
:(3) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles will result in reduced retail prices for a wide range of consumers. 

=Sec. 4. Determination of constituent material of certain footwear=

Additional U.S. Notes to chapter 64 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States are amended by striking Additional U.S. Note 5 and inserting the following:

<blockquote> 
:5. For the purposes of determining the constituent material of the outer sole pursuant to Note 4(b) of this chapter, the constituent material of an outer sole consisting of rubber or plastics to which textile materials are attached or into which such materials are otherwise incorporated shall be deemed to be only rubber or plastics, and no account shall be taken of the textile materials. . 
</blockquote>
 

=Sec. 5. Modification of article description for certain waterproof footwear=

Subheading 6401.92.60 of chapter 64 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended by adding at the end of the article description the following:“, with no portion of the soles and uppers exceeding 3.5 mm in thickness”. 

=Sec. 6. Temporary suspension or reduction of duties on certain footwear=
