{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide direction to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the establishment of standards for emissions of any greenhouse gas from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Electricity Security and Affordability Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Standards of performance for new fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units=



==(a) Limitation– ==

The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]may not issue, implement, or enforce any proposed or final rule under  section 111 of the Clean Air Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7411 42 U.S.C. 7411] )that establishes a standard of performance for emissions of any greenhouse gas from any new source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit unless such rule meets the requirements under subsections (b) and (c) .

==(b) Requirements– ==

In issuing any rule under  section 111 of the Clean Air Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7411 42 U.S.C. 7411] )establishing standards of performance for emissions of any greenhouse gas from new sources that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]](for purposes of establishing such standards)—
:(1) shall separate sources fueled with coal and natural gas into separate categories; and
:(2) shall not set a standard based on the best system of emission reduction for new sources within the coal category unless—
::(A) such standard has been achieved on average for at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding planned outages) by each of at least 6 units within such category—
:::(i) each of which is located at a different electric generating station in the United States;
:::(ii) which, collectively, are representative of the operating characteristics of electric generation at different locations in the United States; and
:::(iii) each of which is operated for the entire 12-month period on a full commercial basis; and
::(B) no results obtained from any demonstration project are used in setting such standard.

==(c) Coal having a heat content of 8300 or less British Thermal Units per pound– ==



===(1) Separate subcategory– ===

In carrying out subsection (b)(1) , the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]shall establish a separate subcategory for new sources that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units using coal with an average heat content of 8300 or less British Thermal Units per pound.

===(2) Standard– ===

Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) , in issuing any rule under  section 111 of the Clean Air Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7411 42 U.S.C. 7411] )establishing standards of performance for emissions of any greenhouse gas from new sources in such subcategory, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]shall not set a standard based on the best system of emission reduction unless—
:(A) such standard has been achieved on average for at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding planned outages) by each of at least 3 units within such subcategory—
::(i) each of which is located at a different electric generating station in the United States;
::(ii) which, collectively, are representative of the operating characteristics of electric generation at different locations in the United States; and
::(iii) each of which is operated for the entire 12-month period on a full commercial basis; and
:(B) no results obtained from any demonstration project are used in setting such standard. 

=Sec. 3. Congressional approval required for standards of performance for existing, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units=



==(a) Applicability– ==

This section applies with respect to any rule or guidelines issued by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]under  section 111 of the Clean Air Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7411 42 U.S.C. 7411] )that—
:(1) establish any standard of performance for emissions of any greenhouse gas from any modified or reconstructed source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit; or
:(2) apply to the emissions of any greenhouse gas from an existing source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit.

==(b) Congressional approval– ==

A rule or guidelines described in subsection (a) shall not take effect unless a Federal law is enacted specifying such rule’s or guidelines’ effective date.

==(c) Reporting– ==

A rule or guidelines described in subsection (a) shall not take effect unless the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]has submitted to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]a report containing each of the following:
:(1) The text of such rule or guidelines.
:(2) The economic impacts of such rule or guidelines, including the potential effects on—
::(A) economic growth, competitiveness, and jobs in the United States; and
::(B) electricity ratepayers, including low-income ratepayers in affected States.
:(3) The amount of greenhouse gas emissions that such rule or guidelines are projected to reduce as compared to overall global greenhouse gas emissions. 

=Sec. 4. Repeal of earlier rules and guidelines=

The following rules and guidelines shall be of no force or effect, and shall be treated as though such rules and guidelines had never been issued:
:(1) The proposed rule—
::(A) entitled“Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units”, published at 77 Fed. Reg. 22392 (April 13, 2012); and
::(B) withdrawn pursuant to the notice entitled“Withdrawal of Proposed Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units”, signed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on September 20, 2013, and identified by docket ID number EPA–HQ–OAR–2011–0660.
:(2) The proposed rule entitled“Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units”, signed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on September 20, 2013, and identified by docket ID number EPA–HQ–OAR–2013–0495.
:(3) With respect to the proposed rule described in paragraph (1) , any successor or substantially similar proposed or final rule that—
::(A) is issued prior to the date of the enactment of this Act;
::(B) is applicable to any new source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit; and

::(A) are issued prior to the date of the enactment of this Act; and
::(B) establish any standard of performance for emissions of any greenhouse gas from any modified or reconstructed source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit or apply to the emissions of any greenhouse gas from an existing source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit.
