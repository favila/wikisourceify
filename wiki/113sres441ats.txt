{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week of May 1 through May 7, 2014, as“National Physical Education and Sport Week”.    Whereas according to the 2012 Shape of the Nation Report, there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in the United States over the last 20 years, and obesity rates are high;   Whereas over 30 percent of children in the United States are overweight or obese;   Whereas according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], over 48 percent of high school students do not attend physical education classes in an average week;   Whereas according to Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 17 should engage in 60 minutes or more of physical activity daily, including aerobic, muscle strengthening, and bone strengthening exercises;   Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to the continued health and well-being of children; and   Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]strongly supports efforts to increase physical activity and participation of children and youth in sports: Now, therefore, be it
