={{anchor|H1DBEF4F3FF814F7E927DF82EC16491CA}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Security Clearance Protection Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H176631E7386549A7A73A2556D6A8A339}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On March 1, 2013, pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, across-the-board spending cuts went into effect, triggering a massive cut in Federal discretionary spending across each Federal department and agency until $1.2 trillion in savings is achieved.
:(2) The impact of the cuts from sequestration will be significant and will affect many civilian employees who work for the Federal Government, some of whom handle classified materials to protect national security.
:(3) To absorb such budget cuts, Federal department and agencies will furlough many civilian employees for up to 22 days a year.
:(4) Some civilian employees will incur financial hardships and may not be able to meet their financial obligations due to loss of pay.
:(5) Sequestration and employee furloughs are a result of circumstances outside of the control of Federal employees and no fault of their own.

={{anchor|HA11815EC98924DD2859AEA22B6B837DF}}Sec. 3. No effect on access to classified information due to sequestration=

The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] shall ensure that, if any financial hardship is incurred by a civilian employee of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] due to a furlough as a result of sequestration under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, that financial hardship will not affect the employee’s—
:(1) eligibility for continued suitability for employment by the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] ;
:(2) access to classified information; or
:(3) suitability to hold a position critical to national security.
