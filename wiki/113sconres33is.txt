{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the enactment of the Smith-Lever Act, which established the nationwide Cooperative Extension System.    Whereas May 8, 2014, marks the centennial of the enactment of the  Smith-Lever Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/341 7 U.S.C. 341 et seq].), which established the Cooperative Extension System, the nationwide transformative education system operating through land-grant colleges and universities (as defined in section  1404 of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/3103 7 U.S.C. 3103] )) in partnership with Federal, State, and local governments;   Whereas Senator Michael Hoke Smith of Georgia and Representative Asbury Francis Lever of South Carolina authored the  Smith-Lever Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/341 7 U.S.C. 341 et seq].)to bring the research-based knowledge of land-grant colleges and universities to individuals where the individuals live and work;   Whereas the first section of the  Smith-Lever Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/341 7 U.S.C. 341] )states that the purpose of the Act is“to aid in diffusing among the people of the United States useful and practical information on subjects relating to agriculture, uses of solar energy with respect to agriculture, home economics, and rural energy, and to encourage the application of the same”through extension work carried out by the land-grant colleges and universities;   Whereas cooperative extension work is a critical component of the three-part mission of the land-grant colleges and universities to work collaboratively with research institutions, in particular the State agriculture experiment stations and 106 colleges and universities, in each State of the United States, the District of Columbia, and each territory or possession of the United States, including— 
:(1) part B institutions (as defined in  section 322 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1061 20 U.S.C. 1061] )); 
:(2) 1994 Institutions (as defined in  section 532 of the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/301  7 U.S.C. 301note]; [[Public Law 103-382|Public Law 103–382]]  ); and 
:(3) Hispanic-serving institutions (as defined in  section 1404 of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/3103 7 U.S.C. 3103] ));   Whereas research-based education provided through the Cooperative Extension System to farmers and ranchers helped establish the United States as a leading agricultural-producing nation in the world;   Whereas, in 1924, the clover emblem was adopted by the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]to represent the 4–H Clubs through which the nationwide youth development program of the Cooperative Extension System is carried out;   Whereas, since 1924, 4–H Clubs have prepared millions of youth for responsible adulthood;   Whereas cooperative extension activities— 
:(1) prepare individuals for healthy, productive lives via sustained education, such as the nutrition education program established under  section 1425 of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/3175 7 U.S.C. 3175] ); 
:(2) help to break the cycle of poverty; and 
:(3) reduce the expenditures of Federal and State assistance programs;   Whereas educational activities carried out under the  Smith-Lever Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/341 7 U.S.C. 341 et seq].)provide rapid response to disasters and emergencies, such as through the Extension Disaster Education Network and other similar efforts, by providing real-time alerts and resources so that educators can respond to urgent needs resulting from hurricanes, floods, oil spills, fire, drought, pest outbreaks, and infectious diseases affecting humans, livestock, and crops;   Whereas cooperative extension activities translate science-based research for practical application through local and online learning networks in which educators are uniquely available to identify emerging research questions, connect with land-grant college or university faculty to find answers, and encourage the application of the findings of that research to improve economic and social conditions;   Whereas cooperative extension activities engage with rural and urban learners through practical, community-based, and online approaches resulting in the acquisition of the knowledge, skills, and motivation necessary to strengthen the profitability of animal and plant production systems, protect natural resources, help individuals make healthy lifestyle choices, ensure a safe and abundant food supply, encourage community vitality, and grow the next generation of leaders; and   Whereas many States are celebrating the centennial of the enactment of the  Smith-Lever Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/341 7 U.S.C. 341 et seq].)with resolutions and proclamations, and many land-grant colleges and universities are also commemorating the enactment of that historic Act: Now, therefore, be it

:(2) encourages the people of the United States to observe and celebrate the centennial with a focus on launching an innovative and sustainable future for the Cooperative Extension System;
