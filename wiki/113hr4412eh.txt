===Sec. 212. Barriers impeding enhanced utilization of the ISS’s National Laboratory by commercial companies===



====(a) Sense of congress– ====

It is the sense of Congress that—
:(1) enhanced utilization of the International Space Station’s National Laboratory requires a full understanding of the barriers impeding such utilization and actions needed to be taken to remove or mitigate them to the maximum extent practicable; and

Consistent with the findings and recommendations of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Columbia Accident Investigation Board]], the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]shall—
:(1) ensure that, in its evaluation and selection of contracts for the development of commercial crew transportation capabilities, safety is the highest priority; and
:(2) seek to ensure that minimization of the probability of loss of crew shall be an important selection criterion of the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability Contract.

====(d) Cost minimization– ====

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall strive through the competitive selection process to minimize the life cycle cost to the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]through the planned period of commercially provided crew transportation services.

====(e) Transparency– ====

Transparency is the cornerstone of ensuring a safe and reliable commercial crew transportation service to the International Space Station.

==Sec. 719. Restoring commitment to engineering research==



===(a) Sense of congress– ===

It is the sense of Congress that engineering excellence has long been a hallmark of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration’s]]ability to make significant advances in aeronautics and space exploration. However, as has been noted in recent National Academies reports, increasingly constrained funding and competing priorities have led to an erosion of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration’s]]commitment to basic engineering research. This research provides the basis for the technology development that enables the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration’s]]many challenging missions to succeed. If current trends continue, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration’s]]ability to attract and maintain the best and brightest engineering workforce at its Centers as well as its ability to remain on the cutting edge of aeronautical and space technology will continue to erode and will threaten the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]’s ability to be a world leader in aeronautics research and development and space exploration.

===(b) Plan– ===

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall develop a plan for restoring a meaningful basic engineering research program at the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]’s Centers, including, as appropriate, collaborations with industry, universities, and other relevant organizations. The plan shall identify the organizational approach to be followed, an initial set of basic research priorities, and a proposed budget.

===(c) Report– ===

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall transmit the plan specified in subsection (b) to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]].

It is the sense of Congress that—
:(1) the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]plays a key role in demonstrating the feasibility of using robotic technologies for a spacecraft that could autonomously access, inspect, repair, and refuel satellites;
:(2) demonstrating this feasibility would both assist the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]in its future missions and provide other Federal agencies and private sector entities with enhanced confidence in the feasibility to robotically refuel, inspect, repair, and maintain their satellites in both near and distant orbits; and
:(3) the capability to refuel, inspect, repair, and maintain satellites robotically could add years of functional life to satellites.

===(b) Report– ===

Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall transmit a report to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]]describing the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration’s]]—
:(1) activities, tools, and techniques associated with the ultimate goal of autonomously servicing satellites using robotic spacecraft;
:(2) efforts to coordinate its technology development and demonstrations with other Federal agencies and private sector entities that conduct programs, projects, or activities on on-orbit satellite inspection and servicing capabilities;
:(3) efforts to leverage the work of these Federal agencies and private sector entities into the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration’s]]plans;
:(4) accomplishments to date in demonstrating various servicing technologies;
:(5) major technical and operational challenges encountered and mitigation measures taken; and
