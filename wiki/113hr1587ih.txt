==(b) Terms and Conditions– ==

A permit issued under this section shall be consistent with the laws and regulations generally applicable to utility rights-of-way within the respective eligible Federal land and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate.

:(C) The public or economic purpose served by the pipeline and its related facility.
