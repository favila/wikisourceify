[[w:Bobby Rush|Mr. Rush]](for himself,

[[w:Bill Johnson (Ohio politician)|Mr. Johnson of Ohio]]) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]] }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To require the Secretary of Energy to establish and carry out a comprehensive program to improve education and training for energy-related jobs.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   21st Century Energy Workforce Development Jobs Initiative Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) There are, currently and for well into the future, significant opportunities for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans throughout the energy industry at each level of education and training, but raising the educational achievement for large segments of the upcoming generation is resource intensive and will take decades to achieve, although the payoff of an increased skilled labor pool would be enormous to society in general and United States industry in particular.
:(2) African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans represent an important talent pool to help meet the demands of the projected growth in the energy industry, and workforce training and education in business, finance, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will prove vital in achieving this growth, as noted by the American Petroleum Institute.
:(3) Improving minority preparation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics related disciplines at the primary and secondary school levels is crucial to increasing the share of minority science-based degree attainment in 4-year and 2-year programs of higher education, as well as for increasing attainment of vocational certificates.
:(4) The rates at which African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans attain employment in the energy industry is in part related to the choice of the field of study for college degrees (4-year or 2-year) and vocational certificates.
:(5) Data from the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]]suggest that, over the 2001 through 2010 period, African-American and Hispanic-American students chose and completed 4-year college degrees applicable to employment in the oil and natural gas industry at rates one-fifth and one-half, respectively, the rates of the total student population.
:(6) With respect to 2-year associate degrees and certificates, data from the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]]suggest that over the same time period, African-American and Hispanic-American students chose and completed programs of study/training applicable to employment in the oil and natural gas industry at rates roughly one-tenth above and one-third below, respectively, the rates of the total student population.
:(7) The American Petroleum Institute projects 525,000 new job opportunities in the oil and natural gas industry by 2020, with 166,000, or 31 percent of such jobs, expected to be held by African-American and Hispanic-American workers, and, with forward looking policies, that number could increase to a projected 811,000 new job opportunities, with more than 285,000, or 35 percent, of such jobs being filled by minorities, by 2030.
:(8) The American Petroleum Institute projects that more than 50 percent of all jobs created in the oil and natural gas industry by 2020 would be high-paying skilled and semiskilled blue collar jobs, with a significant range of opportunities at the scientific/managerial level requiring a college degree.
:(9) The American Petroleum Institute projects that over half of the future potential job growth in the oil and natural gas industry, approximately 417,000 jobs, is expected in the Gulf region, with the East region expected to contribute nearly 140,000 job opportunities, the Rockies region nearly 116,000 job opportunities, and the West, Alaska, and Central regions expected to contribute approximately 138,000 job opportunities combined.
:(10) The National Mining Association reports that the coal mining industry supported a total of 805,680 jobs in 2011. That includes 204,580 direct jobs, including mine workers (143,520), support activities (7,280), and transportation (53,780).
:(11) Broad occupational categories of potential job creation in the upstream oil and gas industry include—
::(A) management, business, and financial jobs;
::(B) professional and related jobs;
::(C) service jobs;
::(D) sales and related jobs;
::(E) office and administrative support jobs;
::(F) skilled blue collar jobs;
::(G) semiskilled blue collar jobs; and
::(H) unskilled blue collar jobs.
:(12) Potential job creation in the upstream oil and gas industry by selected detailed occupational category include—
::(A) derrick, rotary drill, and service unit operators;
::(B) oil and gas roustabouts;
::(C) operating engineers and other construction workers;
::(D) equipment operators;
::(E) construction laborers;
::(F) first-line supervisors/managers of construction and extraction workers;
::(G) heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers;
::(H) pump operators and wellhead pumpers;
::(I) helpers and other extraction workers;
::(J) petroleum engineers; and
::(K) secretaries.
:(13) The National Petroleum Council estimates that over the next decade 30,000 miles of new long-distance natural gas pipelines will be needed to manage the new sources of shale natural gas supply, while a 2007 Census Bureau’s Survey of Business Owners estimated that a very small percentage of pipelines were owned by minority-owned and woman-owned firms compared to the total owned by nonminority males.
:(14) In 2013, the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]]estimated that relatively low natural gas prices, maintained by growing shale natural gas production, will spur increased use of natural gas in the industrial and electric power sectors by 16 percent, from 6.8 trillion cubic feet per year in 2011 to 7.8 trillion cubic feet per year in 2025, while total consumption of natural gas in the United States will continue to grow in the electric power sector from 16 percent of generation in 2000 to 30 percent in 2040, which will lead to a significant number of new jobs in the natural gas sector.
:(15) The [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]]estimates natural gas production in the United States will increase annually, outpacing domestic consumption and making the United States a net exporter of natural gas by 2019, while continued low levels of liquefied natural gas imports, combined with increased United States exports of domestically sourced liquefied natural gas, position the United States as a net exporter of liquefied natural gas by 2016, creating an abundance of new jobs and investment opportunities.
:(16) The [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]]estimates that coal-fired electricity generation will remain a dominant resource in the Nation’s total generation portfolio, representing 34 percent of United States baseload electricity in 2035.
:(17) In 2013, a report by the Bloomberg New Energy Finance research team estimated that clean energy investment is most likely to grow by 230 percent to a projected $630 billion annually in 2030, driven by further improvements in the cost-competitiveness of wind and solar technologies and an increase in the roll-out of non-intermittent clean energy sources including hydropower, geothermal, and biomass, requiring additional investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education.
:(18) A 2013 report by the Bloomberg New Energy Finance research team estimated that renewable energy projects including wind, solar, hydropower, and biomass will account for 70 percent of new power generation capacity between 2012 and 2030, and, by 2030, renewable energy will account for half of the generation capacity worldwide, up from 28 percent in 2012, requiring additional investment in supporting infrastructure, including long distance transmission systems, smart grids, storage, and demand response.
:(19) The [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]]states that since 2005 renewable energy has garnered more than $1.3 trillion worth of investment and the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]]estimates that global energy consumption will increase by 47 percent between 2010 and 2035, with clean energy providing more than half of that new capacity and attracting up to $5.9 trillion worth of investment, leading to new employment and investment opportunities.
