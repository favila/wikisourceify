{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to establish a Community Gardens Pilot Program, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Community Gardening and Nutrition Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) A community garden improves the quality of life, encourages self-reliance, produces highly nutritious food, reduces family food budgets, and creates opportunities for recreation, social interaction, exercise, education, and economic development for people participating in the garden.
:(2) The creation of community gardens has been an effective approach to cleaning up and maintaining abandoned vacant lots.
:(3) Many community gardens donate fresh fruits and vegetables to local food pantries, cooperatives, and homeless members of the community, and provide for a source of fresh fruits and vegetables for participants of the gardens.
:(4) An August 2013 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists entitled“The $11 Trillion Reward”concluded that if Americans were to eat 2.5 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of fruit daily, as recommended by Federal dietary guidelines, nearly 130,000 deaths could be prevented and $17 billion could be saved in medical costs.
:(5) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] recommends eating more dark green vegetables, legumes, and fruits; and eating fewer refined grains, less fat, and fewer calories.
:(6) A 2010 review of the Nutritional Implications of Farmers’ Markets and Community Gardens published by the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that community gardens promote healthy behaviors.
:(7) A 2011 pilot study entitled“LA Sprouts”published by the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that teaching gardening and nutrition improved the dietary intakes of children and reduced childhood obesity.
