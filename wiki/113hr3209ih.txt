==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Congregation and People of Tradition for Proselytism and Jihad, or more popularly known under its Hausa name Boko Haram ( Western education is sinful. ), is a Nigerian jihadist organization based in the northeastern part of that country.
:(2) Since its founding in 2001, Boko Haram reportedly has been responsible for the deaths of more than 10,000 persons, mostly Nigerians. This group has been officially designated by the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a terrorist organization, along with another group—Jama’atu Ansarul Muslimina Fi Biladis Sudan—under section 2 of Nigeria’s Terrorism Prevention Act of 2011 (as amended).
:(3) Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the August 26, 2011, bombing of the United Nations Building in Abuja in which 21 persons were killed and another 60 were injured.
:(4) In testimony before the [[w:United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] on January 31, 2012, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Boko Haram“ is interested in hitting targets, such as the U.S. Embassy and hotels frequented by Westerners. ” 
:(5) On February 23, 2012, United States Ambassador to Nigeria Terrance P. McCulley said that Boko Haram’s danger was expanding and that at least part of the group“ has decided it’s in their interest to attack the international community. ”.

==(b) Criteria– ==

   Section 219(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1189 8 U.S.C. 1189(a)(1)] )provides the 3 criteria for the designation of an organization as a Foreign Terrorist Organization:

:(3) The organization’s terrorist activity or terrorism must threaten the security of United States nationals or the national security (national defense, foreign relations, or the economic interests) of the United States.
