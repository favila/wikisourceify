{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day.    Whereas the primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well-being and help meet the basic needs of all people, especially the most vulnerable in society;   Whereas social work pioneers helped lead the Nation’s struggle for social justice;   Whereas social workers know that poverty and trauma can create lifelong social and economic disadvantages;   Whereas social workers know that discrimination of any kind limits human potential and must be eliminated;   Whereas social workers stand up for individuals and support diverse families in every community;   Whereas social workers help people in every stage of life function better in their environments, improve their relationships with others, and solve personal and family problems;   Whereas all children have the right to safe environments and quality education;   Whereas dignity and care giving for older adults help define a Nation’s character;   Whereas veterans and their families need community support to ensure successful transitions after service;   Whereas access to mental health treatment and health care services saves millions of lives;   Whereas social workers are change agents who put the ideals of citizenship into action every day;   Whereas social workers believe in shared prosperity and opportunity for everyone;   Whereas social work research and advocacy turn community needs into national priorities;   Whereas social workers celebrate the courage, hope, and strength of the human spirit throughout their careers; and   Whereas March is recognized as Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day is recognized on March 18, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
