{{Center|A BILL}}

To repeal title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for cooperative governing of individual health insurance coverage offered in interstate commerce.

={{anchor|H74F13487AB2A4AF2A97A9F53AD5717CA}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as “Health Care Choice Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|HAB3EE6FC8D6F4B0D87B6BF5D56E2C4DE}}Sec. 2. Specification of constitutional authority for enactment of law=

This Act is enacted pursuant to the power granted [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] under article I, section 8, clause 3, of the United States Constitution.

={{anchor|HC1BB26D179AE4A2B9BF82B4B75B0C40F}}Sec. 3. Findings=

[[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The application of numerous and significant variations in State law and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act impacts the ability of insurers to offer, and individuals to obtain, affordable individual health insurance coverage, thereby impeding commerce in individual health insurance coverage.
:(2) Mandates for health care coverage established by title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will significantly elevate health insurance costs beyond State and Federal ability to pay.
:(3) Individual health insurance coverage is increasingly offered through the Internet, other electronic means, and by mail, all of which are inherently part of interstate commerce.
:(4) In response to these issues, it is appropriate to encourage increased efficiency in the offering of individual health insurance coverage through a collaborative approach by the States in regulating this coverage.
:(5) The establishment of risk-retention groups has provided a successful model for the sale of insurance across State lines, as the acts establishing those groups allow insurance to be sold in multiple States but regulated by a single State.

={{anchor|HFA395A2E8CBA4E5595F4586AACEACA8C}}Sec. 4. Repeal of title I of PPACA=

Effective as of the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ([[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]]), title I of such Act is repealed (and any amendments to such title, or to amendments made by such title, made by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ([[Public Law 111-152|Public Law 111–152]]) are repealed), and the provisions of law amended or repealed by such title (or amendments) are restored or revived as if such title (and amendments) had not been enacted.
