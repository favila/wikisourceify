Each department and agency of the Federal Government.

A contractor that—: has entered into a contract with the Federal Government to which section 2(b)(1) of the Service Contract Act of 1965 ( 41 U.S.C. 351(b)(1) ) applies, and any subcontractor under such contract; or: has entered into a contract exempted from the application of such Act by section 6 of such Act ( 41 U.S.C. 356 ) , and any subcontractor under such contract.

====(3) Phasing-in for other employers====


=====(A) Two years for employers of 100 or more=====

Entities that employ 100 or more individuals in the United States must satisfy the requirement in paragraph (1) by not later than two years after the date of the enactment of this Act.
=====(B) Three years for employers with 30 or more employees=====

All entities that employ 30 or more individuals in the United States must satisfy the requirement in paragraph (1) by not later than three years after the date of the enactment of this Act.

=====(A) Findings=====

The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds as follows:: A majority of the 0.4 percent of tentative non-confirmations that are issued within E-Verify to work authorized individuals occur due to incorrect or outdated information in the databases utilized by the system. For instance, an individual may have changed his or her name legally but has not updated their Social Security information to account for this change. This person would likely receive a tentative non-confirmation if their work eligibility were checked using E-Verify.: E-Verify already provides employers and employees with simple and clear instructions on how inconsistencies in data can be corrected in order to verify the work eligibility of an employee. However, giving an individual the ability to verify his or her own employment eligibility in advance of an official E-Verify query by an employer would allow that individual to correct data errors at his or her convenience. This may also serve to lessen peak demand on Social Security Administration field offices.
=====(B) Study=====

The [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office ]]shall conduct a study to examine the potential of a secure method of allowing individuals to check their own work eligibility, so that they can address inconsistencies in their personal data that might otherwise cause them to be issued a tentative non-confirmation by E-Verify.

====(10) Document fraud study====
