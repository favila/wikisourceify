The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(i) A majority of the 0.4 percent of tentative non-confirmations that are issued within E-Verify to work authorized individuals occur due to incorrect or outdated information in the databases utilized by the system.

This person would likely receive a tentative non-confirmation if their work eligibility were checked using E-Verify.
:(ii) E-Verify already provides employers and employees with simple and clear instructions on how inconsistencies in data can be corrected in order to verify the work eligibility of an employee. However, giving an individual the ability to verify his or her own employment eligibility in advance of an official E-Verify query by an employer would allow that individual to correct data errors at his or her convenience. This may also serve to lessen peak demand on Social Security Administration field offices.
