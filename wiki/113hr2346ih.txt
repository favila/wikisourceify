{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the National Labor Relations Act to ensure the right of employees to a secret ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Secret Ballot Protection Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) the importance of a secret ballot election has been recognized by the United States for over 100 years;
:(2) the fundamental democratic right to choose by secret ballot is the only method that ensures a choice free of coercion, intimidation, irregularity, or illegality;
:(3) the recognition of a labor organization by way of a private agreement, rather than a secret ballot election supervised by a neutral third party, threatens an employee’s right, codified in the National Labor Relations Act , to choose whether or not to be represented by a labor organization; and
:(4) preserving workers’ right to choose whether or not to be represented by a labor organization through a secret ballot election is important to the strength of the national economy.
