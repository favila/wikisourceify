{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating September 23, 2014, as ‘‘National Falls Prevention Awareness Day’’ to raise awareness and encourage the prevention of falls among older adults.    Whereas adults who are age 65 or older (referred to in this preamble as“older adults”) are the fastest-growing population in the United States;   Whereas the number of older adults in the United States is expected to increase from 35,000,000 older adults in 2000 to 79,700,000 older adults in 2040;   Whereas each year, 1 out of every 3 older adults in the United States falls;   Whereas falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults;   Whereas in 2012, more than 2,400,000 older adults were treated in hospital emergency departments for fall-related injuries, and more than 722,000 older adults were subsequently hospitalized from such injuries;   Whereas in 2011, more than 22,900 older adults in the United States died from injuries related to unintentional falls;   Whereas in 2010, the total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults, adjusted for inflation, was $30,000,000,000;   Whereas between 2004 and 2014, the rate of death from falls of older adults in the United States has risen sharply;   Whereas the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]estimate that if the rate of falls does not decrease, the annual cost of injuries from falls will reach an estimated $67,700,000,000 by 2020; and   Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing falls by utilizing cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs to improve balance and strength, medication management, vision improvement, comprehensive clinical assessments, and reduction of home hazards: Now, therefore, be it
