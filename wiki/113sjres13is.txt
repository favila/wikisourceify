{{Center|JOINT RESOLUTION}}

 Amending title 36, United States Code, to designate July 26 as United States Intelligence Professionals Day.    Whereas on July 26, 1908, Attorney General Charles Bonaparte ordered newly hired Federal investigators to report to the Office of the Chief Examiner of the Department of Justice, which subsequently was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation;   Whereas on July 26, 1947, President Truman signed the  National Security Act of 1947 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/401 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] ), creating the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[w:United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], the [[w:Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency]], and the [[w:Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Joint Chiefs of Staff]], thereby laying the foundation for today’s intelligence community;   Whereas the National Security Act of 1947 , which appears in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/ title 50 of the United States Code], governs the definition, composition, responsibilities, authorities, and oversight of the intelligence community of the United States;   Whereas the intelligence community is defined by  section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/401a 50 U.S.C. 401a(4)] )to include the [[w:|Office of the Director of National Intelligence]], the [[w:Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[w:National Security Agency/Central Security Service|National Security Agency]], the [[w:Defense Intelligence Agency|Defense Intelligence Agency]], the [[w:National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], the [[w:|National Reconnaissance Office]], other offices within the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]for the collection of specialized national intelligence through reconnaissance programs, the intelligence elements of the [[w:U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command|Army]], the [[w:Naval Intelligence Command|Navy]], the [[w:Air Force Intelligence Service|Air Force]], the [[w:United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], the [[w:United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[w:Drug Enforcement Administration|Drug Enforcement Administration]], and the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], the [[w:Bureau of Intelligence and Research|Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the Department of State]], the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of the Treasury]], the elements of the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]concerned with the analysis of intelligence information, and other elements as may be designated;   Whereas July 26, 2012, was the 65th anniversary of the signing of the  National Security Act of 1947 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/401 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] );   Whereas the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ([[Public Law -|Public Law 108–458]];118 Stat. 3638)created the position of the [[w:|Director of National Intelligence]]to serve as the head of the intelligence community and to ensure that national intelligence be timely, objective, independent of political considerations, and based upon all sources available;   Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has previously passed joint resolutions, signed by the [[w:President of the United States|President]], to designate Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, Patriot Day on September 11, and other commemorative occasions, to honor the sacrifices of law enforcement officers and of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001;   Whereas the United States has increasingly relied upon the men and women of the intelligence community to protect and defend the security of the United States in the decade since the attacks of September 11, 2001;   Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community, both civilian and military, have been increasingly called upon to deploy to theaters of war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere since September 11, 2001;   Whereas numerous intelligence officers of the elements of the intelligence community have been injured or killed in the line of duty;   Whereas intelligence officers of the United States are routinely called upon to accept personal hardship and sacrifice in the furtherance of their mission to protect the United States, to undertake dangerous assignments in the defense of the interests of the United States, to collect reliable information within prescribed legal authorities upon which the leaders of the United States rely in life-and-death situations, and to“speak truth to power,”by providing their best assessments to decisionmakers, regardless of political and policy considerations;   Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community have on numerous occasions succeeded in preventing attacks upon the United States and allies of the United States, saving numerous innocent lives; and   Whereas intelligence officers of the United States must of necessity often remain unknown and unrecognized for their substantial achievements and successes: Now, therefore, be it
