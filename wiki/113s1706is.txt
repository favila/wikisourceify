 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit the Secretary of the Treasury to issue prospective guidance clarifying the employment status of individuals for purposes of employment taxes and to prevent retroactive assessments with respect to such clarifications.   

=Section 1. Short title; findings; purposes=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“ Fair Playing Field Act of 2013 ”.

==(b) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) In 1978, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] was concerned that lack of clarity as to the proper classification of some workers, increased [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] enforcement activity, and retroactive application by [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] of interpretations that were arguably new had caused hardships for some small businesses and other taxpayers and confusion as to the applicable rules.
:(2) To allow time to develop a comprehensive approach to the problem, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] enacted section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 as an interim measure protecting taxpayers from liability for mis­clas­si­fi­ca­tion if the taxpayer has a reasonable basis for classifying a worker as an independent contractor and meets certain other conditions. In addition, the Act prohibited the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] from publishing regulations or revenue rulings on workers’ employment tax status pending the expected near-term enactment of clarifying legislation.
:(3) During the ensuing 33 years, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] made section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 permanent; however, changes in working relationships and the continued prohibition on new guidance have increased the uncertainty as to the proper classification of workers.
:(4) Many workers are properly classified as independent contractors. In other instances, workers who are employees are being treated as independent contractors. Such misclassification for tax purposes contributes to inequities in the competitive positions of businesses and to the Federal and State tax gap, and may also result in misclassification for other purposes, such as denial of unemployment benefits, workplace health and safety protections, and retirement or other benefits or protections available to employees.
:(5) Workers, businesses, and other taxpayers will benefit from clear guidance regarding employment tax status. In the interest of fairness and in view of many service recipients’ reliance on current section 530 , such guidance should apply only prospectively.

==(c) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are to permit the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to provide guidance allowing workers and businesses to clearly understand the proper Federal tax classification of workers and to provide relief allowing an orderly transition to new rules designed to increase certainty and uniformity of treatment. 

=Sec. 2. Authority to issue guidance clarifying employment status for purposes of employment taxes=



==(a) In general– ==

  Chapter 25 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

===(a) In general– ===

===(b) Prohibition on retroactive assessments– ===



====(1) In general– ====

If—

====(2) Statutory standards providing one method of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (1)– ====

:(A) Judicial precedent, published rulings, technical advice with respect to the taxpayer, or a letter ruling to the taxpayer.
:(B) A past [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] audit of the taxpayer in which there was no assessment attributable to the treatment (for purposes of any tax imposed by this subtitle) of the individuals holding positions substantially similar to the position held by such individual.
:(C) Long-standing recognized practice of a significant segment of the industry in which such individual was engaged.

====(3) Consistency required in the case of prior tax treatment– ====

  Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the treatment of any individual (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the reclassified individual) for purposes of any tax imposed by this subtitle for any period ending after December 31, 1978, if the taxpayer (or a predecessor) has treated any individual holding a substantially similar position as an employee for purposes of any tax imposed by this subtitle for any period beginning after December 31, 1977, and ending before the reclassification date with respect to such reclassified individual.
