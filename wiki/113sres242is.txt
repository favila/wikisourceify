{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of“Growth Awareness Week”.    Whereas, according to the Pictures of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed Malformations database (commonly known as the“POSSUM”database), more than 600 serious diseases and health conditions cause growth failure;   Whereas health conditions that cause growth failure may affect the overall health of a child;   Whereas short stature may be a symptom of a serious underlying health condition;   Whereas growth failure in children is often undiagnosed;   Whereas, according to the MAGIC Foundation for Children’s Growth, 48 percent of children in the United States who were evaluated for the 2 most common causes of growth failure were undiagnosed with growth failure;   Whereas the longer a child with growth failure goes undiagnosed, the greater the potential for damage and higher costs of care;   Whereas early detection and a diagnosis of growth failure are crucial to ensure a healthy future for a child with growth failure;   Whereas raising public awareness of, and educating the public about, growth failure is a vital public service;   Whereas providing resources for identification of growth failure will allow for early detection; and   Whereas the MAGIC Foundation for Children's Growth has designated the third week of September as“Growth Awareness Week”: Now, therefore, be it
