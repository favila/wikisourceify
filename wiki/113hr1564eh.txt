:(3) what affect the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002has had on registered public accounting firms’ independence and whether additional independence reforms are needed.

==(b) Report Required– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:|Comptroller General]] shall submit a report to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate]] and the [[w:United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives]] on the results of the study and review required by this section.
