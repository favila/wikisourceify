{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide protection for company-provided retiree health benefits.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Earned Retiree Healthcare Benefits Protection Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Retired participants of group health plans regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA) have been severely harmed by the virtually unchecked practices of sponsors of such plans involving the post-retirement cancellation or reduction of earned health benefits contrary to assurances retirees received prior to retirement that such benefits would be with them for life.
:(2) Such widespread post-retirement reductions in retiree health benefits has led to a crisis in retiree health care in which retirees—
::(A) have been unable to substitute individual coverage for the group coverage they lost, or, in order to obtain individual coverage, have jeopardized their economic security in retirement;
::(B) because of preexisting medical conditions cannot obtain substitute coverage that they can afford without depleting their life savings or have been unable to obtain adequate medical care or medical care they had relied on to deal with serious illness;
::(C) have sustained catastrophic illnesses or injuries or otherwise experienced a marked deterioration in their medical conditions or health as a result of post-retirement changes to their medical benefits;
::(D) have been transferred indiscriminately into improperly or inadequately managed health maintenance organizations or other managed care entities, resulting in the worsening rather than improvement of prior medical conditions; and
::(E) in many instances, have failed to obtain adequate relief in the courts due to highly restrictive judicial interpretations which are inconsistent with ERISA’sunderlying protective purposes.
:(3) The crisis in retiree healthcare generated by the plan sponsor practice of post-retirement cancellations or reductions of previously promised earned retiree health benefits has led to a widespread loss of confidence in the integrity of ERISA-regulated group health plans and the ability of ERISAitself to adequately protect retiree health benefits.
:(4) A strong and dependable private sector retiree health system is a necessary component to the essential health of our Nation’s senior citizens.

==(b) Purposes– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The purposes of this Act are to ensure that the reasonable health benefit expectations of retirees from ERISA-regulated group health plans are fulfilled, to minimize the incidence of prolonged legal disputes arising out of the post-retirement cancellation or reduction of earned retiree health benefits from such plans, and to prevent further adverse effects on retiree health arising from such post-retirement changes.

===(2) Future safeguards and enforceable obligations– ===

To carry out the purposes described in paragraph (1):
:(A) The provisions of this Act safeguard retired participants of group health plans subject to ERISAfrom loss or reduction of their health benefits from such plans by barring plan sponsors from canceling or reducing such benefits after the dates such participants retire and when they no longer are able to absorb such losses or reductions without experiencing adverse effects on their health or finances.
:(B) The provisions of this Act also establish an enforceable obligation on the part of sponsors of such group health plans to restore health benefits previously taken away from retired participants of such plans to the extent such benefits were cancelled or altered after the dates such participants retired. The obligation is limited to restoring healthcare benefits only back to specified levels, and the obligation does not apply if the plan sponsor would sustain substantial business hardship by restoring such benefits.

=Sec. 3. Retiree health benefit protections in group health plans=



==(a) In general– ==

 Subtitle B of title I of theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974is amended by adding at the end the following new part:

<blockquote>

===8 Emergency retiree health benefit protections– ===



===Sec. 801. Prohibition against post-retirement reductions of retiree health benefits by group health plans===



====(a) In general– ====

Notwithstanding that a group health plan described in subsection (b)may contain a provision reserving the general power to amend or terminate the plan or a provision specifically authorizing the plan to make post-retirement reductions in retiree health benefits, the benefits provided to a retired participant or his or her beneficiary under the terms of the plan may not be reduced, whether through amendment or otherwise, if such reduction of benefits occurs after the date the participant has retired for purposes of the plan and reduces benefits that were provided to the participant, or his or her beneficiary, as of the date the participant retired. Any group health plan provision which is purported to authorize the reduction of benefits in a manner inconsistent with the preceding sentence shall be void as against public policy.

====(b) Group health plan– ====

For purposes of this part, the term group health plan has the same meaning as in section 607(1).

====(c) Prohibited reduction of benefits– ====

For purposes of this part, any reference to a reduction of benefits shall be construed to be a reference to any amendment to a group health plan, or to any other action, which has the effect of—
:(1) canceling, decreasing, or limiting the amount, type, or form of any benefit or option provided prior to the amendment or action;
:(2) imposing or increasing out-of-pocket costs that a retired participant, or his or her beneficiary, must pay in order for benefits that were provided under the plan to the participant or beneficiary prior to the amendment or action to be provided to the participant or beneficiary after the amendment or action; or
:(3) modifying the manner by which medical services are delivered under the plan so that after the amendment or action a retired participant, or his or her beneficiary, has less ready access to the delivery of any such medical services than the participant or beneficiary had prior to the amendment or action.

====(d) Treatment of plan termination– ====



=====(1) In general– =====

Subject to paragraph (2), a termination of a group health plan shall be treated as a reduction in benefits prohibited under subsection (a)if, after the termination, the plan sponsor of the terminated plan fails to continue to provide to the participants who retired prior to the termination and to their beneficiaries the same retiree health benefits that were provided prior to the termination.

=====(2) Waiver– =====

 Paragraph (1)shall not apply in the case of the termination of a group health plan if the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] issues a waiver under this paragraph in connection with such termination. The [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] shall issue such a waiver if and only if the plan sponsor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] , in accordance with regulations prescribed by the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] , that such plan sponsor will be unable to continue in business unless such a waiver is issued.

===Sec. 802. Adoption by group health plans of provision barring post-retirement reductions in retiree health benefits===

Each group health plan which provides, as of the date of a participant’s retirement under the plan, benefits after such date with respect to such participant or his or her beneficiaries shall contain a provision which expressly bars any reduction in such benefits after such date, either under the terms of the plan or by any fiduciary of the plan.

:(2) The participant retired under the plan before the date of the enactment of such Act, and a reduction in benefits, with respect to any benefit or option provided to the retired participant under the plan as of the date the participant retired, took effect after the participant’s date of retirement and before the date of the enactment of such Act.
:(3) The retired participant has elected to restore benefits under the plan within the restoration period prescribed pursuant to subsection (b)and in accordance with such procedures as may be established under the plan pursuant to regulations of the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] .

====(b) Restoration period– ====

For purposes of this section, the term restoration period means a period which shall be prescribed by the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] and which—
:(1) begins not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Earned Retiree Healthcare Benefits Protection Act of 2013;
:(2) ends before the end of the 2-year period beginning with such date, or such longer period as may result from a suspension of such 2-year period by the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] pursuant to section 804(g); and

:(B) any imposition or increase in out-of-pocket costs that the participant, or his or her beneficiary, must pay which resulted in the reduction in benefits is rescinded or lessened so as to result in the level of out-of-pocket costs in effect for the plan year beginning with or during 1991 (in the case of a participant described in paragraph (1)(A)) or as of immediately prior to the reduction (in the case of a participant described in paragraph (1)(B)); and
:(C) any modification in the manner by which medical services are delivered under the plan which resulted in the reduction in benefits is rescinded or amended so as to result in a manner by which medical services are delivered under the plan which is substantially equivalent to the manner by which medical services are delivered in effect for the plan year beginning with or during 1991 (in the case of a participant described in paragraph (1)(A)) or as of immediately prior to the reduction (in the case of a participant described in paragraph (1)(B)).
