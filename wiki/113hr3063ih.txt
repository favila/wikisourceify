:::(I) every 5 years; or
:::(II) within such other time period specified and justified by the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]] in the plan;

:(C) identify data and analysis, especially concerning recreational fishing, that, if available, would reduce uncertainty in and improve the accuracy of future stock assessments, including whether such data and analysis could be 10 provided by nongovernmental sources, including fishermen, fishing communities, universities, and research institutions.

====(3) Waiver of stock assessment requirement– ====

Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A)(ii)and (B)(ii), a stock assessment is not required for a stock of fish in the plan if the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]] determines that such a stock assessment is not necessary and justifies such determination in the Federal Register notice required by this subsection..
