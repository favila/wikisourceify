==Title I— Rulemakings==



==Sec. 101. Rulemaking and findings with regard to rulemaking==



===(a) Rulemaking– ===

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General,]] the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] , and the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] shall make rules to implement this Act and the amendments carried out by this Act. To the extent necessary to ensure that such rules are made in a timely manner, the rules shall take effect on an interim basis, at the same time that notice and opportunity for public comment are offered. Access to the relief provided by this Act and previous Acts listed in subsection (b)is in the public interest, as necessary to protect health and safety and promulgation of regulations that take effect on an interim basis falls within the good cause exception in the Administrative Procedure Act.

===(b) Findings– ===

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] , the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] , and the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] shall promulgate interim regulations to implement the provisions not amended or repealed from the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act of 2000([[Public Law 106-386|Public Law 106–386]] ), the Violence Against Women Act and Department Justice Reauthorization Act of 2006([[Public Law 109-162|Public Law 109–162]] )and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008([[Public Law 110-457|Public Law 110–457]] ). Insofar as required to carry out the previous sentence in a timely manner, such regulations shall be promulgated to take effect on an interim basis, at the same time that notice and opportunity for public comment are offered.

==Title II— Protections for victims==



==Sec. 201. Employment authorization for immigrant victims==



===(a) Findings– ===

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] created immigration protections for immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, human trafficking, and other crime victims for two important purposes—to facilitate prosecution of perpetrators and to enhance victim safety.
:(2) The safety of immigrant victims applying for protection under the Violence Against Women Act or the Trafficking Victims Protection Actis undermined when government agencies delay in providing legal work authorization. Immigrant victims’ ability to seek help and to cooperate in the detection, investigation or prosecution crimes committed against them is enhanced when victims can work lawfully and sever their economic dependence on the perpetrator.
:(3) When victims know that they will receive legal work authorization within 180 days of filing their for victim related immigration relief, victims and their advocates can develop safety plans that will focus on steps the victim can take to keep herself and her children safe during the work authorization waiting period. This can include stays in an emergency shelter and transitional housing, obtaining legal custody of her children and learning skills that will enhance her employability.
:(4) The economic stability that comes from the ability to work lawfully in the United States reduces victims’ vulnerability to abuse, exploitation and coercion from crime perpetrators.
:(5)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] in VAWA 2000 and VAWA 2005 took steps to encourage DHS to grant immigrant crime victims swift access to legal work authorization. However, as of 2011 73.9% of VAWA self-petitioners and 93.9% of U-visa applicants endure delays of longer than 6 months before receiving legal work authorization. Of these many wait well over a year after filing before receiving work authorization—36.7% of VAWA self-petitioners and 32% of U-visa applicants. These delays harm criminal prosecutions and endanger victims and their children.

===(b) Employment authorization for immigrant victims– ===
