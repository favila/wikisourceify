The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) The National Cancer Institute estimates that 1 in 8 women in the United States will develop a cancer of the breast in their lifetime.

:(3) Individuals receiving mammograms are not currently required to receive medical summaries or reports from their mammogram providers which address breast density or its correlation to masking the presence of breast cancer on mammograms, despite the fact that the radiologist interpreting the mammogram makes an assessment of the patient’s breast density.
