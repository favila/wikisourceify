::(i) Ease of access to relevant training for local emergency first responders, including an analysis of—
:::(I) the number of individuals being trained;
:::(II) the number of individuals who are applying;
:::(III) whether current demand is being met;
:::(IV) current challenges; and
:::(V) projected needs.
::(ii) Modernization of course content related to rail hazardous materials incidents, with a particular focus on response to the exponential rise in oil shipments by rail.
::(iii) Training content across agencies and the private sector to provide complementary opportunities for rail hazardous materials incidents courses and materials to avoid overlap, including the following:
:::(I) Overlap of course content among agencies.
:::(II) Integrated course content through public-private partnerships.
:::(III) Regular and ongoing evaluation of course opportunities, adaptation to emerging trends, agency and private sector outreach, effectiveness and ease of access for local emergency responders.
