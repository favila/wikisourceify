{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for the network of experienced and accredited wildlife rehabilitation centers across the United States and honoring their important work in protecting native wildlife.    Whereas across the United States, wildlife rehabilitators take in hundreds of thousands of wild animals every year that have been orphaned, injured, or become sick;   Whereas the purpose of wildlife rehabilitators is to restore health and subsequently to release wild animals indigenous to the United States;   Whereas many of the wild animals cared for by rehabilitators are protected by Federal and State laws;   Whereas rehabilitators are often volunteers and are not directly funded by Federal or State natural resources or wildlife agencies;   Whereas most wildlife rehabilitators instead incur significant costs to fund their activities, paying for everything from incubators to expensive specialty food;   Whereas in addition to significant financial expenditures, wildlife rehabilitators also spend substantial time and energy caring for and bringing native wildlife back to health;   Whereas members of the general public cannot meet the specialized needs of wild animals, and the United States needs a professional network of trained individuals to provide this care; and   Whereas most wild animals are orphaned or injured and rehabilitators give them a second chance: Now, therefore, be it

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]recognizes the importance of experienced and accredited wildlife rehabilitation centers and their numerous contributions to the humane treatment of animals throughout the United States.
