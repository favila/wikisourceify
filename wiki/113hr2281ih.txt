=={{anchor|H5B67CF80FD7B4AC5993AADDF24D3BAB0}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The United States faces persistent cyber espionage of intellectual property from foreign governments that threatens United States economic and national security interests, results in an unfair competitive advantage for foreign companies, and is a major contributor to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States.
:(2) Cyber espionage of intellectual property by foreign actors is one of the most pressing issues facing innovators and entrepreneurs in the United States today.
:(3) The National Counterintelligence Executive stated in its October 2011 biennial economic espionage report that“Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage”and that“United States private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.
:(4) The National Counterintelligence Executive also stated that“Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from U.S. targets”.
:(5) The People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and other countries threaten the privacy of United States citizens by accessing and exploiting personally identifiable information through cyber economic espionage.
:(6) The People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and other countries responsible for such cyber economic espionage are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and have agreed to comply with the global system of rules and obligations governing the international commerce and trade among member states.
:(7) The United States has recognized the membership of the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and other countries into the WTO by granting them Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status under United States law.
:(8) Cyber economic espionage undermines the cooperative relationships between the United States and countries tolerating or encouraging such activities.

=={{anchor|H61AC497851DD4033B7BDB96F887ADFBF}}(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) cyber economic espionage should be a priority issue in all economic and diplomatic discussions with the People’s Republic of China, including during all meetings of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and with the Russian Federation and other countries determined to encourage, tolerate, or conduct such cyber economic espionage at appropriate bilateral meetings;
:(2) the United States should intensify diplomatic efforts in appropriate international fora such as the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] , the [[w:|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), and summits such as the G–8 and G–20 summits, to address the harm to the international economic order by cyber economic espionage; and
:(3) the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] should increase its efforts to bring economic espionage criminal cases against offending foreign actors, with penalties to include both fines and imprisonment, as well as encourage further cooperation among countries to address cyber economic espionage through criminal prosecutions.
