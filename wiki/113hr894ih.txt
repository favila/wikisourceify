====(b) Court– ====

Whenever it appears that any fiduciary, in the opinion of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] , is not properly executing or has not properly executed the duties of the trust of such fiduciary or has collected or paid, or is attempting to collect or pay, fees, commissions, or allowances that are inequitable or in excess of those allowed by law for the duties performed or expenses incurred, or has failed to make such payments as may be necessary for the benefit of the ward or the dependents of the ward, then the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] may appear, by the Secretary's authorized attorney, in the court which has appointed such fiduciary, or in any court having original, concurrent, or appellate jurisdiction over said cause, and make proper presentation of such matters. The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] , in the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary's]] discretion, may suspend payments to any such fiduciary who shall neglect or refuse, after reasonable notice, to render an account to the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] from time to time showing the application of such payments for the benefit of such incompetent or minor beneficiary, or who shall neglect or refuse to administer the estate according to law.

All or any part of any benefits the payment of which is suspended or withheld under this section may, in the discretion of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] , be paid temporarily to the person having custody and control of the incompetent or minor beneficiary, to be used solely for the benefit of such beneficiary, or, in the case of an incompetent veteran, may be apportioned to the dependent or dependents, if any, of such veteran. Any part not so paid and any funds of a mentally incompetent or insane veteran not paid to the chief officer of the institution in which such veteran is a patient nor apportioned to the veteran's dependent or dependents may be ordered held in the Treasury to the credit of such beneficiary. All funds so held shall be disbursed under the order and in the discretion of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] for the benefit of such beneficiary or the beneficiary's dependents.

If any balance remains, such balance shall be deposited to the credit of the applicable current appropriation; except that there may be paid only so much of such balance as may be necessary to reimburse a person (other than a political subdivision of the United States) who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial of the veteran for such expenses. No payment shall be made under the two preceding sentences of this subsection unless claim therefor is filed with the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] within five years after the death of the veteran, except that, if any person so entitled under said two sentences is under legal disability at the time of death of the veteran, such five-year period of limitation shall run from the termination or removal of the legal disability.

====(e) Escheatment– ====

Any funds in the hands of a fiduciary appointed by a State court or the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] derived from benefits payable under laws administered by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] , which under the law of the State wherein the beneficiary had last legal residence would escheat to the State, shall escheat to the United States and shall be returned by such fiduciary, or by the personal representative of the deceased beneficiary, less legal expenses of any administration necessary to determine that an escheat is in order, to the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] , and shall be deposited to the credit of the applicable revolving fund, trust fund, or appropriation..
