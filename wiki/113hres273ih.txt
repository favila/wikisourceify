{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President should nominate a qualified and independent individual for the position of Inspector General of the Department of State and Broadcasting Board of Governors to be confirmed by the Senate without delay.    Whereas the Inspector General Act of 1978 mandates that Inspectors General are to conduct independent and objective audits, investigations, and inspections, prevent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse, promote economy, effectiveness, and efficiency, review pending legislation and regulations, and keep the agency heads and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] fully and currently informed;   Whereas the [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of State]] and [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG) detects, investigates, and prevents instances of fraud, waste, and mismanagement that may constitute either criminal wrongdoing or violation of [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] or [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]] regulations;   Whereas the [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|OIG]] inspects United States diplomatic and consular posts and international broadcasting installations throughout the world to determine whether policy goals are being achieved and whether the interests of the United States are being represented and advanced effectively;   Whereas the [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|OIG]] conducts specialized security inspections and audits in support of the Department of Stateâ€™s mission to provide effective protection to United States personnel, facilities, and sensitive information;   Whereas the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] employs a total of nearly 70,000 personnel, consisting of approximately 24,500 direct hire Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel, over 9,300 of whom are stationed overseas, and more than 45,000 locally employed staff, creating difficult accountability challenges;   Whereas a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed Inspector General provides the leadership and accountability within an [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|OIG]] necessary to oversee a cabinet-level agency and fulfill the duties described in this resolution, while instilling confidence in agency interlocutors and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] ;   Whereas the position of [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|Inspector General for the Department of State]] and [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]] has been vacant since January 16, 2008, a span of nearly 2,000 days, and is being filled by an interim appointment;   Whereas this vacancy is the longest of any [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|OIG]] across the Federal Government; and   Whereas filling this vacancy will help ensure that the [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|OIG]] provides the robust oversight necessary to keep [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] fully and currently informed, protect the United States taxpayer, and ensure good governance: Now, therefore, be it
