This Act may be cited as the“ Scleroderma Research and Awareness Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Scleroderma is a chronic, disabling and often fatal autoimmune disease in which the body’s soft tissues contract and harden due to an overproduction of collagen.
:(2) Scleroderma causes damage to one or more of the body’s organ systems, including the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and blood vessels.
:(3) It is estimated that 300,000 people in the United States suffer from scleroderma, 80 percent of whom are women often diagnosed during their child bearing years.
:(4) Choctaw Native Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics are disproportionately affected by scleroderma and tend to exhibit more rapidly progressing and severe cases of the disease.
:(5) The causes of scleroderma are unknown.
:(6) Scleroderma is associated with many other conditions including pulmonary hypertension, gastroparesis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, Sjögren’s Syndrome and lupus.
:(7) The estimated total annual economic impact of scleroderma in the United States is in excess of $1,500,000,000.
:(8) Annual Federal support for scleroderma research at the National Institutes of Health is currently estimated at $20,000,000.
