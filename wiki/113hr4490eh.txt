=Sec. 2. Findings and declarations=

Congress finds and declares the following:
:(1) United States international broadcasting exists to advance the United States interests and values by presenting accurate, objective, and comprehensive news and information, which is the foundation for democratic governance, to societies that lack a free media.
:(2) Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that“<nowiki>[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression</nowiki>”, and that“this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”.
:(3) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before the [[w:United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives]]on January 23, 2013, that the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors]]( [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]])“is practically a defunct agency in terms of its capacity to be able to tell a message around the world. So we’re abdicating the ideological arena and need to get back into it.”.
:(4) The [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]], which was created by Congress to oversee the United States international broadcasting in the wake of the Cold War, has, because of structural and managerial issues, had limited success to date in both coordinating the various components of the international broadcasting framework and managing the day-to-day operations of the Federal components of the international broadcasting framework.
:(5) The lack of regular attendance by board members and a periodic inability to form a quorum have plagued the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]and, as a result, it has been functionally incapable of running the agency.
:(6) The board of governors has only achieved the full slate of all nine governors for seven of its 17 years of existence, which highlights the difficulties of confirming and retaining governors under the current structure.
:(7) Both the [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|Department of State’s Office of Inspector General]]and the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]have issued reports which outline a severely dysfunctional organizational structure of the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors]].
:(8) The [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|Inspector General of the Department of State]]concluded in its January 2013 report that dysfunction of the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]stems from“a flawed legislative structure and acute internal dissension”.
:(9) The [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|Inspector General of the Department of State]]also found that the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]’s structure of nine part-time members“cannot effectively supervise all United States Government-supported, civilian international broadcasting”, and its involvement in day-to-day operations has impeded normal management functions.
:(10) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]report determined that there was significant overlap among the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]’s languages services, and that the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]did not systematically consider the financial cost of overlap.
:(11) According to the [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|Office of the Inspector General]], the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]’s Office of Contracts is not in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, lacks appropriate contract oversight, and violates the Anti-Deficiency Act . The [[w:Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|Office of the Inspector General]]also determined that the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors]]has not adequately performed full and open competitions or price determinations, has entered into hundreds of personal service contracts without statutory authority, and contractors regularly work without valid contracts in place.
:(12) The size and make-up of the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]workforce should be closely examined, given the agency’s broader broadcasting and technical mission, as well as changing media technologies.
:(13) The [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|BBG]]should be structured to ensure that more taxpayer dollars are dedicated to the substantive, broadcasting, and information-related elements of the agency’s mission.
:(14) The lack of a coherent and well defined mission of the Voice of America has led to programming that duplicates the efforts of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, RFE/RL, Incorporated, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Incorporated that results in inefficient use of tax-payer funding.
:(15) The annual survey conducted by the“Partnership for Public Service”consistently ranks the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors]]at or near the bottom of all Federal agencies in terms of“overall best places to work”and“the extent to which employees feel their skills and talents are used effectively”. The consistency of these low scores point to structural, cultural, and functional problems at the [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors]].
:(16) The Federal and non-Federal organizations that comprise the United States international broadcasting framework have different, yet complementary, missions that necessitate coordination at all levels of management.
:(17) The [[w:Broadcasting Board of Governors|Broadcasting Board of Governors]]has an overabundance of senior civil service positions, defined here as full-time employees encumbering GS–14 and GS–15 positions on the General Schedule pay scale.
:(18) United States international broadcasting should seek to leverage public-private partnerships, including the licensing of content and the use of technology owned or operated by non-governmental sources, where possible to expand outreach capacity.
:(19) Shortwave broadcasting has been an important method of communication that should be utilized in regions as a component of United States international broadcasting where a critical need for the platform exists.
:(20) Congressional action is necessary at this time to improve international broadcasting operations, strengthen the United States public diplomacy efforts, enhance the grantee surrogate broadcasting effort, restore focus to news, programming, and content, and maximize the value of Federal and non-Federal resources that are dedicated to public diplomacy and international broadcasting.

:(3) To coordinate the complementary efforts of the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]and United States international broadcasting.
:(4) To create a United States international broadcasting framework that more effectively leverages the broadcasting tools available and creates specialization of expertise in mission oriented programming, while minimizing waste and inefficiency.
