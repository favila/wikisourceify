{{Center|A BILL}}

 To preserve the access of victims of trafficking to information about their eligibility to receive SNAP benefits.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “   Securing the Assistance of Victims of Exploitation Act of 2014 ( SAVE Act ) ”.  

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Trafficking in humans, and especially domestic child trafficking, has no place in a civilized society. Those who engage in this illicit trade should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
:(2) State and local law enforcement agencies should have the tools, resources, and training necessary to identify, apprehend, and prosecute criminals who ruthlessly traffic in children and young persons.
:(3) One of the most effective resources in bringing criminals to justice is the cooperation and assistance of their victims. 

=Sec. 3. Continuation of SNAP information assistance=

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds made available to carry out the  Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/2011 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.] )may be used in contravention of  section 107(b) of Division A of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (114 Stat. 1482;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/7105 22 U.S.C. 7105(b)]).
