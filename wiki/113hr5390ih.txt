{{Center|A BILL}}

 To impose sanctions against persons who knowingly provide material support or resources to the Donbass People’s Militia or its affiliates, associated groups, or agents, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Donbass People’s Militia Terrorist Designation Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Sense of Congress on designation of the Donbass People’s Militia as a foreign terrorist organization=



==(a) Findings– ==

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The Donbass People’s Militia (DPM) is an armed militia with allegiance to the Donestsk People’s Republic, a self-proclaimed State in Eastern Europe.
:(2) The organization consists of pro-Russian separatists that have taken up arms against the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Government of Ukraine.
:(3) The Government of Ukraine has concluded that the DPM is responsible for shooting down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014.
:(4) The actions of the DPM resulted in the deaths of 283 passengers, 80 of them children, and 15 crew members.
:(5) A [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]report released May 15, 2014, concluded that“in eastern Ukraine, freedom of expression is under particular attack through the harassment of, and threats to, journalists and media outlets and the increasing prevalence of hate speech is further fuelling tensions (Section I, Article 5, Section vi).”.
:(6) According to the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]report,“Armed groups continue to illegally seize and occupy public and administrative buildings in cities and towns of the eastern regions and proclaim“self-declared regions” ”.
:(7) Leaders and members of these armed groups commit an increasing number of human rights abuses, such as abductions, harassment, unlawful detentions, in particularly of journalists. This is leading to a breakdown in law and order and a climate of intimidation and harassment (Section I, Article 5, Section ii).
:(8) A report by the highly respected human rights advocacy organization, Human Rights Watch, found that“Anti-Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine are abducting, attacking, and harassing people they suspect of supporting the Ukrainian government or consider undesirable.”.
:(9) Militants in the self-proclaimed Donestsk People’s Republic have taken hostages and have yet to release them.
:(10) According to a report by the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]High Commissioner for Refugees, the actions of DPM and other militant groups have caused over 100,000 Ukrainians to flee their country as refugees and have also displaced approximately 54,000 citizens internally.

==(b) Criteria– ==

   Section 219(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1189 8 U.S.C. 1189(a)(1)] )provides the 3 criteria for the designation of an organization as a foreign terrorist organization:
:(1) The organization must be a foreign organization.
:(2) The organization must engage in terrorist activity, as defined in  section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)] ), or terrorism, as defined in  section 140(d)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f 22 U.S.C. 2656f(d)(2)] ), or retain the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism.
:(3) The organization’s terrorist activity or terrorism must threaten the security of United States nationals or the national security (national defense, foreign relations, or the economic interests) of the United States.

==(d) Report– ==

If the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]]does not designate the Donbass People’s Militia as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act within 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]]shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]a report that contains the reasons therefor.
