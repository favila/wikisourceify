{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for the establishment of a border protection strategy for the international land borders of the United States, to address the ecological and environmental impacts of border security infrastructure, measures, and activities along the international land borders of the United States, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Border Security and Responsibility Act of 2013”.

2. Purpose


The purposes of this Act are to provide a means whereby Federal lands and resources along the United States-Mexico border are provided the highest protection possible from the effects of unauthorized immigration, human and drug smuggling, and border enforcement activities, while ensuring that all operations necessary to achieve border security are undertaken.

3. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:
: Federal lands managed by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior ]]and the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture ]]encompass over 40 percent of the 1,900 miles of southwestern border in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas.: Over the last five years, the Border Patrol has nearly doubled the number of its agents on patrol, constructed hundreds of miles of border fence and vehicle barriers, and installed surveillance equipment on and near lands managed by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior ]]and the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture ]]along the southwestern border.: When operating on Federal lands, the Border Patrol has responsibilities under several Federal land management laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 , the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 , the Wilderness Act of 1964 , and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 .: In March 2006, the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior ]], the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security ]], and the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture ]]entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) entitled the “Cooperative National Security and Counterterrorism Efforts on Federal Lands along the United States’ Borders ”. This MOU contains provisions related to the development of an efficient means of communication, cooperative identification of patrol routes and operations, conduct of joint enforcement operations, cooperation in the development of environmental and cultural resources awareness training, access by [[Wikipedia:U.S. Customs and Border Protection|United States Customs and Border Protection ]](CBP) agents to Federal lands along the border, and guidance on construction and maintenance of tactical infrastructure.: Since entering into the 2006 MOU, the three departments have continually and successfully worked together to carry out the tenets outlined in the MOU at both the departmental and field levels, and have worked to address concerns regarding coordination to continually improve efforts to secure the borders while conserving the environment.: A 2008 MOU between the three departments bridges communication gaps and provides radio interoperability between Border Patrol agents and their law enforcement partners in the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior ]]and the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture ]].: Since fiscal year 2006, apprehensions of undocumented immigrants along the southwestern border have declined, reaching a low of 327,577 in fiscal year 2011. This decrease has occurred along the entire border, with every sector reporting fewer apprehensions in fiscal year 2011 than in fiscal year 2006.: CBP partners with Federal, tribal, State, and local entities to benefit border security and protection of the environment and cultural resources on Federal lands. The mission of the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security ]], the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior ]], and the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture ]]along the border are inextricably linked in protecting and strengthening United States communities.: A report by the [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office ]]found that Border Patrol agents in charge of Border Patrol stations reported that the overall security status of their jurisdictions is not affected by land management laws. Instead, factors other than access delays or restrictions, such as the remoteness and ruggedness of the terrain or dense vegetation, have had the greatest effect.
