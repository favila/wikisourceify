: those Creek persons settled in the north Florida panhandle in autonomous communities (referred to in the constitution of the Muscogee Nation as “Townships ”), continuing the lifestyle and traditions practiced by the historic Creek Nation of Alabama and Georgia;

: :: on dissolution of the Creek Confederacy, the ancestors of current members of the Muscogee Nation of Florida relocated and reestablished home sites, traditions, ceremonial centers, tribal government (including through the traditional appointment of tribal leaders), and tribal economy in rural areas of the State of Florida;
:: the relocation described in subparagraph (A) did not prevent the Nation from—

: :: in 1974, the State of Florida established the Northwest Florida Creek Indian Council to manage issues relating to Creek Indians in northwest Florida; and
:: in 1978, the Council held an election for representatives to the tribal government known as the “Florida Tribe of Eastern Creek Indians ”, which is now the Muscogee Nation of Florida;


: the community of Bruce in Walton County, Florida, has been a governing center for the Nation for more than 150 years;

:: beginning in the early 1860s, used and maintained the Antioch Cemetery, which remains in use by members of the Nation as of the date of enactment of this Act;

:: between 1895 and 1947, maintained a school that was attended by members of the Nation;

:: in 1912, established a church that is recognized by the Methodist Conference as a Native American church; and

:: maintained a ceremonial area on Bruce Creek that was attended until the late 1920s;


: the ceremonial area of the Nation, as in existence on the date of enactment of this Act—
:: is located in the community of Blountstown, Florida, one of the reservations referred to in the Apalachicola Treaty of October 11, 1832; and

:: is the site of continuing ceremonies, such as Green Corn, and traditional events;
