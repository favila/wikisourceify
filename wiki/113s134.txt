Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] , the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] , and the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] , jointly, shall undertake to enter into appropriate arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study and investigation of—
:(1) whether there is a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children; and
:(2) whether there is a connection between exposure to violent video programming and harmful effects on children.

=={{anchor|idF987D2FE7ABC4913AC3590B6FB1D954A}}(b) Contents of study and investigation– ==



==={{anchor|idF98B0A33300A47248FD6C25C7020013F}}(1) Violent video games– ===

The study and investigation under subsection (a)shall include—
:(A) whether the exposure listed under subsection (a)(1)—
::(i) causes children to act aggressively or causes other measurable harm to children;
::(ii) has a disproportionately harmful effect on children already prone to aggressive behavior or on other identifiable groups of children; and
::(iii) has a harmful effect that is distinguishable from any negative effects produced by other types of media;
:(B) whether any harm identified under subparagraph (A)(i)has a direct and long-lasting impact on a child's well-being; and
:(C) whether current or emerging characteristics of video games have a unique impact on children, considering in particular video games' interactive nature and the extraordinarily personal and vivid way violence might be portrayed in such video games.

==={{anchor|idBF0FFC544AD246B192C9E37EBC9B6C91}}(2) Violent video programming– ===

The study and investigation under subsection (a)shall include—
:(A) whether the exposure listed under subsection (a)(2)—
::(i) causes children to act aggressively or causes other measurable harm to children;
::(ii) has a disproportionately harmful effect on children already prone to aggressive behavior or on other identifiable groups of children; and
::(iii) has a harmful effect that is distinguishable from any negative effects produced by other types of media; and

==={{anchor|id5E00EC4E41DF441E8E484AABF4060F17}}(3) Future research– ===

The study and investigation under subsection (a)shall identify gaps in the current state of research which, if closed, could provide additional information regarding any causal connection—
:(A) between exposure to violent video games and behavior; and
:(B) between exposure to violent video programming and behavior.
