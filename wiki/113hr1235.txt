{{section|HB475219138524FBEAE2CBBDB95D7902E|2. State determination to exempt projects from certain FERC considerations in licensing}}
Section 4 of the
			 Federal Power Act
 (16 U.S.C. 797
)
 is amended by adding at the end the following
			 new subsection:
(h)
(1)
For the purposes of this
				subsection—
(A)
the term exempt State
 means a
				State for which a State law is in effect that expressly authorizes paragraph
				(2)
 to apply to projects within the State; and

(B)
the term public use and environmental
				purposes
 means the purposes of energy conservation, the protection,
				mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of, fish and wildlife (including
				related spawning grounds and habitat), the protection of recreational
				opportunities, the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality, and
				other beneficial public uses, including irrigation, flood control, water
				supply, and other purposes, as required under subsection (e)
 and section 10(a)
,
				as such purposes apply to land within the project boundary that is above the
				highest target elevation for normal operations of the project.


(2)
Notwithstanding subsection (e)
 and sections
				10(a)
 and 28
, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] may not consider public use and environmental
				purposes in issuing a license for a project in an exempt State.

(3)
If a State law described in paragraph
				(1)(A)
 is no longer in effect, paragraph (2)
 shall continue to apply to any
				project in the State for which a license was issued while such law was in
				effect.

(4)
Paragraph (2)
 shall not apply to any
				project or portion of a project on Federal
				land.
