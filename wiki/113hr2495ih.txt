=Sec. 3. Department of Energy high-end computing research and development program=

 Section 3 of the Department of Energy High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/5542 15 U.S.C. 5542] )is amended—
:(1) in subsection (a)—
::(A) in paragraph (1), by striking “program” and inserting “coordinated program across the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] ” ;
::(B) by striking “and” at the end of paragraph (1);
::(C) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2)and inserting “; and” ; and
::(D) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

<blockquote>
:::(3) partner with universities, National Laboratories, and industry to ensure the broadest possible application of the technology developed in this program to other challenges in science, engineering, medicine, and industry.;
</blockquote>

:(2) in subsection (b)(2), by striking “vector” and all that follows through “architectures” and inserting “computer technologies that show promise of substantial reductions in power requirements and substantial gains in parallelism of multicore processors, concurrency, memory and storage, bandwidth, and reliability” ; and
:(3) by striking subsection (d)and inserting the following:

<blockquote>

===(d) Exascale computing program– ===



====(1) In general– ====

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall conduct a coordinated research program to develop exascale computing systems to advance the missions of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] .

====(2) Execution– ====

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall, through competitive merit review, establish two or more National Laboratory-industry-university partnerships to conduct integrated research, development, and engineering of multiple exascale architectures, and—
:(A) conduct mission-related co-design activities in developing such exascale platforms;
:(B) develop those advancements in hardware and software technology required to fully realize the potential of an exascale production system in addressing [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] target applications and solving scientific problems involving predictive modeling and simulation and large-scale data analytics and management; and
:(C) explore the use of exascale computing technologies to advance a broad range of science and engineering.

====(3) Administration– ====

In carrying out this program, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall—
:(A) provide, on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis, access for researchers in United States industry, institutions of higher education, National Laboratories, and other Federal agencies to these exascale systems, as appropriate; and
:(B) conduct outreach programs to increase the readiness for the use of such platforms by domestic industries, including manufacturers.

====(4) Reports– ====



=====(A) Integrated strategy and program management plan– =====

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of the American Super Computing Leadership Act, a report outlining an integrated strategy and program management plan, including target dates for prototypical and production exascale platforms, interim milestones to reaching these targets, functional requirements, roles and responsibilities of National Laboratories and industry, acquisition strategy, and estimated resources required, to achieve this exascale system capability. The report shall include the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary's]] plan for Departmental organization to manage and execute the Exascale Computing Program, including definition of the roles and responsibilities within the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] to ensure an integrated program across the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] . The report shall also include a plan for ensuring balance and prioritizing across ASCR subprograms in a flat or slow-growth budget environment.

=====(B) Status reports– =====

At the time of the budget submission of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] for each fiscal year, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall submit a report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that describes the status of milestones and costs in achieving the objectives of the exascale computing program.

=====(C) Exascale merit report– =====

At least 18 months prior to the initiation of construction or installation of any exascale-class computing facility, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall transmit a plan to the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] detailing—
:(i) the proposed facility's cost projections and capabilities to significantly accelerate the development of new energy technologies;
:(ii) technical risks and challenges that must be overcome to achieve successful completion and operation of the facility; and
:(iii) an independent assessment of the scientific and technological advances expected from such a facility relative to those expected from a comparable investment in expanded research and applications at terascale-class and petascale-class computing facilities, including an evaluation of where investments should be made in the system software and algorithms to enable these advances..
