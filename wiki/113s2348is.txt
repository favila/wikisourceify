=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States, killing more non-smokers than any other cancer.
:(2) Every year, approximately 140,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 Americans will die from it.
:(3) Approximately 60 percent of colorectal cancer cases and 70 percent of deaths occur in those aged 65 and older.
:(4) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy allows for the detection and removal of polyps, or abnormal growths, that could become cancerous, as well as for the early detection of colorectal cancer when treatment can be most effective.
:(5) Although colorectal cancer is largely preventable, one in three adults between the recommended screening ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with colorectal cancer screening.
:(6) Dozens of organizations have committed to eliminating colorectal cancer as a major public health problem and are working toward the shared goal of reaching 80 percent screened for colorectal cancer by 2018.
:(7) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy is a highly effective preventive service, and removing financial barriers can help to increase screening rates.
