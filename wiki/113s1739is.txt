To modify the efficiency standards for grid-enabled water heaters.

=Section 1. Grid-enabled water heaters=

 Part B of title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6291 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq.] ] )is amended—
:(1) in section 325(e)( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6295 42 U.S.C. 6295(e)] ] ), by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>

===(6) Additional standards for grid-enabled water heaters– ===



====(A) Definitions– ====

In this paragraph:

=====(i) Activation key– =====

The term activation key means a physical device or control directly on the water heater, a software code, or a digital communication means—
:(I) that must be activated to enable the product to operate continuously and at its designed specifications and capabilities; and
:(II) without which activation the product will provide not greater than 50 percent of the rated first hour delivery of hot water certified by the manufacturer.

=====(ii) Grid-enabled water heater– =====

The term grid-enabled water heater means an electric resistance water heater that—
:(I) has a rated storage tank volume of more than 75 gallons;
:(II) is manufactured on or after April 16, 2015;
:(III) has—
::(aa) an energy factor of not less than 1.061 minus the product obtained by multiplying—
:::(AA) the rated storage volume of the tank, expressed in gallons; and
:::(BB) 0.00168; or
::(bb) an efficiency level equivalent to the energy factor under item (aa)and expressed as a uniform energy descriptor based on the revised test procedure for water heaters described in paragraph (5);
:(IV) is equipped by the manufacturer with an activation key; and
:(V) bears a permanent label applied by the manufacturer that—
::(aa) is made of material not adversely affected by water;
::(bb) is attached by means of non-water-soluble adhesive; and
::(cc) advises purchasers and end-users of the intended and appropriate use of the product with the following notice printed in 16.5 point Arial Narrow Bold font: “IMPORTANT INFORMATION: This water heater is intended only for use as part of an electric thermal storage or demand response program. It will not provide adequate hot water unless enrolled in such a program and activated by your utility company or another program operator. Confirm the availability of a program in your local area before purchasing or installing this product.” .

====(B) Requirement– ====

The manufacturer or private labeler shall provide the activation key only to utilities or other companies operating electric thermal storage or demand response programs that use grid-enabled water heaters.

====(C) Reports– ====



=====(i) Manufacturers– =====

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall require each manufacturer of grid-enabled water heaters to report to the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] annually the quantity of grid-enabled water heaters that the manufacturer ships each year.

=====(ii) Operators– =====

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall require utilities and other demand response and thermal storage program operators to report annually the quantity of grid-enabled water heaters activated for their programs using forms of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Energy Information Agency]] or using such other mechanism that the Secretary determines appropriate after an opportunity for notice and comment.

=====(iii) Confidentiality requirements– =====

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall treat shipment data reported by manufacturers as confidential business information.

====(D) Publication of information– ====



=====(i) In general– =====

In 2017 and 2019, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall publish an analysis of the data collected under subparagraph (C)to assess the extent to which shipped products are put into use in demand response and thermal storage programs.

=====(ii) Prevention of product diversion– =====

If the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] determines that sales of grid-enabled water heaters exceed by 15 percent or greater the quantity of such products activated for use in demand response and thermal storage programs annually, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall, after opportunity for notice and comment, establish procedures to prevent product diversion for non-program purposes.

====(E) Compliance– ====



=====(i) In general– =====

 Subparagraphs (A) through (D)shall remain in effect until the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] determines under this section that grid-enabled water heaters do not require a separate efficiency requirement.

=====(ii) Effective date– =====

If the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] exercises the authority described in clause (i)or amends the efficiency requirement for grid-enabled water heaters, that action will take effect on the date described in subsection (m)(4)(A)(ii).

=====(iii) Consideration– =====

In carrying out this section with respect to electric water heaters, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall consider the impact on thermal storage and demand response programs, including the consequent impact on energy savings, electric bills, electric reliability, integration of renewable resources, and the environment.

=====(iv) Requirements– =====

In carrying out this subparagraph, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall require that grid-enabled water heaters be equipped with communication capability to enable the grid-enabled water heaters to participate in ancillary services programs if the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] determines that the technology is available, practical, and cost-effective.; and
