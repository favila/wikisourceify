{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide for the extension of certain unemployment benefits, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Emergency unemployment compensation benefits expired at the end of 2013.
:(2) 1.3 million unemployed workers and their families immediately lost access to benefits. Thousands more unemployed workers are losing benefits each week.
:(3) Excluding title IV, which focuses on nutrition, the Agricultural Act of 2014 , which has passed the House, generates savings to offset the cost of this Act. If savings are not sufficient, Congress will direct offsets from other legislation to fully offset this Act.
:(4) Consistent with the statutory pay-as-you-go scorecard and the spirit of House rules that allow savings from one bill to be counted in evaluating language in another paired bill, the savings generated by the Agricultural Act of 2014 (not including title IV) provide an offset for the benefits provided in this Act.
