==Sec. 504. Sense of Senate on underutilized facilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and their potential use==



===(a) Findings– ===

The [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) is the ninth largest real property holder of the Federal Government, with more than 124,000 acres and more than 4,900 buildings and other structures with a replacement value of more than $30,000,000,000.
:(2) The annual operation and maintenance costs of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] have increased steadily, and, as of 2012, the Administration has more than $2,300,000,000 in annual deferred maintenance costs.
:(3) According to [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administration continues to retain real property that is underutilized, does not have identified future mission uses, or is duplicative of other assets in its real property inventory.
:(4) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Office of Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] have identified the aging and duplicative infrastructure of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] as a high priority and longstanding management challenge.
:(5) In the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] directed the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] to examine its real property assets and downsize to fit current and future missions and expected funding levels, paying particular attention to identifying and removing unneeded or duplicative infrastructure.
:(6) The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Office of Inspector General]] found at least 33 facilities, including wind tunnels, test stands, airfields, and launch infrastructure, that were underutilized or for which National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers could not identify a future mission use and that the need for these facilities have declined in recent years as a result of changes in the mission focus of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] , the condition and obsolescence of some facilities, and the advent of alternative testing methods.
:(7) The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Office of Inspector General]] found that the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] has taken steps to minimize the costs of continuing to maintain some of these facilities by placing them in an inactive state or leasing them to other parties.
:(8) The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] has a series of initiatives underway that, in the judgment of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Office of Inspector General]] , are “positive steps towards “rightsizing” its real property footprint” , and the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Office of Inspector General]] has concluded that “it is imperative that NASA move forward aggressively with its infrastructure reduction efforts” .
:(9) Existing and emerging United States commercial launch and exploration capabilities are providing cargo transportation to the International Space Station and offer the potential for providing crew support, access to the International Space Station, and missions to low Earth orbit while the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] focuses its efforts on heavy-lift capabilities and deep space missions.
:(10)  [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] facilities and property that are underutilized, duplicative, or no longer needed for [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] requirements could be utilized by commercial users and State and local entities, resulting in savings for the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] and a reduction in the burden of the Federal Government to fund space operations.

===(b) Sense of Senate– ===

It is the sense of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume—
:(1) the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] should move forward with plans to reduce its infrastructure and, to the greatest extent practicable, make property available for lease to a government or private tenant or report the property to the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] (GSA) for sale or transfer to another entity;
:(2) the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] should pursue opportunities for streamlined sale or lease of property and facilities, including for exclusive use, to a private entity, or expedited conveyance or transfer to a State or political subdivision, municipality, instrumentality of a State, or Department of Transportation-licensed launch site operators for the promotion of commercial or scientific space activity and for developing and operating space launch facilities; and
:(3) leasing or transferring underutilized facilities and properties to commercial space entities or State or local governments will reduce operation and maintenance costs for the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] , save money for the Federal Government, and promote commercial space and the exploration goals of the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] and the United States.Passed the Senate March 23 (legislative day, March 22), 2013.Secretary
