==Title I— Marketplace Fairness==



==Sec. 101. Authorization to require collection of sales and use taxes==


:(a) Streamlined sales and use tax agreement– Each Member State under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized to require all sellers not qualifying for the small seller exception described in subsection (c) to collect and remit sales and use taxes with respect to remote sales sourced to that Member State pursuant to the provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, but only if any changes to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement made after the date of the enactment of this Act are not in conflict with the minimum simplification requirements in subsection (b)(2) . Subject to section 102(h) , a State may exercise authority under this title beginning 180 days after the State publishes notice of the State’s intent to exercise the authority under this title.

===(b) Alternative– ===

A State that is not a Member State under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized notwithstanding any other provision of law to require all sellers not qualifying for the small seller exception described in subsection (c) to collect and remit sales and use taxes with respect to remote sales sourced to that State, but only if the State adopts and implements the minimum simplification requirements in paragraph (2) . Subject to section 102(h) , such authority shall commence beginning no earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least 6 months after the date that the State—
:(1) enacts legislation to exercise the authority granted by this title—
::(A) specifying the tax or taxes to which such authority and the minimum simplification requirements in paragraph (2) shall apply; and
::(B) specifying the products and services otherwise subject to the tax or taxes identified by the State under subparagraph (A) to which the authority of this title shall not apply; and
:(2) implements each of the following minimum simplification requirements:
::(A) Provide, with respect to all remote sales sourced to the State—
:::(i) a single entity within the State responsible for all State and local sales and use tax administration, return processing, and audits;
:::(ii) a single audit of a remote seller for all State and local taxing jurisdictions within that State; and
:::(iii) a single sales and use tax return to be used by remote sellers to be filed with the single entity responsible for tax administration.A State may not require a remote seller to file sales and use tax returns any more frequently than returns are required for nonremote sellers or impose requirements on remote sellers that the State does not impose on nonremote sellers with respect to the collection of sales and use taxes under this title. No local jurisdiction may require a remote seller to submit a sales and use tax return or to collect sales and use taxes other than as provided by this paragraph.
::(B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax base among the State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State with respect to products and services to which paragraph (1)(B) does not apply.
::(C) Source all remote sales in compliance with the sourcing definition set forth in section 103(7) .
::(D) 
:::(i) Make publicly available information indicating the taxability of products and services along with any product and service exemptions from sales and use tax in the State and a rates and boundary database.
:::(ii) Provide software free of charge for remote sellers that calculates sales and use taxes due on each transaction at the time the transaction is completed, that files sales and use tax returns, and that is updated to reflect any rate changes and any changes to the products and services specified under paragraph (1)(B) , as described in subparagraph (H) ; and
:::(iii) Establish certification procedures for persons to be approved as certified software providers, with any software provided by such providers to be capable of calculating and filing sales and use taxes in all States qualified under this title.
::(E) Relieve remote sellers from liability to the State or locality for the incorrect collection, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the result of an error or omission made by a certified software provider.
::(F) Relieve certified software providers from liability to the State or locality for the incorrect collection, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the result of misleading or inaccurate information provided by a remote seller.
::(G) Relieve remote sellers and certified software providers from liability to the State or locality for incorrect collection, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the result of incorrect information or software provided by the State.
::(H) Provide remote sellers and certified software providers with 90 days notice of any rate change or any change to the products and services specified under paragraph (1)(B) by the State or any locality in the State and update the information described in subparagraph (D)(i) accordingly and relieve any remote seller or certified software provider from liability for collecting sales and use taxes at the immediately preceding effective rate during the 90-day notice period if the required notice is not provided.

===(c) Small seller exception– ===

A State is authorized to require a remote seller to collect sales and use taxes under this title only if the remote seller has gross annual receipts in total remote sales in the United States in the preceding calendar year exceeding $1,000,000. For purposes of determining whether the threshold in this section is met, the gross annual receipts from remote sales of 2 or more persons shall be aggregated if—
:(1) such persons are related to the remote seller within the meaning of subsections (b) and (c) of section 267 or  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/707 section 707(b)(1)]of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ; or
