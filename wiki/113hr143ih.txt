::::(I) the deficit for the fiscal year referred to in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8432 clause (i)] (as set forth in the concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year), is less than
::::(II) the deficit for the preceding fiscal year (as set forth in the concurrent resolution on the budget for such preceding fiscal year).
::(B) If a determination under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8432 subparagraph (A)(ii)] cannot be made with respect to a fiscal year (as referred to in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8432 subclause (I)] thereof) due to a failure by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to complete action on a concurrent resolution on the budget for the preceding fiscal year (as referred to in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8432 subclause (II)] thereof) the condition under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8432 subparagraph (A)(ii)] shall be considered not to have been met for purposes of the fiscal year referred to in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8432 subclause (I)] thereof.
