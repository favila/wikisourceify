{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend the program for viral hepatitis surveillance, education, and testing in order to prevent deaths from chronic liver disease and liver cancer, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Viral Hepatitis Testing Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Approximately 5,300,000 Americans are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (referred to in this section as “HBV” ), the hepatitis C virus (referred to in this section as “HCV” ), or both.
:(2) In the United States, chronic HBV and HCV are among the most common causes of liver cancer, one of the most lethal and fastest growing cancers in the United States. Chronic HBV and HCV are among the most common causes of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and the most common indication for liver transplantation. More than 15,000 deaths per year in the United States can be attributed to chronic HBV and HCV. Chronic HCV is also a leading cause of death in Americans living with HIV/AIDS. Many of those living with HIV/AIDS are coinfected with chronic HBV, HCV, or both.
:(3) According to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (referred to in this section as the CDC ), approximately 2 percent of the population of the United States is living with chronic HBV, HCV, or both. The CDC has recognized HCV as the Nation’s most common chronic bloodborne virus infection.
:(4) HBV is easily transmitted and is 100 times more infectious than HIV. According to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] , HBV is transmitted through contact with infectious blood, semen, or other body fluids. HCV is transmitted by contact with infectious blood, particularly through percutaneous exposures (i.e. puncture through the skin).
:(5) The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] conservatively estimates that in 2011 approximately 16,600 Americans were newly infected with HCV and more than 18,800 Americans were newly infected with HBV. These estimates could be much higher due to many reasons, including lack of screening education and awareness, and perceived marginalization of the populations at risk.
:(6) In 2012 [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] released new guidelines recommending every person born from 1945 through 1965 receive a one-time HCV test. Among the estimated 102 million (1.6 million chronically HCV-infected) eligible for screening, birth-cohort screening leads to 74,000 fewer cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 46,000 fewer cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 15,000 fewer liver transplants and 120,000 fewer HCV-related deaths versus risk-based screening.
:(7) In 2013, the United States Preventative Task Force (USPSTF) issued a Grade B rating for screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in persons at high risk for infection and adults born between 1945 and 1965. In 2009, the USPSTF issued a Grade A for screening pregnant women for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) during their first prenatal visit.
:(8) There were 35 outbreaks (19 of HBV, 16 of HCV) reported to [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] for investigation from 2008–2012 related to healthcare acquired infection of HBV and HCV, 33 of which occurred in non-hospital settings. There were more than 99,975 patients potentially exposed to one of the viruses.
:(9) Chronic HBV and chronic HCV usually do not cause symptoms early in the course of the disease, but after many years of a clinically silent phase, [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] estimates show more than 33 percent of infected individuals will develop cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or liver cancer. Since most individuals with chronic HBV, HCV, or both are unaware of their infection, they do not know to take precautions to prevent the spread of their infection and can unknowingly exacerbate their own disease progression.
:(10) HBV and HCV disproportionately affect certain populations in the United States. Although representing about 6 percent of the population, Asian and Pacific Islanders account for over half of up to 1,400,000 domestic chronic HBV cases. Baby boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965) account for more than 75 percent of domestic chronic HCV cases. In addition, African-Americans, Latinos (Latinas), and American Indian/Native Alaskans are among the groups which have disproportionately high rates of HBV infections, HCV infections, or both in the United States.
:(11) For both chronic HBV and chronic HCV, behavioral changes can slow disease progression if a diagnosis is made early. Early diagnosis, which is determined through simple diagnostic tests, can also reduce the risk of transmission and disease progression through education and vaccination of household members and other susceptible persons at risk.
:(12) Advancements have led to the development of improved diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis. These tests, including rapid, point of care testing and others in development, can facilitate testing, notification of results and post-test counseling, and referral to care at the time of the testing visit. In particular, these tests are also advantageous because they can be used simultaneously with HIV rapid testing for persons at risk for both HCV and HIV infections.
:(13) For those chronically infected with HBV or HCV, regular monitoring can lead to the early detection of liver cancer at a stage where a cure is still possible. Liver cancer is the second deadliest cancer in the United States; however, liver cancer has received little funding for research, prevention, or treatment.
:(14) Treatment for chronic HCV can eradicate the disease in approximately 75 percent of those currently treated. The treatment of chronic HBV can effectively suppress viral replication in the overwhelming majority (over 80 percent) of those treated, thereby reducing the risk of transmission and progression to liver scarring or liver cancer, even though a complete cure is much less common than for HCV.
:(15) To combat the viral hepatitis epidemic in the United States, in May 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services released, Combating the Silent Epidemic of Viral Hepatitis: Action Plan for the Prevention, Care & Treatment of Viral Hepatitis. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies produced a 2010 report on the Federal response to HBV and HCV titled: Hepatitis and Liver Cancer: A National Strategy for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis B and C. The recommendations and guidelines provide a framework for HBV and HCV prevention, education, control, research, and medical management programs.
:(16) The annual health care costs attributable to viral hepatitis in the United States are significant. For HBV, it is estimated to be approximately $2,500,000,000 ($2,000 per infected person). In 2000, the lifetime cost of HBV—before the availability of most current therapies—was approximately $80,000 per chronically infected person, totaling more than $100,000,000,000. For HCV, medical costs for patients are expected to increase from $30,000,000,000 in 2009 to over $85,000,000,000 in 2024. Avoiding these costs by screening and diagnosing individuals earlier—and connecting them to appropriate treatment and care will save lives and critical health care dollars. Currently, without a comprehensive screening, testing and diagnosis program, most patients are diagnosed too late when they need a liver transplant costing at least $314,000 for uncomplicated cases or when they have liver cancer or end stage liver disease which costs between $30,980 to $110,576 per hospital admission. As health care costs continue to grow, it is critical that the Federal Government invests in effective mechanisms to avoid documented cost drivers.
:(17) According to the Institute of Medicine report in 2010 (described in paragraph (13)), chronic HBV and HCV infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality despite being preventable and treatable. Deficiencies in the implementation of established guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and medical management of chronic HBV and HCV infections perpetuate personal and economic burdens. Existing grants are not sufficient to address the scale of the health burden presented by HBV and HCV.
:(18) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] has the discretion to carry out this Act directly and through whichever of the agencies of the [[w:United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] determines to be appropriate, which may (in the Secretary’s discretion) include the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] , the [[w:Health Resources and Services Administration|Health Resources and Services Administration]] , the [[w:Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] , the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]] (including the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities), and other agencies of such Service.
:(19) For over a decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Viral Hepatitis Prevention Coordinator (VHPC) program has been the only national program dedicated to the prevention and control of the viral hepatitis epidemics administering the duties currently specified by Section 317N of the Public Health Service Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/247b–15 42 U.S.C. 247b–15] )at State and local health departments. VHPCs provide the technical expertise necessary for the management and coordination of activities to prevent viral hepatitis infection and disease with little to no Federal funding for program implementation or development. Further, these coordinators help integrate viral hepatitis prevention services into health care settings and public health programs that serve adults at risk for viral hepatitis.
