{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish a comprehensive United States Government policy to assist countries in sub-Saharan Africa to develop an appropriate mix of power solutions for more broadly distributed electricity access in order to support poverty alleviation and drive economic growth, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Electrify Africa Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to improve access to affordable, reliable electricity in Africa in order to unlock the potential for economic growth, job creation, food security, improved health and education outcomes, and sustainable poverty reduction. 

=Sec. 3. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) 589,000,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, or 68 percent of the population, do not have access to electricity, as of 2010;
:(2) electricity services are highly unreliable and remain at least twice as expensive compared to other emerging regions for the majority of people with access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa;
:(3) lack of access to electricity services dis­pro­por­tion­al­ly affects women—who often shoulder the burden of seeking sources of heat and light such as dung, wood or charcoal and are often more exposed to the associated negative health impacts. Women and girls also face increase risks of assault from walking long distances to gather fuel sources;
:(4) people without access to electricity are often trapped in subsistence lifestyles and are unable to work their way out of poverty;
:(5) a lack of electricity contributes to the high use of inefficient and often highly polluting fuel sources for indoor cooking, heating, and lighting that produce toxic fumes resulting in more than 3,000,000 annual premature deaths from respiratory disease, more annual deaths than from HIV/AIDS and malaria in sub-Saharan Africa;
:(6) electricity access is crucial for the storage of vaccines and anti-retroviral and other lifesaving medical drugs, as well as the operation of modern lifesaving medical equipment;
:(7) electricity access can be used to improve food security by enabling post-harvest processing, pumping, irrigation, dry grain storage, milling, refrigeration, and other uses;
:(8) electricity access can provide improved lighting options, internet access, mobile phone charging, and other new information and communication technologies that can greatly improve health and education outcomes as well as commercial possibilities;
:(9) Africa’s consumer base of 1,000,000,000 people is rapidly growing and will create increasing demand for United States goods, services, and technologies, but the current African electricity deficit limits this growth in demand by restricting economic growth on the continent;
:(10) approximately 30 African countries face endemic power shortages, and nearly 70 percent of surveyed African businesses cite unreliable power as a major constraint to growth;
:(11) the [[w:|Millennium Challenge Corporation’s]]work in the energy sector shows high projected economic rates of returns that translate to sustainable economic growth and that the highest returns are projected when infrastructure improvements are coupled with significant legislative and regulatory and institutional policy reforms;
:(12) in some countries, regulatory bottlenecks and legal constraints stifle the ability of private investment to assist in the generation and distribution of electricity; and
:(13) without new policies and more effective investments in electricity sector enterprises to increase and expand electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa, over 70 percent of the rural population, and 48 percent of the total population, will remain without access to electricity by 2030. 

=Sec. 4. Statement of policy=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]declares that it is the policy of the United States, in consultation with sub-Saharan African governments, to—
:(1) encourage the installation of at least an additional 20,000 megawatts of electrical power in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020;
:(2) promote first-time access to electricity for at least 50,000,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 in both urban and rural areas; and
:(3) promote efficient institutional platforms to provide electrical service to rural and underserved areas.
