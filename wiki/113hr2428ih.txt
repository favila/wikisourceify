For purposes of the calculation required under paragraph (1), the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]] shall multiply the deck area of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges in each category described in subparagraph (A)by the respective unit price on a State-by-State basis, as determined by the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]] , to determine the total cost to rehabilitate or replace bridges in each State.
