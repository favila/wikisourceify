 United States international programming to Ukraine and neighboring regions.   

=Section 1. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS=


:(a)   [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds and declares the following:
::(1) The Russian Government has deliberately blocked the Ukrainian people's access to uncensored sources of information and has provided alternative news and information that is both inaccurate and inflammatory.
::(2) United States international programming exists to advance the United States interests and values by presenting accurate and comprehensive news and information, which is the foundation for democratic governance.
::(3) The opinions and views of the Ukrainian people, especially those people located in the eastern regions and Crimea, are not being accurately represented in Russian dominated mass media.
::(4) Russian forces have seized more than five television stations in Crimea and taken over transmissions, switching to a 24/7 Russian propaganda format; this increase in programming augments the already robust pro-Russian programming to Ukraine.
::(5) United States international programming has the potential to combat this anti-democratic propaganda.

:(3) prioritize programming to areas where access to uncensored sources of information is limited or non-existent, especially populations serviced by Russian supported media outlets;
:(4) increase the number of reporters and organizational presence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Crimea;
:(5) promote democratic processes, respect for human rights, freedom of the press, and territorial sovereignty; and

:(3) provide programming content 24 hours a day, seven days a week to target populations, using all available and effective distribution outlets, including—
::(A) at least 8 weekly hours of total original television and video content in Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages, not inclusive of live video streaming coverage of breaking news, to be distributed on satellite, digital, and through regional television affiliates by the Voice of America; and
::(B) at least 14 weekly hours the total audio content in Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages to be distributed on satellite, digital, and through regional radio affiliates of RFE/RL, Incorporated;
:(4) expand the use, audience, and audience engagement of mobile news and multimedia platforms by RFE/RL, Incorporated, and the Voice of America, including through Internet-based social networking platforms; and
