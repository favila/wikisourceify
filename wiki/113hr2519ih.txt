{{Center|A BILL}}

 To direct the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) From 1961 to 1971, approximately 19,000,000 gallons of 15 different herbicides were sprayed over the southern region of Vietnam. The agents included 13,000,000 gallons of Agent Orange, 4,500,000 gallons of Agent White, 1,000,000 gallons of Agent Blue, 420,000 gallons of Agent Purple, and relatively smaller quantities of the other herbicides. Many of the herbicides, including Agents Orange, Purple, Green, Pink, Dinoxol, and Trinoxol contained the toxic contaminant dioxin (TCDD). One, Agent Blue, contained high levels of arsenic. The aforementioned 15 herbicides, including the contaminant dioxin, are usually collectively referred to as Agent Orange.
:(2) Studies show that between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 Vietnamese and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to Agent Orange during the spraying. Many other Vietnamese were or continue to be exposed to Agent Orange through contact with the environment and food that was contaminated or as offspring of those exposed who now suffer from illnesses and disabilities.
:(3) Today, there are still dozens of environmental hot spots that continue to contaminate the food, soil, sediment, livestock, and wildlife with Agent Orange.
:(4) Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively affect the lives of men and women in Vietnam and in the United States. The lives of many victims, including Vietnamese, United States veterans and their offspring, and Vietnamese-Americans, are cut short and others live with disease, disabilities, and pain, often untreated or unrecognized.
:(5) The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes certain illnesses and diseases, including AL amyloidosis, chronic B-cell leukemia, chloracne, diabetes mellitus type 2, Hodgkin’s disease, ischemic heart disease, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Parkinson’s disease, acute and sub-acute peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, and soft-tissue sarcomas as associated with the spraying and use of Agent Orange by the United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam era.
:(6) No similar consideration has been given to affected Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans.
:(7) The Department of Veterans Affairs provides compensation for many severe birth defects among the children of American women veterans who served in Vietnam. The list of birth defects covered includes but is not limited to: achondroplasia, cleft lip, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), esophageal and intestinal atresia, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, hip dysplasia, Hirschsprung's disease (congenital megacolon), hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis, hypospadias, imperforate anus, neural tube defects, Poland syndrome, pyloric stenosis, syndactyly (fused digits), tracheoesophageal fistula, undescended testes, and Williams syndrome. Affected children of these women veterans receive medical care and other benefits.
:(8) The only birth defect recognized for the children of male American veterans is spina bifida (but not occulta), resulting in most affected children receiving no benefits.
:(9) No assistance has been given to the children of male or female Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans connected with their exposure, or their parent’s or grandparent’s exposure.
:(10) The Institute of Medicine for the past several years has noted that“it is considerably more plausible than previously believed that exposure to the herbicides sprayed in Vietnam might have caused paternally mediated transgenerational effects … attributable to the TCCD contaminant in Agent Orange.”In recent years, scientific studies have identified likely epigenetic links between exposure to toxins and birth defects and developmental disorders in subsequent generations. Some of the children and grandchildren of exposed persons (Americans, Vietnamese, and Vietnamese-Americans) who were in southern Vietnam during the Vietnam era likely suffer from disorders, birth defects, and illnesses related to Agent Orange.
:(11) Dating back to 2007, the United States has engaged in environmental remediation of contamination at the Da Nang and Bien Hoa airports, and provided funds for public health and disabilities activities for individuals residing in some affected areas.

==(b) Purpose– ==
