{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish the Commission on America and its Veterans.

=Section 1. Establishment of Commission=

There is established an independent commission in the executive branch to be known as the “ [[w:|Commission on America and its Veterans]] ” (referred to in this Act as the “Commission” ).

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) After more than a decade of war, and much work to help members of the Armed Forces returning home from the battlefield, the United States needs a wider and more thorough process for welcoming members back, taking care of their needs, and reintegrating them into society.
:(2) Many initiatives exist that provide help for the men and women who have fought, but there are gaps in our support for veterans that need to be addressed.
:(3) The United States has waged wars, but not all are involved in fighting those wars, and the United States needs to be more deeply and regularly connected with members and their experiences in war and returning from war.
:(4) Veterans contribute mightily to the society of the United States but many veterans endure ongoing psychological trauma, challenges with employment, crime and dislocation, and veterans’ families and communities are also faced with the after-effects of war in ways that need to be publicly addressed.
:(5) The Nation needs a whole-of-society approach to improving the veteran’s position in society, and improving how we welcome veterans when they return, and improving veterans’ experience when they come back, and do so in a way that helps veterans, their families, and their communities.
