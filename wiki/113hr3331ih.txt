[[w:Carolyn Maloney|Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York]] (for herself,
[[w:Maxine Waters|Ms. Waters]] ,
[[w:Gwen Moore|Ms. Moore]] , and
[[w:Mike Capuano|Mr. Capuano]] ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title 31, United States Code, to ensure that persons who form corporations or limited liability companies in the United States disclose the beneficial owners of those corporations or limited liability companies, in order to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations and limited liability companies for criminal gain, to assist law enforcement in detecting, preventing, and punishing terrorism, money laundering, and other misconduct involving United States corporations and limited liability companies, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Nearly 2,000,000 corporations and limited liability companies are being formed under the laws of the States each year.
:(2) Very few States obtain meaningful information about the beneficial owners of the corporations and limited liability companies formed under their laws.
:(3) A person forming a corporation or limited liability company within the United States typically provides less information to the State of incorporation than is needed to obtain a bank account or driver's license and typically does not name a single beneficial owner.
:(4) Criminals have exploited the weaknesses in State formation procedures to conceal their identities when forming corporations or limited liability companies in the United States, and have then used the newly created entities to commit crimes affecting interstate and international commerce such as terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, securities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of foreign corruption.
:(5) Law enforcement efforts to investigate corporations and limited liability companies suspected of committing crimes have been impeded by the lack of available beneficial ownership information, as documented in reports and testimony by officials from the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] , the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] , the [[w:|Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury]] , the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] , and the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] , and others.
:(6) In July 2006, a leading international anti-money laundering organization, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (in this section referred to as the FATF ), of which the United States is a member, issued a report that criticizes the United States for failing to comply with a FATF standard on the need to collect beneficial ownership information and urged the United States to correct this deficiency by July 2008.
:(7) In response to the FATF report, the United States has repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their incorporation practices by obtaining beneficial ownership information for the corporations and limited liability companies formed under the laws of such States.
:(8) Many States have established automated procedures that allow a person to form a new corporation or limited liability company within the State within 24 hours of filing an online application, without any prior review of the application by a State official. In exchange for a substantial fee, 2 States will form a corporation within 1 hour of a request.
:(9) Dozens of Internet Web sites highlight the anonymity of beneficial owners allowed under the incorporation practices of some States, point to those practices as a reason to incorporate in those States, and list those States together with offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations for the formation of new corporations, essentially providing an open invitation to criminals and other wrongdoers to form entities within the United States.
:(10) In contrast to practices in the United States, all 28 countries in the European Union are required to have formation agents identify the beneficial owners of the corporations formed under the laws of the country.
:(11) To reduce the vulnerability of the United States to wrongdoing by United States corporations and limited liability companies with hidden owners, to protect interstate and international commerce from criminals misusing United States corporations and limited liability companies, to strengthen law enforcement investigations of suspect corporations and limited liability companies, to set minimum standards for and level the playing field among State incorporation practices, and to bring the United States into compliance with its international anti-money laundering standards, Federal legislation is needed to require the States to obtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations and limited liability companies formed under the laws of such States.
