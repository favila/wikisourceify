[[w:Suzanne Bonamici|Ms. Bonamici]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]] , and in addition to the Committee on [[w:United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means]] , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned}}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a grant program to issue grants to institutions of higher education to support student internships.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Opportunities for Success Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Internships are increasingly important to the ability of college students to gain skills, make professional connections, and find jobs after graduation.
:(2) In 2011, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, employers offered full-time positions to 61.2 percent of their interns with an acceptance rate of 86.5 percent.
:(3) Many students struggle to make ends meet; 66 percent of young community college students dedicate more than 20 hours a week to an outside job, and the need of many students to maintain a part-time or full-time job reduces or eliminates the time available for an internship.
:(4) Internships often require significant time commitments or temporary relocation, which many students are unable to afford; these additional living expenses include housing, meals, and travel, and these costs make unpaid internships with employers like non-profit organizations and government even more inaccessible for those with low and middle incomes.
:(5) In 2011, 46 percent of students who had completed an internship were offered jobs, compared with 31 percent of students who did not complete an internship; more than 76 percent of employers rank relevant experience as the most important quality when hiring.
:(6) Many university officials and employers acknowledge that participating in an undergraduate internship is extremely helpful for finding meaningful employment in today’s job market.
