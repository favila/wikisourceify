=Sec. 3. Regulatory analysis by independent agencies=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]may by Executive order require an independent regulatory agency to comply, to the extent permitted by law, with regulatory analysis requirements applicable to other agencies, including the requirements to—
:(1) identify the problem that the agency intends to address by a new rule (including, where applicable, the failures of private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action) and assess the significance of that problem;
:(2) examine whether any existing rule (or other law) has created, or contributed to, the problem that a new rule is intended to correct and whether the existing rule (or other law) should be modified to achieve the intended goal of the new rule more effectively;
:(3) identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior, or providing information upon which choices can be made by the public;
:(4) consider to the extent reasonable in setting regulatory priorities, the degree and nature of the risks posed by various substances or activities within its jurisdiction;
:(5) design its rules in the most cost-effective manner to achieve the regulatory objective and, in doing so, consider incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability, the costs of enforcement and compliance (to the Federal Government, regulated entities, and the public), flexibility, distributive impacts, and equity;
:(6) assess the costs and the benefits of the intended rule and, recognizing some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt a rule only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the rule justify its costs;
:(7) base its rulemaking decisions on the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other information concerning the need for, and consequences of, the intended rule;
:(8) identify and assess alternative forms of regulation and, to the extent feasible, specify performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt;
:(9) seek the views of appropriate State, local, and tribal officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect State, local, or tribal governmental entities, whenever feasible;
:(10) avoid rules that are inconsistent or incompatible with, or duplicative of, other rules of the independent regulatory agency or other agencies;
:(11) tailor rules to impose the least burden on society, including individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other entities (including small communities and governmental entities), consistent with achieving the regulatory objectives, and taking into account, among other factors, and to the extent practicable, the cost of cumulative rules;
:(12) draft each rule to be simple and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing the potential for uncertainty and litigation arising from uncertainty; and
:(13) periodically review its existing economically significant rules to determine whether any such rules should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.

==(b) Economically significant rules– ==

For any proposed or final rule identified by an independent regulatory agency as, or determined by the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]]to be, an economically significant rule, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]may by Executive order require the independent regulatory agency to provide to the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]]and publish with the proposed and final rule the following information, to the extent permitted by law:
:(1) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of benefits anticipated from the rule together with, to the extent feasible, a quantification of those benefits.
:(2) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of costs anticipated from the rule together with, to the extent feasible, a quantification of those costs.
:(3) An assessment, including the underlying analysis, of costs and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives to the rule, identified by the agencies or the public, including improving existing regulations and reasonably viable nonregulatory actions, and an explanation why the planned regulatory action is preferable to the identified potential alternatives.

==(c) Review by office of information and regulatory affairs– ==



===(1) Requirement to seek review– ===

The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]may, by Executive order, require an independent regulatory agency to submit to the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]]for review—

:(B) any final economically significant rule, prior to publication of the final rule.

===(2) Nonbinding assessment– ===

An Executive order issued under this Act may require that, not later than 90 days after the independent regulatory agency submits a proposed or final economically significant rule for review, the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]]submit for inclusion in the rulemaking record the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator’s]]assessment of the extent to which the agency has complied with any of the regulatory analysis requirements made applicable by Executive order.

===(3) Determination and explanation by independent agency– ===

An Executive order issued under this Act may require that, if the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]]concludes under paragraph (2) that the independent regulatory agency did not comply with one or more requirements of the Executive order with respect to a proposed or final economically significant rule, the head of the agency that issued the economically significant rule shall include with the final rule—
:(A) a determination that the rule complies with the specified requirement or requirements and an explanation of that determination; and
:(B) if applicable, an explanation why the independent regulatory agency did not comply with one or more of the specified requirements, based on the statutory provision authorizing the rule.
