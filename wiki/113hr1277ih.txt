::(2) 
:::(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if an individual tests positive pursuant to paragraph (1)for the use of any drug listed in paragraph (3)(A), no regular compensation may be paid to the individual unless—
::::(i) a 30-day period has elapsed since the results of the test were determined; and
::::(ii) the individual tests negative for the use of each drug listed in paragraph (3)(A)at the end of such period.
:::(B) If an individual tests positive pursuant to paragraph (1)for the use of any drug listed in paragraph (3)(A)three or more times (whether for the same or a different drug), no regular compensation may be paid to the individual unless—
::::(i) a 5-year period has elapsed since the results of the last test were determined; and
::::(ii) the individual tests negative for the use of each drug listed in paragraph (3)(A)at the end of such period.
::(3) 
:::(A) In conducting drug testing pursuant to paragraph (1), the State shall test for each of the following:

::(4) The State shall require each individual who is tested pursuant to paragraph (1)to pay the portion of the cost of the drug testing that pertains to such individual. If such individual tests negative for the use of each drug listed in paragraph (3)(A)and the State provides regular compensation to the individual, the State shall increase the first payment of such compensation in an amount equal to the amount paid by the individual under this paragraph for the drug testing.
