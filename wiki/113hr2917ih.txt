{{Center|A BILL}}

 To promote savings by providing a tax credit for eligible taxpayers who contribute to savings products and to facilitate taxpayers receiving this credit and open a designated savings product when they file their Federal income tax returns.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Financial Security Credit Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The personal savings rate reached historic lows in the past decade, and a lack of personal savings was a major contributor to the depth and severity of the recession of 2007–2009.
:(2) Households continue to lack the savings or structures to meet short-term and long-term needs, as evidenced by the following:
::(A) According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, among full-time, full-year wage and salary workers ages 21–64, only 54.5 per cent participated in a retirement plan in 2010.
::(B) According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s 2011 Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, an estimated 8.2 percent of United States households, approximately 10 million households, are unbanked. These households do not have a checking or savings account. In total, 29.3 percent of households do not have a savings account.
::(C) More than 1 in 4 American households lives in asset poverty , meaning they lack the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. If assets that cannot easily be converted to cash, are excluded, such as a home or a business, as many as 4 in 10 households live in liquid asset poverty , meaning they lack the cash savings to survive three months at the poverty line.
:(3) Savings make families more resilient to financial shocks and more upwardly mobile, as evidenced by the following:
::(A) Even small sums of savings, $2,000 or less, have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of negative financial or material outcomes, such as foregoing adequate nutrition.
::(B) Children born to low-income, high saving parents are much more likely (71 percent) to move up the economic ladder than children born to low-income, low-saving parents (50 percent) over a generation.
:(4) Successful pilot programs have been run in cities as diverse as Houston, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; New York City, New York; San Antonio, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. These programs, run through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites serving only a fraction of potentially eligible tax filers in each city, have shown that tax filers with low incomes can and will save when presented with the right incentive at the right moment.
:(5) It is in the economic interests of the United States to promote savings among all members of society, regardless of income.
