{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any comprehensive plan to reform our national energy policy must promote the expanded use of renewable and alternative energy sources; increase our domestic refining capacity; promote conservation and increased energy efficiency; expand research and development, including domestic exploration; and enhance consumer education.Whereas the United States consumes roughly an average of 18,949,000 barrels of oil per day;Whereas the global average of daily oil consumption stands at 87,421,000 barrels of oil per day;Whereas the United States total annual energy consumption is approximately 94.547 quadrillion BTU, with the global total annual energy consumption at 482.872 quadrillion BTU;Whereas the United States share of world energy consumption is projected to fall from 19.5 percent in 2009 to 14.8 percent in 2035;Whereas according to the International Energy Agency, China surpassed the United States in energy consumption in 2009 and the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]] projects China’s energy consumption to exceed that of the United States between the years 2015 and 2020;Whereas the United States has an estimated 235-year coal reserve, coal is the most abundant and efficient domestic fuel source, and processes such as gasification and liquefaction offer cleaner alternatives for utilizing this resource;Whereas renewable sources of energy account for 8.090 quadrillion BTU per year in the United States; andWhereas such sources such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, solar, and wind need and deserve our attention and the necessary resources to encourage their commercial viability: Now, therefore, be it

:(2) Using recent technological innovations to exploit our vast supply of natural gas.
:(3) Increasing our domestic oil production and refining capacity.
:(4) Expanding use of renewable and alternative energy sources, with a focus on nuclear energy.
:(5) Promoting and providing incentives for an increase in conservation and energy efficiency.
:(6) Expanding and promoting additional research and development through new and innovative methods such as public-private partnerships.
