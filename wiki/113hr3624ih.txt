[[w:Steve Israel|Mr. Israel]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]  }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To direct the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to revise the Federal regulations applicable to the declaration of the trans fat content of a food on the label and in the labeling of the food when such content is less than 0.5 gram.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Trans Fat Truth in Labeling Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies advises the United States Government on nutritional science for use in the formation of public policy, including product labeling programs.
:(2) In 2002, the Institute of Medicine—
::(A) issued recommended dietary reference intake amounts for energy, carbohydrates, fiber, fat, fatty acids, cholesterol, protein, and amino acids; and
::(B) made recommendations regarding consumption of trans fat.
:(3) These recommendations included the following statement:“trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health”.
:(4) The Institute of Medicine concluded that—
::(A) both saturated and trans fats increase levels of LDL cholesterol; and
::(B) trans fats may also lower levels of HDL cholesterol.
:(5) A 2006 New England Journal of Medicine scientific review stated that“from a nutritional standpoint, the consumption of trans fatty acids results in considerable potential harm but no apparent benefit”.
:(6) Based on this overwhelming scientific evidence, in 2013, the Food and Drug Administration issued a preliminary determination that partially hydrogenated oils, which are the primary dietary source of artificial trans fats, are not“generally recognized as safe”for use as an ingredient in food.
:(7) Notwithstanding such preliminary determination, certain foods will still contain a certain level of naturally-occurring trans fats, and current laws and regulations, which only require that the labeling of food containing a certain threshold amount of trans fats bear that fact, will remain in effect. 

=Sec. 3. Declaration of trans fat content of less than 0.5 gram per serving on the label or in the labeling of food=



==(a) Requirement– ==

Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Commissioner of Food and Drugs]] shall promulgate a final regulation, revising[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/101 section 101.9(c)(2)(ii)]of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and such other regulatory provisions as may be necessary, to—
:(1) require that the nutrition information on the label or labeling on an applicable food contain an asterisk or another similar notation and a note to indicate that the food has a low trans fat content per serving; and
:(2) prohibit the label or labeling on an applicable food from indicating that trans fat content per serving is zero.

==(b) Applicable food– ==

For purposes of this section, the term applicable food means a food for which—
:(1) the trans fat content of a serving of the food is less than 0.5 gram and greater than 0.0 gram; and
:(2) the trans fat content of a serving of the food is declared in the nutrition information on the label or in the labeling of the food.

==(c) Effective date– ==

The regulation promulgated under subsection (a) shall take effect on the date that is 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.
