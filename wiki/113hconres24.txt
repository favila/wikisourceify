{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of Congress that a
		  carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released
			 from fossil fuels;Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices,
			 including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating
			 oil;Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers
			 will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity;Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the
			 elderly, and those on fixed incomes;Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses
			 moving overseas;Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic
			 growth;Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a
			 carbon tax;Whereas, according to the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information
			 Administration]], in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 82
			 percent;Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost
			 of every good manufactured in the United States;Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens
			 on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further
			 restrict the global competitiveness of the United States;Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in
			 energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic
			 energy resources on private and State-owned land which has created significant
			 job growth and private capital investment;Whereas United States energy policy should encourage
			 continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the
			 existing tax burden on manufacturers;Whereas the production of American energy resources
			 increases the United States ability to maintain a competitive advantage in
			 today’s global economy;Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America’s global
			 competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not
			 impose this exorbitant tax burden; andWhereas the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] should focus on
			 pro-growth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic
			 resources: Now, therefore, be it

={{anchor|H5AD553F8709648EF84C58CBCB5D92343}} =

That it is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that a
			 carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not
			 in the best interest of the United States.
