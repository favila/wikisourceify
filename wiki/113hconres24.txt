{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels;Whereas a carbon tax will increase energy prices, including the price of gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil;Whereas a carbon tax will mean that families and consumers will pay more for essentials like food, gasoline, and electricity;Whereas a carbon tax will fall hardest on the poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes;Whereas a carbon tax will lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas;Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth;Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a carbon tax;Whereas, according to the [[Wikipedia:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration ]], in 2011, fossil fuels share of energy consumption was 82 percent;Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good manufactured in the United States;Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further restrict the global competitiveness of the United States;Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy exploration and development and has increased production of domestic energy resources on private and State-owned land which has created significant job growth and private capital investment;Whereas United States energy policy should encourage continued private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing tax burden on manufacturers;Whereas the production of American energy resources increases the United States ability to maintain a competitive advantage in today’s global economy;Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America’s global competitiveness and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden; andWhereas the [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]and the [[Wikipedia:Executive Office of the President|President ]]should focus on pro-growth solutions that encourage increased development of domestic resources: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States.
