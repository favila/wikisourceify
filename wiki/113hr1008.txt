=={{anchor|H17D8A4134C3941BBA64F4006AD99A423}}Sec. 101. Reauthorization==

Sections 2 through 5 of the Special Olympics

=={{anchor|H23847200F93C48F08C3AD85AFA5F8AC3}}Sec. 2. Findings and
				purpose==



==={{anchor|H0444C813C5CC4851AF33E5278DF875CB}}(a) Findings– ===

[[w:United States Congress|Congress]]
				finds the following:
:(1) Special Olympics
				creates the possibilities of a world where everybody matters, everybody counts,
				and every person contributes.
:(2) The Government and
				the people of the United States recognize the dignity and value the giftedness
				of children and adults with intellectual disabilities.
:(3) The Government and the people of the United
				States recognize that children and adults with intellectual disabilities
				experience significant health disparities, including lack of access to primary
				care services and difficulties in accessing community-based prevention and
				treatment programs for chronic diseases.
:(4) The Government and the people of the United
				States are determined to end the isolation and stigmatization of people with
				intellectual disabilities, and to ensure that such people are assured of equal
				opportunities for community participation, access to appropriate health care,
				and inclusive education, and to experience life in a nondiscriminatory
				manner.
:(5) For more than 40
				years, Special Olympics has encouraged skill development, sharing, courage, and
				confidence through year-round sports training and athletic competition for
				children and adults with intellectual disabilities.
:(6) Special Olympics provides year-round sports
				training and competitive opportunities to more than 4,200,000 athletes with
				intellectual disabilities in 30 individual and team sports and plans to expand
				the benefits of participation through sport to more than a million additional
				people with intellectual disabilities within the United States and worldwide
				over the next 5 years.
:(7) Research shows that participation in
				activities involving both people with intellectual disabilities and people
				without disabilities results in more positive support for inclusion in society,
				including in schools.
:(8) Special Olympics has demonstrated its
				ability to provide a major positive effect on the quality of life of people
				with intellectual disabilities, improving their health and physical well-being,
				building their confidence and self-esteem, and giving them a voice to become
				active and productive members of their communities. In the United States, for
				example, adults with intellectual disabilities who have participated in Special
				Olympics have a 100 percent greater chance of being employed than adults with
				intellectual disabilities who have not.
:(9) In society as a
				whole, Special Olympics has become a vehicle and platform for reducing
				prejudice, improving public health, promoting inclusion efforts in schools and
				communities, and encouraging society to value the contributions of all
				members.
:(10) The Government of
				the United States enthusiastically supports the Special Olympics movement,
				recognizes its importance in improving the lives of people with intellectual
				disabilities and their families, and recognizes Special Olympics as a valued
				and important component of the global community.
