{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the right to counsel.    Whereas on March 18, 1963, the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]recognized in Gideon v. Wainwright that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases;   Whereas the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]held that providing counsel to indigent defendants in all felony cases meets the essential requirements of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and   Whereas the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]held in Argersinger v. Hamlin that absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless they were represented by counsel at their trial: Now, therefore, be it     That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]â€” 
:(1) supports the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the right to counsel; 
:(2) supports strategies to improve the criminal justice system to ensure that indigent defendants in all felony cases are adequately represented by counsel; and 
:(3) urges States to work to ensure that indigent defendants in all felony cases are adequately represented by counsel.     Karen L. Haas, Clerk.
