:(3) public confidence in the Federal chemical regulatory program has diminished over time;
:(4) scientific understanding of chemicals and the possible risks of the chemicals has evolved greatly since 1976, requiring that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] update the law to ensure that chemical regulation in the United States reflects modern science, technology and knowledge;
:(5) this Act should be modernized to create a robust Federal system for assessing and managing chemical risks;
:(6) chemicals are used in diverse manufacturing industries and other valuable commercial, institutional, and consumer applications that have benefitted society;
:(7) for the purposes of promoting uniform protections through regulation of chemical substances in commerce, to minimize undue burdens on commerce, and to minimize burdens on States, specified actions by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] should preempt requirements by States and political subdivisions of States that relate to the effects of or exposure to a chemical substance under the intended conditions of use; and
:(8) innovation in the development of new chemical substances, especially safer chemical substances, should be encouraged to reduce risk, provide improved products, stimulate the economy, create jobs, and protect interstate commerce.

===(b) Policy– ===

It is the policy of the United States that—
:(1) this Act—
::(A) should protect the health of people and the environment from the unmanaged risks of chemical substances; and

:(2) the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] —
::(A) should have the appropriate hazard, use, and exposure information necessary to make safety determinations;
::(B) should minimize the use of animal testing through the use of scientifically reliable and relevant test methods, where appropriate;
::(C) should encourage the use of best laboratory practices to ensure high quality, relevant, and reliable results from test methods and studies;
::(D) should have the authority to share confidential business information with States and political subdivisions of the States, subject to appropriate safeguards against inappropriate disclosure;
::(E) should have the resources and tools necessary to implement this Act; and
::(F) should implement this Act in a manner that promotes transparency of information and decisionmaking, protects substantiated confidential business information, and promotes innovation, including innovation in chemical substances that have reduced hazard, exposure, and risk patterns;
:(3) adequate data and information should be available with respect to the effect of and exposure to chemical substances and mixtures on health and the environment, to the extent necessary for safety assessments and determinations, and that, where necessary, the development of such test data and information should be the primary responsibility of those who manufacture or process such chemical substances and mixtures; and
:(4) States have an important role in protecting health and the environment from the unmanaged risks of chemical substances in commerce, particularly in recommending priorities for Federal assessment and regulation, providing safety assessment information, and fostering programs to protect consumers.

===(c) Intent of Congress– ===

It is the intent of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] shall—
:(1) rely on robust scientific evidence to implement this Act in a way that balances the mutual goals of promoting the safety of American consumers and preventing harm to American innovation, manufacturing, and the economy; and
:(2) implement this Act to protect the health of the people of the United States and the environment in such a manner as not to unduly impede commerce or create unnecessary economic barriers to technological innovation, including safer chemistry..
