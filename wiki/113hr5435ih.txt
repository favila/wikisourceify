{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for the coverage of home as a site of care for infusion therapy under the Medicare Program.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Medicare Home Infusion Site of Care Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The Medicare fee-for-service program covers infusion therapy in the hospital, skilled nursing facility, physician office, and hospital outpatient department, but does not cover the full range of services for the provision of infusion therapies in a patient’s home.
:(2) The Medicare program is presently the only major health care payer in the United States that does not provide comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy.
:(3) As a result of the Medicare program not providing for comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy, many Medicare beneficiaries are unable to obtain infusion therapy in the most cost-effective and convenient setting of their home, and physicians are deprived of the ability to select the best site of care for their patients.
:(4) The Medicare program is paying for institutional care for the provision of infusion therapy in many instances when such institutional care could be avoided if the Medicare program provided coverage for home infusion therapy.
:(5) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]found in a 2010 report that home infusion therapy is utilized widely by private payers providing health insurance coverage for individuals enrolled under such coverage and that such private payers generally are satisfied with the quality of care and the savings they achieve through avoided institutionalizations.
:(6) A recent study has reported a potential savings for Medicare if infusion therapies were covered in the home site of care.

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall determine a per diem schedule for payment for the professional services (including nursing services), supplies, and equipment described in section 1861(iii)(2)(A) for each infusion therapy type that reflects the reasonable costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated qualified home infusion therapy suppliers to provide such services, supplies, and equipment in conformity with applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, and the uniform quality and safety standards developed under section 1861(iii)(1) and to assure that Medicare beneficiaries have reasonable access to such therapy.

====(2) Considerations– ====

In developing the per diem schedule under this subsection, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall consider recent credible studies about the costs of providing infusion therapy in the home, consult with home infusion therapy suppliers, consider payment amounts established by Medicare Advantage plans and private payers for home infusion therapy, and, if necessary, conduct a statistically valid national market analysis involving the costs of administering infusion drugs and of providing professional services necessary for the drugs’ administration.

====(3) Annual updates– ====

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall update such schedule from year to year by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (United States city average) for the 12-month period ending with June of the preceding year. The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]may modify the per diem schedule with respect to beneficiaries who qualify for home infusion therapy services under section 1861(iii)(1) but who receive nursing services as home health services. .
