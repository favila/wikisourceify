{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating July 26, 2014, as“National Day of the American Cowboy”.    Whereas pioneering men and women, recognized as“cowboys”, helped to establish the American West;   Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, integrity, courage, compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and patriotism;   Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies strength of character, sound family values, and good common sense;   Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends ethnicity, gender, geographic boundaries, and political affiliations;   Whereas the cowboy, who lives off the land and works to protect and enhance the environment, is an excellent steward of the land and its creatures;   Whereas cowboy traditions have been a part of American culture for generations;   Whereas the cowboy continues to be an important part of the economy through the work of many thousands of ranchers across the United States who contribute to the economic well-being of every State;   Whereas millions of fans watch professional and working ranch rodeo events annually, making rodeo one of the most-watched sports in the United States;   Whereas membership and participation in rodeo and other organizations that promote and encompass the livelihood of cowboys span every generation and transcend race and gender;   Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in literature, film, and music and occupies a central place in the public imagination;   Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; and   Whereas the ongoing contributions made by cowboys and cowgirls to their communities should be recognized and encouraged: Now, therefore, be it
