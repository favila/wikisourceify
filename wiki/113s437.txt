:(3) there remains a large amount of severely distressed public and privately owned assisted housing concentrated in neighborhoods of extreme poverty; and
:(4) a broader approach is needed, using concentrated and coordinated neighborhood investment from multiple sources to transform neighborhoods of extreme poverty into communities that will improve the quality of life of current and future residents.
