[[w:Steve Israel|Mr. Israel]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To reauthorize the ban on undetectable firearms, and to extend the ban to undetectable firearm receivers and undetectable ammunition magazines.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Undetectable Firearms Modernization Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) according to data from the [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation]] , 8,583 of the 12,664 murders in the United States in 2011 were committed using a firearm, and more than 57 percent of the murders that occurred in New York State were perpetrated with a firearm;
:(2) the ability to produce a receiver for a firearm in the home would circumvent a number of laws, because the receiver is the component of the firearm that bears its serial number, as required by regulations;
:(3) digital manufacturing technologies, including but not limited to computer numerical control mills ( CNC mills ), 3-dimensional printers ( 3D printers ), and laser cutting machines, are quickly advancing to a point where it will soon be possible to fabricate fully operational firearm components; and
:(4) some commercially available products that utilize digital manufacturing technologies to manufacture objects are able to manufacture these objects using materials that are unable to be detected by traditional metal detectors, and may not present an accurate image on an x-ray.

=Sec. 3. Reauthorization of ban on undetectable firearms=

 Section 2(f)(2) of the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922 18 U.S.C. 922note] )is amended by striking “25” and inserting “35” .

=Sec. 4. Ban extended to undetectable firearm receivers made by individuals=

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922 Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code] , is amended—
:(1) in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922 paragraph (1)] —

<blockquote>
:::(A) any firearm—
::::(i) that, after removal of grips, stocks, and magazines, is not as detectable as the Security Exemplar, by walk-through metal detectors calibrated and operated to detect the Security Exemplar; or
::::(ii) any major component of which, when subjected to inspection by the types of x-ray machines commonly used at airports, does not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape of the component. Barium sulfate or other compounds may be used in the fabrication of the component; or
:::(B) any receiver for a rifle, or receiver for a handgun, manufactured by a person who is not a licensed manufacturer—
::::(i) that is not as detectable as the Receiver Security Exemplar for a rifle or for a handgun, as the case may be, by walk-through metal detectors calibrated and operated to detect that Receiver Security Exemplar; or
::::(ii) which, when subjected to inspection by the types of x-ray machines commonly used at airports, does not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape of the receiver. Barium sulfate or other compounds may be used in the fabrication of the receiver.;
</blockquote>

:(2) in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922 paragraph (2)] —
::(A) by striking “and” at the end of [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922 subparagraph (B)] ;

::::(i) constructed of, during the 12-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this subparagraph, 3.7 ounces of material type 17–4 PH stainless steel in a shape resembling the lower receiver for a rifle or for a handgun, as the case may be; and
::::(ii) suitable for testing and calibrating metal detectors:Provided, however, That at the close of such 12-month period, and at appropriate times thereafter the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall promulgate regulations to permit the manufacture, importation, sale, shipment, delivery, possession, transfer, or receipt of receivers for a rifle or receivers for a handgun, that were previously prohibited under this subparagraph that are as detectable as the Receiver Security Exemplar for a rifle or for a handgun, as the case may be, which contains 3.7 ounces of material type 17–4 PH stainless steel, in a shape resembling the lower receiver for a rifle or for a handgun, as the case may be, or such lesser amount as is detectable in view of advances in state-of-the-art developments in weapons detection technology.;
