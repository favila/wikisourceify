<blockquote>

===(b) Rule making considerations– ===

In a rule making, an agency shall make all preliminary and final factual determinations based on evidence and consider, in addition to other applicable considerations, the following:
:(1) The legal authority under which a rule may be proposed, including whether a rule making is required by statute, and if so, whether by a specific date, or whether the agency has discretion to commence a rule making.
:(2) Other statutory considerations applicable to whether the agency can or should propose a rule or undertake other agency action.
:(3) The specific nature and significance of the problem the agency may address with a rule (including the degree and nature of risks the problem poses and the priority of addressing those risks compared to other matters or activities within the agency’s jurisdiction), whether the problem warrants new agency action, and the countervailing risks that may be posed by alternatives for new agency action.
:(4) Whether existing rules have created or contributed to the problem the agency may address with a rule and whether those rules could be amended or rescinded to address the problem in whole or part.
:(5) Any reasonable alternatives for a new rule or other response identified by the agency or interested persons, including not only responses that mandate particular conduct or manners of compliance, but also—
::(A) the alternative of no Federal response;
::(B) amending or rescinding existing rules;
::(C) potential regional, State, local, or tribal regulatory action or other responses that could be taken in lieu of agency action; and
::(D) potential responses that—
:::(i) specify performance objectives rather than conduct or manners of compliance;
:::(ii) establish economic incentives to encourage desired behavior;
:::(iii) provide information upon which choices can be made by the public; or
:::(iv) incorporate other innovative alternatives rather than agency actions that specify conduct or manners of compliance.
:(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law—
::(A) the potential costs and benefits associated with potential alternative rules and other responses considered under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 section 553(b)(5)] , including direct, indirect, and cumulative costs and benefits and estimated impacts on jobs (including an estimate of the net gain or loss in domestic jobs), economic growth, innovation, and economic competitiveness;
::(B) means to increase the cost-effectiveness of any Federal response; and
::(C) incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability, lower costs of enforcement and compliance (to government entities, regulated entities, and the public), and flexibility.

===(c) Advance notice of proposed rule making for major rules, high-Impact rules, and rules involving novel legal or policy issues– ===

In the case of a rule making for a major rule or high-impact rule or a rule that involves a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates, not later than 90 days before a notice of proposed rule making is published in the Federal Register, an agency shall publish advance notice of proposed rule making in the Federal Register. In publishing such advance notice, the agency shall—

::(B) The agency may adopt a rule that is more costly than the least costly alternative that would achieve the relevant statutory objectives only if the additional benefits of the more costly rule justify its additional costs and only if the agency explains its reason for doing so based on interests of public health, safety or welfare that are clearly within the scope of the statutory provision authorizing the rule.
:(4) When it adopts a final rule, the agency shall publish a notice of final rule making. The notice shall include—
::(A) a concise, general statement of the rule’s basis and purpose;
::(B) the agency’s reasoned final determination of need for a rule to address the problem the agency seeks to address with the rule, including a statement of whether a rule is required by statute and a summary of any final risk assessment or regulatory impact analysis prepared by the agency;
::(C) the agency’s reasoned final determination that the benefits of the rule meet the relevant statutory objectives and justify the rule’s costs (including all costs to be considered under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subsection (b)(6)] );
::(D) the agency’s reasoned final determination not to adopt any of the alternatives to the proposed rule considered by the agency during the rule making, including—

:::(i) that existing rules have not created or contributed to the problem the agency seeks to address with the rule; or
:::(ii) that existing rules have created or contributed to the problem the agency seeks to address with the rule, and, if so—

::::(II) whether and how the agency intends to amend or rescind the existing rule separate from adoption of the rule;
::(F) the agency’s reasoned final determination that the evidence and other information upon which the agency bases the rule complies with the Information Quality Act; and

:::(ii) review of a rule under a plan required by [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (i)] of this subparagraph shall take into account the factors and criteria set forth in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subsections (b) through (f) of section 553 of this title] .All information considered by the agency in connection with its adoption of the rule, and, at the discretion of the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] or the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] , information provided by that Office in consultations with the agency, shall be placed in the docket for the rule and made accessible to the public for the public’s use no later than when the rule is adopted.

::(C)  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 Subparagraphs (B) through (H) of subsection (f)(4)] .

::(B) If, following compliance with [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (A) of this paragraph] , the agency adopts an interim rule, it shall commence proceedings that comply fully with [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subsections (d) through (f) of this section] immediately upon publication of the interim rule, shall treat the publication of the interim rule as publication of a notice of proposed rule making and shall not be required to issue supplemental notice other than to complete full compliance with [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subsection (d)] .
