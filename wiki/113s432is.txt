:(2) Trade and investment are powerful economic tools and can be used to reduce poverty and raise the standard of living in a country.
:(3) A country that is open to trade may increase its economic growth.
:(4) Trade and investment often lead to employment opportunities and often help alleviate poverty.
:(5) Least-developed countries have a particular challenge in meeting the economic requirements of and competitiveness necessary for globalization and international markets.
:(6) The United States has recognized the benefits that international trade provides to least-developed countries by enacting the Generalized System of Preferences under title V of the Trade Act of 1974( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/2461 19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.] )and trade benefits for developing countries in the Caribbean, Andean, and sub-Saharan African regions of the world.
:(7) Enhanced trade with least-developed Muslim countries, including Afghanistan and Bangladesh, is consistent with other United States objectives of encouraging a strong private sector and individual economic empowerment in those countries.
:(8) Offering least-developed countries enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of positive economic and political developments throughout the world.
:(9) Encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers will enhance the benefits of trade and investment as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and the countries designated for benefits under this Act.
:(10) Economic opportunity and engagement in the global trading system together with support for democratic institutions and a respect for human rights are mutually reinforcing objectives and key elements of a policy to confront and defeat global terrorism.
