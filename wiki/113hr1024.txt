===={{anchor|H2ABA61DEDA5A4F4FA3963164875D8311}}(I) Initial determinations– ====

With regard to any single chronic disease, clause (ii)(I)(bb)shall only be applied if the [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]] determines that the application of such clause with regard to such disease is not projected to increase overall costs to the Medicare program under this title over the five year period beginning on the date of determination.

===={{anchor|HBA468FFF7FA944C4A07069224E1A6BFF}}(II) Review of determinations– ====

In the case that clause (ii)(I)(bb)is applied with respect to a single chronic disease pursuant to a determination under subclause (I), not later than five years after such date of determination, the [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]] shall review the effect of the application of such clause with respect to such disease on the actual cost of the Medicare program under this title during such five years. Based on such review, if the [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Chief Actuary]] is unable to determine that, with regard to such single chronic disease, the application of such clause did not increase costs to the Federal government under the Medicare program under this title over such period, then the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] shall review the findings of the [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Chief Actuary]] and determine whether such clause shall continue to be applied with regard to such single chronic disease. In conducting such review and making such determination, the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] shall consider the extent to which the application of such clause with regard to such single chronic disease effects the health outcomes of part D eligible individuals and any savings and costs to the Federal government under the Medicare program under this title..
