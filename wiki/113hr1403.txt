To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe rules regulating inmate telephone service rates.

={{anchor|HC51EC4AEF5284A339923D2E92D3B2220}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Family Telephone Connection Protection Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|HA57E0AAA4419467B8DF695ED124876B8}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that:
:(1) It is the policy of the United States to ensure that all Americans are afforded just and reasonable communications services, including those families that pay rates for inmate telephone service.
:(2) The telephone is the primary method by which individuals correspond and maintain contact with family members who are incarcerated in correctional institutions.
:(3) Except for emergency purposes, family members are not allowed to call people incarcerated in correctional institutions; incarcerated persons are typically allowed to call family members and other pre-approved individuals only through payphones physically located on the premises of correctional institutions.
:(4) Inmate telephone service in correctional institutions often is limited to collect calling.
:(5) Regardless of whether the prisoners’ calls are placed collect or through a debit account, the prisoners’ family members typically pay for the calls, either through their telephone bills, in the case of collect calls received from prisoners, or by making deposits directly into prisoners’ debit accounts.
:(6) It is clear from various studies that maintaining frequent and meaningful communications between people who are incarcerated and family members is key to the successful social reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals. Such contact reduces recidivism and facilitates rehabilitation, which in turn reduces crime and the future costs of imprisonment.
:(7) Frequent communications between incarcerated persons and family members is burdened, and in some cases, prevented, by excessive inmate telephone service rates. Excessive inmate telephone service rates thus weaken the family and community ties that are necessary for successful reentry into society by persons who were formerly incarcerated and the reduction in crime resulting from successful reentry.
:(8) Innocent citizens are paying excessive telephone charges simply due to having a family member or loved one who is incarcerated.
:(9) The rates for calls from correctional institutions are some of the highest rates in the United States, with some per-minute charges reaching $1 and service or connection charges of $3.00 per call.
:(10) Information compiled by the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] shows that the high rates are due in part to the lack of competition between telephone companies that provide long distance inmate telephone service to correctional institutions.
:(11) There are no competitive forces providing incentives for those carriers to lower prices or operate efficiently because, unlike the mass market, only one carrier is typically permitted to provide long distance inmate telephone service within each correctional institution.
:(12) High calling rates also are due in part to commissions that carriers pay to correctional institution administrators for the exclusive right to provide long distance inmate telephone service in a correctional facility. In some cases, such commissions can account for as much as 60 percent of the total revenues received from the use of prison payphones.
:(13) The collection of such commissions by correctional institution administrators and State departments of correction based upon interstate telecommunications revenues is a burden on interstate commerce.
:(14) Due to the lack of competition for telephone services within correctional institutions, families of people in prison, many of whom have low incomes, cannot choose the long distance carrier with the lowest calling rates and must pay the excessive rates charged by the carrier having the exclusive right to provide long distance service to the correctional institution from which the call originates.
:(15) The [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] has the expertise and authority to regulate inmate telephone service. Because parties to [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] rulemaking proceedings have raised issues regarding its authority to implement meaningful relief for excessive inmate telephone service rates, Congress finds it necessary and appropriate to reaffirm that the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] has the authority to implement the types of relief set forth in this Act.
