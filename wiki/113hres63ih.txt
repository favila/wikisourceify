{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of the first Saturday in October as“National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s Day”to create awareness, educate humans of the importance of adoption, and create a humane environment for any pet, including the importance of spaying and neutering of animals, and the encouragement of animal adoptions throughout the United States.    Whereas between 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 cats and dogs are placed into shelters every year and between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 are euthanized;   Whereas the United States has suffered a drastic economic crisis that has left animals behind in abandoned homes to die or left on the doorsteps of overpopulated shelters and rescues;   Whereas a greater awareness of dog fighting and abuse encourages these animals to be put to sleep or left for shelters or rescues to rehabilitate them;   Whereas there are between 4,000 to 6,000 animal shelters throughout the United States in need of pet supplies, medical supplies, blankets and towels, cleaning supplies, food, and educational materials about owning a pet, as well as information on how to screen unqualified applicants and provide the best pet match for a family;   Whereas increased knowledge and awareness of animal rescue programs throughout the United States will significantly reduce the number of cats and dogs euthanized and reduce the number of animals returned to a shelter who have been rescued;   Whereas a“National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s Day”will reduce the problem of pet overpopulation, provide animals with good homes, and create awareness as well as financial and educational resources for the problems animal shelters face each day;   Whereas a“National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s Day”would encourage homes for harmless animals like Winslow, a Basset Hound who spent his first 8 months of life starved and confined in a cage so small that his rear legs were unable to fully develop and then was placed in multiple shelters before being adopted into a loving home; and   Whereas the first Saturday in October would be an appropriate day to designate as “National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s Day” and celebrate it through events, festivals, or Pawtograph signings which will increase revenues for shelters and pet adoptions: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]supports the designation of a “National Animal Rescue Day/Winslow’s Day” to create awareness for animal rescue programs throughout the year and address the challenge of overpopulation through continued spaying and neutering.
