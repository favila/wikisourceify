=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that in order for a comprehensive and effective literacy program to address the needs of children it is critical to address the following:
:(1) Literacy development is an ongoing process that requires a sustained engagement and investment beginning in early childhood and continuing through secondary school.
:(2) Developing literacy skills begins at birth as infants and toddlers associate sounds, gestures, and marks on paper with consequences and meaning. Many teachers and staff in early learning programs are not provided with high-quality professional development in how to support children’s language and literacy development. Such high-quality professional learning and preparation, that is job-embedded and ongoing, promotes strong early language and literacy for all children’s readiness for school.
:(3) Research shows that writing leads to improved reading achievement, reading leads to better writing performance, and combined instruction leads to improvements in both areas. Students in kindergarten through grade 12 need to be engaged in combined reading and writing experiences that lead to a higher level of thinking than when either process is taught alone.
:(4) Teachers and early childhood educators need professional development to improve the reading and writing abilities of children who are at risk for developmental delays or are reading and writing several years below grade level. Middle school and secondary school teachers in core academic subjects must have the tools and skills to teach reading and writing for subject area understanding and to differentiate and provide instruction for students with varying literacy skills.
:(5) Approximately 70 percent of 4th graders and 8th graders read below the proficient level on the 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress.
:(6) Between 1971 and 2008, the reading levels of 17-year-olds in the United States showed little to no improvement. The ability of secondary school students to read complex texts is strongly predictive of their performance in postsecondary mathematics and science courses.
:(7) Only one-third of secondary school students who enter 9th grade each year can expect to graduate in 4 years with the skills needed to succeed in higher education and the workplace.
:(8) The 25 fastest growing professions have higher than average literacy demands while the fastest declining professions have lower than average literacy demands.
:(9) The intellectual and linguistic skills necessary for reading and writing must be developed through explicit, intentional, and systematic language activities, to which many low-income and minority students do not have access.
:(10) Only 71 percent of secondary school students graduate on time with a diploma, meaning that every year 1,230,000 students fail to graduate from secondary school in the United States. These 1,230,000 nongraduates cost the United States more than $319,000,000,000 in lost wages, taxes, and productivity over their lifetimes.
:(11) Meaningful engagement of families in their children’s early learning supports school readiness and later academic success. Parental literacy habits are positively associated with parental reading beliefs, parent-child literacy and language activities in the home, children’s print knowledge, and interest in reading and writing.

=Sec. 3. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to improve reading, writing, and academic achievement for children and students by providing Federal support to State educational agencies, in collaboration with State agencies that oversee child care programs, to develop, coordinate, and implement comprehensive State literacy plans that ensure high-quality instruction and effective practices in early language and literacy in early learning programs (serving children from birth through kindergarten entry) and in reading and writing in kindergarten through grade 12; and
:(2) to assist State educational agencies and State agencies that oversee child care and other early childhood programs in achieving the purposes described in paragraph (1)by—
::(A) supporting the development and implementation of early learning through grade 12 literacy programs that are based on scientifically valid research, to ensure that every student can read and write at grade level or above;
::(B) providing children attending early learning programs that serve children from birth through kindergarten entry, including programs, such as child care, Early Head Start, Head Start, State-funded preschool, public library programs, and other early childhood education settings, with high-quality, language-rich, literature-rich, informational text-rich, culturally relevant, developmentally appropriate environments, so that such children develop the fundamental knowledge and skills necessary for literacy engagement, development, and achievement in kindergarten and beyond;
::(C) educating parents in the ways they can support their child’s communication and literacy development;
::(D) supporting efforts to link and align standards and evidence-based teaching practices and instruction in early learning programs serving children from birth through kindergarten entry;
::(E) supporting high-quality, effective educational and development environments for children and students from birth through grade 12 to develop oral language, reading comprehension, and writing abilities through evidence-based instruction and practices;
::(F) improving student achievement by establishing literacy initiatives that provide explicit and systematic instruction in oral language, reading, and writing development across the curriculum;
::(G) identifying and supporting students who are reading and writing below grade level by providing evidence-based intensive interventions, including extended learning time, to help such students acquire the language and literacy skills they need to graduate from secondary school;
::(H) providing assistance to eligible entities in order to provide educators with high-quality professional development in the essential components of early literacy instruction and the essential components of reading and writing instruction;
::(I) supporting State educational agencies and local educational agencies in using age- and developmentally appropriate instructional materials and strategies, including those consistent with universal design for learning, that assist teachers as they work with students to develop reading and writing competencies appropriate to the student’s grade and skill levels;
::(J) supporting State educational agencies and eligible entities in improving reading, writing, and academic achievement for children and students, especially those that are low-income, limited English proficient, migratory, Indian or Alaskan Native, neglected or delinquent, homeless, in the custody of the child welfare system, those that have disabilities, or those who have dropped out of school; and
::(K) strengthening coordination among schools, early learning programs, early literacy programs, family literacy programs, juvenile justice programs, public libraries, and outside-of-school programs that provide children and youth with strategies, curricula, interventions, and assessments designed to advance early and continuing language and literacy development in ways appropriate for each context.
