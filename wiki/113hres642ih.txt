{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the three kidnapped teenagers held captive in the West Bank, and for other purposes.    Whereas on June 12, 2014, three Israeli teenagers, Eyal Yifrach, Gil-ad Sha'er, and Naftali Frankel, disappeared returning home from school in Gush Etzion;   Whereas Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the teenagers were“kidnapped by a terrorist organization”;   Whereas Naftali Frankel holds United States citizenship;   Whereas the Israeli security services have prevented dozens of kidnapping attempts, and Israeli officials have said that abductors’ goals have been to trade hostages for Palestinian prisoners;   Whereas the [[w:United States Department of State|United States Department of State]]immediately condemned the kidnapping of the three teenagers, urged cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian security services, acknowledged that“many indications point to Hamas’ involvement”and reiterated that“Hamas is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past.”;   Whereas Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the kidnapped boys“are human beings and we are looking for them and we will hold their kidnappers accountable whoever they are”, referring to the kidnapping;   Whereas Khalid Meshaal, head of Hamas, was quoted as saying that he“blesses the hands of those who kidnapped”, and“if there is a confirmation that a Palestinian group is behind the kidnapping, we should applaud and take off our hats to them”;   Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross has called for the immediate and unconditional release of the three teenagers;   Whereas continual security cooperation between the Palestinian Authority security forces and Israel is essential to preventing future violence and incidents of kidnapping;   Whereas the Palestinian Authority recently announced a reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Fatah, paving the way for a unity government supported by Hamas; and   Whereas  Section 7040 of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2014 ([[Public Law 113-76|division K ofPublic Law 113–76)]]  states that no United States assistance is permitted for a“power-sharing PA government that includes Hamas as a member”, or that results from an agreement with Hamas and over which Hamas exercises“undue influence”, unless the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]certifies that the Palestinian Authority government, including all ministers, has recognized Israel's right to exist and accepted previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements: Now, therefore, be it
