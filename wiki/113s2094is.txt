=Sec. 2. Findings; purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) Beginning with enactment of the  Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships in 1980 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/1901 22 U.S.C. 1901 et seq].), the [[w:United States Coast Guard|United States Coast Guard]]has been the principal Federal authority charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation.
:(2) The [[w:United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]estimates there are approximately 21,560,000 State-registered recreational vessels, 75,000 commercial fishing vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank barges operating in United States waters.
:(3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel were exempted by regulation from otherwise applicable permitting requirements.

::(E)    title XIV of division B of Appendix D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763), which prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges in certain areas of Alaska;
::(F)    section 204 of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1902a 33 U.S.C. 1902a] ), which established requirements for the regulation of vessel discharges of agricultural cargo residue material in the form of hold washings; and
::(G)    title X of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/3801 33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq].), which provided for the implementation of the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001.
