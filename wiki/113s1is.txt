={{anchor|idC76DF2434BD44E8591B211682A6F28F2}}Sec. 2. Sense of the Senate=

It is the sense of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] should—
:(1) create a roadmap for immigrants who are here without legal status to earn citizenship, provided they pay taxes, complete a background check, learn English, and show a commitment to America;
:(2) allow students who came to America as children to earn citizenship by attending college or joining the Armed Forces;
:(3) protect the sustainability of the American agricultural industry, including the dairy industry, with a stable and legal agricultural workforce;
:(4) encourage those who seek to invest in the United States and create American jobs;
:(5) permit and encourage individuals who earn an advanced degree from one of our world-class universities to remain in the United States, rather than using that education to work for our international competitors;
:(6) fulfill and strengthen our Nation's commitments regarding security along our borders and at our ports of entry;
:(7) strengthen our Nation’s historic humanitarian tradition of welcoming asylum seekers and refugees and improve existing policies that support immigrant victims of crime and domestic violence;
:(8) create an effective electronic verification system and strengthen enforcement to prevent employers from hiring people here illegally;
:(9) implement a rational legal immigration system that promotes job creation by converting the current flow of illegal immigrants into the United States into a more manageable, controlled, and legal process for admitting immigrants while, at the same time, safeguarding the jobs, rights, and wages of American workers; and
:(10) adopt practical and fair immigration reforms to help ensure that all families are able to be together.
