{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Celebrating the 200th August Quarterly Festival taking place from August 18, 2013, through August 25, 2013, in Wilmington, Delaware.    Whereas, 200 years before the date of agreement to this resolution, in 1813, Peter Spencer founded the African Union Church, 1 of the first African-American institutions legally incorporated within the United States;   Whereas, 1 year later, in 1814, Spencer and the African Union Church convened the first August Quarterly meeting and festival in Wilmington, Delaware, bringing thousands of African-Americans together to celebrate their faith;   Whereas the August Quarterly (or Big Quarterly ) Festival became a meeting place for African-Americans celebrating freedom, sharing in solidarity, and looking for relatives lost or sold in the institution of slavery, and a means through which Harriett Tubman and other conductors and station masters of the Underground Railroad met with those looking to escape the bonds of slavery;   Whereas the August Quarterly Festival is well recognized as the longest continuously celebrated African-American festival in the United States; and   Whereas, from August 18, 2013, through August 25, 2013, thousands of people will come together in Wilmington, Delaware, to celebrate the 200th August Quarterly Festival: Now, therefore, be it
