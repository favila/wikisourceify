=Sec. 2. Findings and Purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) The Federal Government sends hundreds of billions of dollars to the States each and every year.
:(2) In fiscal year 2010, among the money sent to the States were $348 billion for health and human services, $64 billion for transportation, $55 billion for housing and urban development, $73 billion for education, and $33 billion for agriculture.
:(3) States receive money from the Federal Government through grants, loans, loan guarantees, property, cooperative agreements, interest subsidies, insurance, food commodities, and direct appropriations, among others means.
:(4) Every State spends money for common activities such as health care, transportation, housing, education, agriculture and other issues, yet some States are more effective than others when spending these Federal taxpayer dollars.
:(5) Taxpayers, legislators, and agencies should be able to objectively and reliably share data comparing apples-to-apples performance measurements that identify what government does and what it really costs.
:(6) Activity-based total accountability will show which States are the most effective with taxpayer dollars and lead to competition among States.
:(7) States demonstrating that they are more efficient with tax dollars by having lower activity costs will serve as models for others to ensure that there is more accountability for how tax dollars are spent and to ensure that the taxpayer is getting the best value for their dollar.
