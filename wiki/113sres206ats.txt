{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Designating September 2013 as “National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month” .Whereas 2,500,000 families in the United States live with prostate cancer;Whereas 1 in 6 males in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes;Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths among males in the United States;Whereas the National Cancer Institute estimates that, in 2013, nearly 240,000 men will be diagnosed with, and more than 29,000 men will die of, prostate cancer;Whereas 40 percent of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases occur in males under the age of 65;Whereas approximately every 14 seconds, a male in the United States turns 50 years old and increases his odds of developing cancer, including prostate cancer;Whereas African-American males suffer from a prostate cancer incidence rate that is up to 65 percent higher than that for white males and have double the prostate cancer mortality rate than that of white males;Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity of prostate cancer;Whereas the probability that obesity will lead to death and high cholesterol levels is strongly associated with advanced prostate cancer;Whereas males in the United States with 1 family member diagnosed with prostate cancer have a 33 percent chance of being diagnosed with the disease, males with 2 close family members diagnosed have an 83 percent chance, and males with 3 family members diagnosed have a 97 percent chance;Whereas only 33 percent of males survive more than 5 years if diagnosed with prostate cancer after the cancer has metastasized;Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms of prostate cancer while in the early stages, making screening critical;Whereas screening by a digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen blood test can detect the disease in the early stages, increasing the chances of survival for more than 5 years to nearly 100 percent;Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment; andWhereas educating people in the United States, including health care providers, about prostate cancer and early detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of males and preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it
