{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commemorating the relaunching of the 172-year-old Charles W. Morgan by Mystic Seaport: The Museum of America and the Sea.    Whereas the Charles W. Morgan (referred to in this preamble as the Morgan ) was built and launched from New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1841;   Whereas the Morgan is a National Historic Landmark vessel, the only remaining wooden whaleship in the world, and the oldest commercial vessel in the United States;   Whereas the Morgan and similar vessels were the economic backbone of New England for 200 years;   Whereas the Morgan has served as a living artifact and a testament to the ingenuity, risk, and entrepreneurship of the United States since the vessel retired from the whaling industry in 1921;   Whereas the Morgan has completed a 5-year, multi-million dollar restoration at the Preservation Shipyard of Mystic Seaport: The Museum of America and the Sea and will be relaunched on July 21, 2013;   Whereas the Morgan will embark on a ceremonial 38th voyage in June 2014, serving as Ambassador to the world’s whales and to the world’s whaling heritage;   Whereas the 38th voyage of the Morgan will rekindle the spirit of exploration and discovery of people throughout the world;   Whereas individuals and organizations from 22 States have contributed materials and expertise to the restoration and 38th voyage of the Morgan; and   Whereas the new mission of the Morgan will be devoted to history, education, science, and ocean awareness: Now, therefore, be it
