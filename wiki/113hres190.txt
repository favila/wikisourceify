{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Condemning the April 15, 2013, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks in Boston, Massachusetts and calling upon the United States Government, the governments of all nations, the United Nations, and other international organizations to renounce the use of IEDs and take actions to stop their proliferation.Whereas on April 15, 2013, innocent civilians were maliciously victimized by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in a terrorist attack in Boston, Massachusetts;Whereas the IED has become a very effective weapon for those who advance their cause through terror and violence, as exemplified by the fact that an average of 500 IED incidents occur in the world each day, excluding incidents occurring in Iraq or Afghanistan, and that an average of 12 such incidents occur each day in both Iraq and Afghanistan;Whereas IED attacks are the leading cause of casualties for American servicemembers and are anticipated to remain the leading cause of such casualties for the foreseeable future;Whereas the Global Campaign Against IEDs, as a responsible international entity for action against IEDs and for supporting IED victims, has found that IED attacks are the leading cause of the most prevalent injuries to veterans, including vision and hearing loss, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injury, amputations, genitourinary injuries, and post-traumatic stress disorder;Whereas the Blinded Veterans Association and AMVETS have found that the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] currently treats 198,670 veterans for hearing injuries and 118,150 veterans for eye injuries, numbers that are expected to increase significantly as active duty servicemembers enter the Veterans Affairs system;Whereas people who live in areas affected by IED incidents live in constant fear of additional attacks that disrupt everything from daily routines to health care to elections, and these disruptions, together with the displacement, destruction, and loss of personal assets caused by IED incidents, severely degrade the ability of these people to sustain their livelihoods;Whereas reducing the use of IEDs and neutralizing the networks that produce them requires a holistic approach to identify and eliminate the root causes that allow such networks to form and survive;Whereas IEDs kill scores of innocent civilians, including women and children; andWhereas resolving the IED problem is the global community’s responsibility: Now, therefore, be it
