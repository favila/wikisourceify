={{anchor|HBABD4329A7AA4909BD50FC9BE2DEBBCE}}Sec. 8. Sense of Congress regarding rural America=



=={{anchor|HD856A0DC80484A57B3F17E9FD2F82AE7}}(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The founders realized the fundamental importance of property rights when they codified the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that private property shall not be taken“for public use, without just compensation”.
:(2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating properties for State and local governments. In addition, farmland and forest land owners need to have long-term certainty regarding their property rights in order to make the investment decisions to commit land to these uses.
:(3) Ownership rights in rural land are fundamental building blocks for our Nation’s agriculture industry, which continues to be one of the most important economic sectors of our economy.
:(4) In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Kelo v. City of New London, abuse of eminent domain is a threat to the property rights of all private property owners, including rural land owners.

=={{anchor|H126C28AB635B4C329D345E0BA081AC99}}(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that the use of eminent domain for the purpose of economic development is a threat to agricultural and other property in rural America and that the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] should protect the property rights of Americans, including those who reside in rural areas. Property rights are central to liberty in this country and to our economy. The use of eminent domain to take farmland and other rural property for economic development threatens liberty, rural economies, and the economy of the United States. The taking of farmland and rural property will have a direct impact on existing irrigation and reclamation projects. Furthermore, the use of eminent domain to take rural private property for private commercial uses will force increasing numbers of activities from private property onto this Nation’s public lands, including its National forests, National parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can overburden the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the enjoyment of such lands for all citizens. Americans should not have to fear the government’s taking their homes, farms, or businesses to give to other persons. Governments should not abuse the power of eminent domain to force rural property owners from their land in order to develop rural land into industrial and commercial property. [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has a duty to protect the property rights of rural Americans in the face of eminent domain abuse.

={{anchor|H09977AFF122648F0A38CFFED372B22EF}}Sec. 9. Sense of Congress=

It is the policy of the United States to encourage, support, and promote the private ownership of property and to ensure that the constitutional and other legal rights of private property owners are protected by the Federal Government.

=={{anchor|HEED9BFEC52F24C8E90814D79882AA110}}(b) Ineligibility for Federal Funds– ==
