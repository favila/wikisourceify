:(3) The residents of the Arctic region of the United States are under-served in freight transportation, and deep-draft ports in the Arctic will enhance economic opportunities and quality of life for such residents.
:(4) Arctic communities rely on subsistence hunting for economic and cultural survival, and it is critical to protect the Arctic environment and maintain subsistence resources.
