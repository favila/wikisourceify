{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commemorating and honoring the dedication and sacrifice of the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have been killed or injured in the line of duty.    Whereas the well-being of all individuals in the United States is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance and dedication of law enforcement officers;   Whereas more than 900,000 law enforcement officers greatly risk their personal safety to serve individuals in the United States as guardians of the peace;   Whereas law enforcement officers are often on the front lines in protecting the schools and school children in the United States;   Whereas, in 2013, 101 law enforcement officers across the United States were killed in the line of duty;   Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]should strongly support initiatives to reduce violent crime and contribute to the safety of law enforcement officers, including— 
:(1) providing such officers with equipment of the highest quality and modernity; 
:(2) increasing the availability and use of bullet-resistant vests for such officers; 
:(3) improving training for such officers; and 
:(4) providing advanced emergency medical care for such officers;   Whereas more than 19,000 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers lost their lives in the line of duty while protecting citizens of the United States, and the names of such officers are engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC;   Whereas, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as“National Peace Officers Memorial Day”; and   Whereas, on May 15, 2014, more than 20,000 law enforcement officers are expected to gather in Washington, DC, to join the families of their fallen comrades to honor those comrades and all law enforcement officers who have fallen before them: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]—
:(1) commemorates and acknowledges the dedication and sacrifices of the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have been killed or injured in the line of duty;
:(2) recognizes May 15, 2014, as“National Peace Officers Memorial Day”; and
:(3) calls on the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies, solemnity, appreciation, and respect.
