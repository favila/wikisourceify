=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Our Nation's highways, transit systems, railroads, ports, and inland waterways drive our economy, enabling all industries to achieve growth and productivity that makes America strong and prosperous.
:(2) The establishment, maintenance, and improvement of the national transportation network is a national priority, for economic, environmental, energy, security, and other reasons.
:(3) The ability to move people and goods is critical to maintaining State, metropolitan, rural, and local economies.
:(4) The construction of infrastructure requires combining skills from numerous occupations, including those in the contracting, engineering, planning and design, materials supply, manufacturing, distribution, and safety industries.
:(5) Investing in transportation infrastructure creates long-term capital assets for the Nation that will help the United States address its enormous infrastructure needs and improve its economic productivity.
:(6) Investment in transportation infrastructure creates jobs and spurs economic activity to put people back to work and stimulate the economy.
:(7) Every billion dollars in transportation investment has the potential to create up to 30,000 jobs.
:(8) Every dollar invested in the Nation's transportation infrastructure yields at least $5.70 in economic benefits because of reduced delays, improved safety, and reduced vehicle operating costs.
:(9) Numerous experts have noted that the estimated cost to maintain and improve our Nation's highways, bridges, and other critical transportation infrastructure significantly exceeds what is currently being provided by all levels of government.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to provide financing for additional transportation infrastructure capital investments.
