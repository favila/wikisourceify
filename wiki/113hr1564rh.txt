In addition, the update shall include a study of—
:(1) whether mandatory rotation of registered public accounting firms would mitigate against potential conflicts of interest between public accounting firms and issuers;
:(2) whether mandatory rotation of registered public accounting firms would impair audit quality due to the loss of loss of industry or company-specific knowledge gained by a public accounting firm through years of experience auditing the issuer; and
:(3) what affect the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has had on registered public accounting firms’ independence and whether additional independence reforms are needed.

==(b) Report Required– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] shall submit a report to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate]] and the [[w:United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives]] on the results of the study and review required by this section.

==(c) Definition– ==

For purposes of this section, the term“mandatory rotation”refers to the imposition of a limit on the period of years in which a particular registered public accounting firm may be the auditor of record for a particular issuer.
