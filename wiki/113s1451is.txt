:(5) the water clarity of Lake Tahoe declined from a visibility level of 105 feet in 1967 to only 70 feet in 2008;
:(6) the rate of decline in water clarity of Lake Tahoe has decreased in recent years;
:(7) a stable water clarity level for Lake Tahoe could be achieved through feasible control measures for very fine sediment particles and nutrients;
:(8) fine sediments that cloud Lake Tahoe, and key nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen that support the growth of algae and invasive plants, continue to flow into the lake from stormwater runoff from developed areas, roads, turf, other disturbed land, and streams;
:(9) the destruction and alteration of wetland, wet meadows, and stream zone habitat have compromised the natural capacity of the watershed to filter sediment, nutrients, and pollutants before reaching Lake Tahoe;
:(10) approximately 25 percent of the trees in the Lake Tahoe Basin are either dead or dying;
:(11) forests in the Tahoe Basin suffer from over a century of fire suppression and periodic drought, which have resulted in—
