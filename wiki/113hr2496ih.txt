{{Center|A BILL}}

To prohibit the deployment of United States Armed Forces in support of a United Nations or mutual security treaty military operation absent express prior statutory authorization from Congress for such deployment, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Article I, section 8 of the Constitution vests solely in [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] the power to declare war.
:(2) The Constitution does not permit the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] through the treaty process to transfer article I congressional authority to international and regional organizations.
:(3) From 1789 to 1950, all offensive wars were either declared or authorized by Congress. From 1950 forward, presidents have circumvented [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the Constitution by claiming to receive authority from the United Nations Security Council and from such mutual security treaties as the North Atlantic Treaty.
:(4) The Charter of the United Nations requires each member nation to determine its constitutional processes for reaching a special agreement that contributes troops and equipment to a United Nations military operation. [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] defined United States constitutional processes by enacting the United Nations Participation Act of 1945. Section 6 of such Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// 22 U.S.C. 287d] )provides: “The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] is authorized to negotiate a special agreement or agreements with the Security Council which shall be subject to the approval of the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] by appropriate Act or joint resolution … .” .
:(5)  Section 8(a)(2) of the War Powers Resolution( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1547 50 U.S.C. 1547(a)(2)] ] )specifically states that the authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities shall not be inferred “from any treaty heretofore or hereafter ratified unless such treaty is implemented by legislation specifically authorizing the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into such situations and stating that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of this joint resolution” .
:(6) An authorization by the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] or any other international or regional body for the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities is not a constitutional substitute for a congressional declaration of war or authorization for the use of force.

=Sec. 2. Statement of policy=

It is the policy of the United States that—
:(1) the constitutional authority of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the system of self-government and popular control established by the Framers of the Constitution shall be protected; and
:(2) any vote of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]] or any party to a mutual security treaty (including NATO and others) shall only be advisory and does not constitute authority to deploy United States Armed Forces.

=Sec. 3. Prohibitions on deployment of United States Armed Forces=



==(a) General prohibition– ==

No unit or individual of the United States Armed Forces may be deployed in support of a [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] or a mutual security treaty military operation absent express prior statutory authorization from [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] for such deployment.

==(b) Funding prohibition– ==

No funds appropriated or otherwise made available to any executive agency of the United States Government may be used to carry out any United Nations or mutual security treaty military operation unless the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] seeks and obtains express prior authorization by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , as required under article I, section 8 of the Constitution.
