{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that sedentary lifestyles are a public health issue and supporting the designation of a National Get Vertical Day to recognize the importance of preventing physical inactivity and encouraging adults to live physically active lifestyles.    Whereas the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the last 25 years;   Whereas over one-third of adults in the United States are obese, and ethnic and racial minorities face disproportionately high obesity and diabetes rates;   Whereas over 27 percent of all Americans 17 to 24 years of age (over 9,000,000 young men and women) are too heavy to join the military;   Whereas only 22 percent of Americans report regular, sustained physical activity and only 5 percent of adults achieve the recommended 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity;   Whereas sedentary lifestyles burden our economy and health care system, costing up to $24,000,000,000 in direct medical spending;   Whereas sedentary lifestyles increase the likelihood of chronic diseases, including diabetes, which accounts for more than $98,000,000,000 in direct and indirect medical costs and lost productivity each year;   Whereas it is estimated that physical inactivity is responsible for 1 in 10 deaths each year;   Whereas many chronic diseases stemming from physical inactivity, including diabetes, are preventable and controllable through a number of modest lifestyle changes, including standing up or employing alternative physical movement for 5 minutes every hour in the workplace;   Whereas the relevance of obesity and physical inactivity is much higher in people with disabilities than people without disabilities;   Whereas walking 10,000 steps a day leads to a 90-percent reduction in heart attacks, a 30- to 70-percent reduction in cancer rates, a 50-percent reduction in type 2 diabetes, and a 70-percent reduction in the rate of strokes; and   Whereas the short- and long-term costs of reduced productivity, health care expenses, and negative health outcomes create the imperative for increased physical movement in the workplace: Now, therefore, be it
