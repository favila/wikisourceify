{{Center|A BILL}}

 To prevent undue disruption of interstate commerce by limiting civil actions brought against persons whose only role with regard to a product in the stream of commerce is as a lawful seller of the product.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Innocent Sellers Fairness Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) an innocent seller should not be held responsible under the doctrine of product liability for damages that the seller did not cause;
:(2) as a result of product liability, sellers are often brought into litigation despite the fact that they had no control or input in the design, production, or any other aspect of an allegedly defective product, and may therefore face increased costs due to the possibility or result of disproportionate damage awards;
:(3) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation costs, sellers face higher costs in purchasing insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their activities;
:(4) liability reform for sellers will promote the free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate commerce, decrease litigiousness, and lower prices to consumers; and
:(5) legislation to address these concerns is an appropriate exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses 3, 9, and 18 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States, and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 

=Sec. 3. Limitation on liability of product sellers=

:(3) The seller participated in the installation of the product.
:(4) The seller altered, modified, or expressly warranted the product in a manner not authorized by the manufacturer.
:(5) The seller had actual knowledge of the defect in the product as a result of a recall from the manufacturer or governmental entity authorized to make such recall or actual inspection at the time the seller sold the product to the claimant.
:(6) The seller had actual knowledge of the defect in the product at the time the seller supplied the product.
