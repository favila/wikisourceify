{{Center|A BILL}}

To direct the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in coordination with the Army Corps of Engineers, the National Park Service, and the United States Geological Survey, to lead a multiagency effort to slow the spread of Asian Carp in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Strategic Response to Asian Carp Invasion Act”.

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:
: The rapid spread of several invasive species of Asian Carp in the Upper Mississippi River and Ohio River basins and tributaries threatens ecosystems and billions of dollars of economic activities connected to outdoor recreation in States throughout the Midwest.: While Federal efforts have focused on preventing the spread of Asian Carp into the Great Lakes, there is growing recognition of the threat these invasive species pose to other ecosystems in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins.
3. Multiagency effort to slow the spread of Asian Carp in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries


The [[Wikipedia:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ]], in coordination with the [[Wikipedia:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers ]], the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park Service ]], and the [[Wikipedia:United States Geological Survey|United States Geological Survey ]], shall lead a multiagency effort to slow the spread of Asian Carp in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins and tributaries by providing high-level technical assistance, coordination, best practices, and support to State and local government strategies to slow, and eventually eliminate, the threat posed by Asian Carp. To the maximum extent practicable, the multiagency effort shall apply lessons learned and best practices such as those developed under the Management and Control Plan for Bighead, Black, Grass, and Silver Carps in the United States, November 2007 and the Asian Carp Control Strategic Framework.
