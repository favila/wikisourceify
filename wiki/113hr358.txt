			 Invasion Act”.

[[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The rapid spread
			 of several invasive species of Asian Carp in the Upper Mississippi River and
			 Ohio River basins and tributaries threatens ecosystems and billions of dollars
			 of economic activities connected to outdoor recreation in States throughout the
			 Midwest.
:(2) While Federal
			 efforts have focused on preventing the spread of Asian Carp into the Great
			 Lakes, there is growing recognition of the threat these invasive species pose
			 to other ecosystems in the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River basins.
