{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 350thAnniversary of the founding of the State of New Jersey and honoring the valuable contributions of people of the Garden State.    Whereas, in 1664, the parcel of land between the Delaware and Hudson Rivers came under the control of the English, who named the land New Jersey;   Whereas the State of New Jersey played an instrumental role in the success of the 13 original colonies during the American Revolutionary War, serving as the location of more military engagements than any other colony during the American Revolutionary War, including 2 pivotal colonial victories at Trenton and Princeton in the winter of 1776;   Whereas, in 1789, the State of New Jersey became the first state in the United States of America to ratify the Bill of Rights, which is the first 10 amendments to the United States Constitution;   Whereas men and women of the State of New Jersey, such as Thomas Mundy Peterson, Alice Paul, and Paul Robeson, bravely challenged our country to recognize and support equal and just rights of citizenship for all people of the United States;   Whereas the State of New Jersey has been a veritable cauldron of culture, contributing iconic and talented artists in literature, film, theater, dance, music, and visual arts;   Whereas world renowned scientists and scholars, including Thomas Alva Edison and Albert Einstein, conduct their research and launch their discoveries in laboratories and institutions throughout the State of New Jersey, resulting in the State of New Jersey serving as a birth place for inventions and innovations that fundamentally change the way humans interact with each other and the world around them;   Whereas the State of New Jersey has been a leader in developing and engineering formative infrastructure and transportation accomplishments, from the Morris Canal and the Delaware and Raritan Canal to the iconic Garden State Parkway, as well as the now ubiquitous“Jersey Barriers”that provide for the safety of drivers and passengers on roads throughout the United States;   Whereas, in 1954, the New Jersey State Legislature passed legislation for the State of New Jersey to officially adopt the nickname of the“Garden State”, a proud acknowledgment of the State of New Jersey's strong agricultural heritage and reflection of the continued abundance of blueberries, cranberries, peaches, and other produce that contribute to the State of New Jersey’s robust agricultural industry;   Whereas New Jerseyans take pride in enjoying and preserving the State of New Jersey's vast natural resources, including the 130 miles of sandy beaches along“the shore”, as well as the 1,000,000 acres of Pine Barrens that constitute the United State’s first National Reserve; and   Whereas it is fitting and desirable that the people of New Jersey and the United States celebrate the current and historic role of the State of New Jersey in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
