{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for the expansion of Federal efforts concerning the prevention, education, treatment, and research activities related to Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including the establishment of a Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can cause serious health problems.
:(2) Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which belongs to the class of spirochetes, and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Early signs of infection may include a rash and flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue.
:(3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed. Untreated, Lyme disease can lead to severe heart, neurological, eye, and joint problems because the bacteria can affect many different organs and organ systems.
:(4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, neurological, eye, and joint problems.
:(5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all vector-borne infections in the United States, the ticks that spread Lyme disease also spread other diseases, such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and tularemia, and carry Bartonella and other strains of Borrelia. Other tick species, such as the aggressive lone star, spread ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). Multiple diseases in 1 patient make diagnosis and treatment more difficult.
:(6) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 33,000 confirmed or probable Lyme Disease cases in 2011.
:(7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1992 to 2006, the incidence of Lyme disease was highest among children aged 5 to 14 years of age.
:(8) Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without reliable testing makes diagnosis and treatment of patients more difficult.
