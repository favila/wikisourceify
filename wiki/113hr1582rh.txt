Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] may not promulgate as final an energy-related rule that is estimated to cost more than $1 billion if the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] determines under section 3(3)that the rule will cause significant adverse effects to the economy.

:(E) an estimate of the increases in energy prices, including potential increases in gasoline or electricity prices for consumers, that may result from implementation or enforcement of the rule; and
:(F) a detailed description of the employment effects, including potential job losses and shifts in employment, that may result from implementation or enforcement of the rule.

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] , in consultation with the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] and the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Administrator of the Energy Information Administration]] , shall prepare an independent analysis to determine whether the rule will cause—

:(B) any impact on fuel diversity of the Nation’s electricity generation portfolio or on national, regional, or local electric reliability;
:(C) any adverse effect on energy supply, distribution, or use due to the economic or technical infeasibility of implementing the rule; or

==(3) Subsequent determination on adverse effects to the economy– ==

If the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] determines, under paragraph (2), that the rule will cause an increase, impact, or effect described in such paragraph, then the Secretary, in consultation with the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] , the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] , the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] , and the [[w:Small Business Administration|Administrator of the Small Business Administration]] , shall—
:(A) determine whether the rule will cause significant adverse effects to the economy, taking into consideration—
::(i) the costs and benefits of the rule and limitations in calculating such costs and benefits due to uncertainty, speculation, or lack of information; and

:(B) publish the results of such determination in the Federal Register.
