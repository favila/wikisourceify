{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize a bipartisan majority of Commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission to hold nonpublic collaborative discussions, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Federal Communications Commission Collaboration Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Commissioners of the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] (in this section referred to as the Commission ), past and present, have stated that, while they support the intent of [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552b section 552b of title 5, United States Code] , the implementation of that section has hindered the ability of the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] to have a substantive exchange of ideas and hold collective deliberations on issues pending before the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] .
:(2) The principal purpose of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] in creating a multimember agency is to obtain the benefits of collegial decisionmaking by the members of the agency, who bring to the decisionmaking process different philosophical perspectives, experiences, and areas of expertise.
:(3) Commissioners have relied primarily on an inefficient combination of written messages, communications among staff, and a series of meetings restricted to 2 Commissioners at each such meeting to discuss complex telecommunications matters pending before the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] .
:(4) Extensive use of such methods of communication has harmed collegiality and cooperation at the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] .
:(5) Numerous regulatory matters have been pending before the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] for years, and continued inaction on these issues has the potential to hinder innovation and private investment in the domestic communications industry.
:(6) The [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] must be able to work more collaboratively and efficiently than in the past to meet the current challenge of expanding broadband Internet access to the extent necessary to serve the business, educational, health, and cultural needs of all people in the United States.

=Sec. 3. Nonpublic collaborative discussions of the Federal Communications Commission=

 Section 4 of the Communications Act of 1934( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/154 47 U.S.C. 154] )is amended by adding at the end the following:
