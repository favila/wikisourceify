{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of Congress relating to the commemoration of the 180th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Kingdom of Thailand.    Whereas 2013 marks the 180th anniversary of the March 20, 1833, signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and the Kingdom of Thailand (formerly known as Siam), which initiated diplomatic relations between the two countries during the administration of President Andrew Jackson and the reign of King Rama III;   Whereas Thailand was the first treaty ally of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region and remains a steadfast friend of the United States with shared values of democracy, rule of law, universal human rights, human security, open societies, and a free market;   Whereas in December 2003, the United States designated Thailand as a major ally outside the [[w:NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] , which improved the security of both countries, particularly by facilitating joint counterterrorism efforts;   Whereas for more than 30 years, Thailand has been the host country of Cobra Gold, the United States Pacific Command's annual multinational military training exercise, which is designed to ensure regional peace and promote regional security cooperation;   Whereas Thailand has played a leading role in the development of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations by helping the regional group develop into a more cohesive and comprehensive entity that ensures regional security and prosperity and serves as a valued partner in Asia for the United States;   Whereas, on December 5, 2012, the people of Thailand celebrated the 85th birthday of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-serving monarch, who is loved and respected for his lifelong dedication to the social and economic development of the people of Thailand;   Whereas, on July 3, 2011, the Royal Thai Government held nationwide parliamentary elections, the results of which affirmed Thailand’s commitment to the democratic process;   Whereas approximately 500,000 people of Thai descent live in the United States, joining in the pursuit of the American Dream;   Whereas Thailand is a valued trading partner of the United States, with bilateral trade totaling approximately $40,000,000,000 per year; and   Whereas the bonds of friendship and mutual respect between the United States and Thailand are strong: Now, therefore, be it
