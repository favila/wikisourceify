Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any State educational agency or local educational agency that enters into a contract or other agreement with a school-based health center relating to the provision of health services to students served by the agency unless such center certifies that—
:(1) the center will not perform an abortion; and
:(2) the center will not provide abortion-related materials, referrals, or directions for abortion services to any such student.

===(b) Rule of construction– ===

Nothing in this part shall be construed to prevent a school-based health center from providing non-abortion health services to pregnant students.
