{{Center|A BILL}}

 To repeal certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act relating to the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Federal Repeal of Expensive Exchanges Act ”or the“ FREE Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act makes health care more expensive and less accessible, while also driving up the Federal deficit and debt.
:(2) This increase in cost is most noticeable in the health insurance exchanges established under such Act, which would increase the Federal deficit by $1.017 trillion over an eleven-year timeframe, as stated in a July, 2012 Congressional Budget Office report.
:(3) The Federal mandate to establish health insurance exchanges directly assaults the States’ traditional authority to regulate health insurance.
:(4) Such Federal mandate imposes unknown insurance costs on consumers and administrative costs on States.
:(5) Such Federal mandate imposes a one-size-fits-all approach that ignores State differences.
:(6) Such Federal mandate undermines choice and competition and guarantees further consolidation of the health insurance markets.
