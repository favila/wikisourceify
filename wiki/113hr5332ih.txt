{{Center|A BILL}}

 To promote identification of veterans and their health needs in furnishing of items and services under the Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title; findings=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the “   Serving America’s Veterans Effectively Act of 2014   ”or the“   SAVE Act of 2014   ”. 

==(b) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) Veterans often have unique health needs that may be related to their service to the American people and may be more at risk for certain conditions, including cancer, infectious diseases, musculoskeletal problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, dermatological problems, reproductive health issues, and other conditions.
:(2) As part of a detailed patient history, knowing whether or not a patient is a veteran helps a physician to make accurate treatment recommendations or carry out needed screenings.
:(3) If a physician is not aware that a patient is a veteran, the physician may not think to perform recommended screenings or be able to diagnose symptoms that at first seemed unconnected. As a result, the patient and the patient’s family may suffer as medical problems go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
:(4) Physicians routinely ask about similar types of patient history that can affect current health status, such as whether a patient has a family history of certain conditions or was exposed to certain environmental factors. Questions about veteran status give patients the opportunity to voluntarily answer with information that can help their physicians better establish a course of treatment.
:(5) Making the question of whether a patient served in the Armed Forces part of consistently used frameworks, such as the “Welcome to Medicare” physical examination and Medicare Electronic Health Record program, ensures that it will become part of clinicians’ routine for new patients.
:(6) While many physicians, such as those working at [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]facilities, may already be aware of their patients’ experiences in the Armed Forces, there are indications that as much as 70 percent of veterans seek care from other facilities.
:(7) Many organizations serving both veterans and health care professionals currently work to educate health providers on the health needs of veterans and appropriate medical care that should be provided. Additional Federal support is needed to ensure that all physicians are properly prepared to diagnose and treat patients upon learning that they have served in the Armed Forces.
