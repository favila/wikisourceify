 To prohibit the Department of the Treasury from assigning tax statuses to organizations based on their political beliefs and activities.   

=Section 1. Prohibiting tax status from being assigned based on political beliefs and activities=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The income tax system of the United States relies on voluntary compliance by taxpayers.
:(2) The filing of tax returns and other tax-related documents with the Internal Revenue Service often requires the submission of information to the Federal government that taxpayers would otherwise consider private.
:(3) To ensure widespread voluntary compliance by taxpayers, the American public must have absolute trust that the Internal Revenue Service is acting in a non-partisan manner.
:(4) Taxpayers must be ensured that their treatment by the Internal Revenue Service will not be based on race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or political creed, including their support for or opposition to any government policies.
:(5) The confidence of taxpayers in the system of taxation in the United States is compromised when the Internal Revenue Service is required to assign tax treatment based on political beliefs or activities.
:(6) The targeting of certain individuals and groups by the Internal Revenue Services based on their political beliefs and activities must be stopped, and to ensure the integrity of the income tax system of the United States, the Internal Revenue Service should be removed from evaluating the political activities of any individuals or organizations.

==(b) Political organizations– ==

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/527 Paragraph (1) ofsection 527(e)of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986]is amended to read as follows:
