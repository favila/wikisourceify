{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish fair and transparent practices related to the marketing and provision of overdraft coverage programs at depository institutions, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Overdraft Protection Act of 2013”.

2. Findings and purpose


Section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 ) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:


=(c) Fairness and accountability in overdraft coverage=


==(1) Findings==

The Congress also finds that—: overdraft coverage is a form of short-term credit that depository institutions provide for consumer transaction accounts. Historically, depository institutions covered overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc basis;: with the growth in specially designed software programs and in consumer use of debit cards, overdraft coverage for a fee has become more prevalent;: many depository institutions offer a range of overdraft options but aggressively encourage consumers to consent to the most expensive option, where a high flat fee is collected for every individual overdraft transaction;: most depository institutions collect a high flat fee, including for small dollar transactions, each time the institution covers an overdraft, in some cases impose multiple overdraft coverage fees within a single day, and many charge additional fees for each day during which the account remains overdrawn; and: such abusive practices in connection with overdraft coverage fees have deprived consumers of meaningful choices about their accounts and placed significant financial burdens on low- and moderate-income consumers.
==(2) Purpose==

It is the purpose of this title to protect consumers by limiting abusive overdraft coverage fees and practices, and by providing meaningful disclosures and consumer choice in connection with overdraft coverage fees..

3. Definitions

The term overdraft coverage fee means any fee or charge assessed in connection with overdraft coverage, or in connection with any negative account balance that results from overdraft coverage, unless such fee or charge is imposed in connection with—: an extension of credit through an overdraft line of credit program where such fee or charge was considered a finance charge under this title as in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Overdraft Protection Act of 2012 ; or: any transfer from an account linked to another transaction account.Such fee shall be considered a finance charge for purposes of section 106(a) , but shall not be included in the calculation of the rate of interest for purposes of section 107(5)(A)(vi) of the Federal Credit Union Act ( 12 U.S.C. 1757(5)(A)(vi) ) .

=(b) Conforming amendment=
