{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish fair and transparent practices related to the marketing and provision of overdraft coverage programs at depository institutions, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H9C2C6B783BC846F1AFEC220CD4F36A8D}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Overdraft Protection Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H101780A551324B409EF7DD26386D90DC}}Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=

 Section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// 15 U.S.C. 1601] )is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

<blockquote>

=={{anchor|HA8FE1515EB1A43EA8BEB4A680EF51784}}(c) Fairness and accountability in overdraft coverage– ==



==={{anchor|H6BAEBAC034A34EE891B1B03FB92B0105}}(1) Findings– ===

The Congress also finds that—
:(A) overdraft coverage is a form of short-term credit that depository institutions provide for consumer transaction accounts. Historically, depository institutions covered overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc basis;
:(B) with the growth in specially designed software programs and in consumer use of debit cards, overdraft coverage for a fee has become more prevalent;
:(C) many depository institutions offer a range of overdraft options but aggressively encourage consumers to consent to the most expensive option, where a high flat fee is collected for every individual overdraft transaction;
:(D) most depository institutions collect a high flat fee, including for small dollar transactions, each time the institution covers an overdraft, in some cases impose multiple overdraft coverage fees within a single day, and many charge additional fees for each day during which the account remains overdrawn; and
:(E) such abusive practices in connection with overdraft coverage fees have deprived consumers of meaningful choices about their accounts and placed significant financial burdens on low- and moderate-income consumers.

==={{anchor|HB472A38BCEC8419185EC34B9C05E4301}}(2) Purpose– ===

It is the purpose of this title to protect consumers by limiting abusive overdraft coverage fees and practices, and by providing meaningful disclosures and consumer choice in connection with overdraft coverage fees..
