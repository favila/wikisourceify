{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating June 2014 as“National Aphasia Awareness Month”and supporting efforts to increase awareness of aphasia.    Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by brain damage that typically results from a stroke;   Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological disorders, such as a brain tumor;   Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls language and movement on the right side of the body;   Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of, or reduction in, the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains intact;   Whereas, according to the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]](referred to in this preamble as the“NINDS”), strokes are the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States;   Whereas strokes are a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States;   Whereas the [[w:National Institutes of Health|NINDS]]estimates that there are approximately 5,000,000 stroke survivors in the United States;   Whereas the [[w:National Institutes of Health|NINDS]]estimates that people in the United States suffer approximately 795,000 strokes per year, with about1/3of the strokes resulting in aphasia;   Whereas, according to the [[w:National Institutes of Health|NINDS]], aphasia affects at least 1,000,000 people in the United States;   Whereas the [[w:National Institutes of Health|NINDS]]estimates that more than 200,000 people in the United States are afflicted with aphasia each year;   Whereas the people of the United States should strive to learn more about aphasia and to promote research, rehabilitation, and support services for people with aphasia and aphasia caregivers throughout the United States; and   Whereas people with aphasia and their caregivers envision a world that recognizes the“silent”disability of aphasia and provides opportunity and fulfillment for people affected by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]—
:(1) designates June 2014 as“National Aphasia Awareness Month”;
:(2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;
:(3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, are the fourth-largest cause of death and disability in the United States;
:(4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and study to find new solutions for people experiencing aphasia and their caregivers;
:(5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable to communicate with others; and
