{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into contracts with health care providers to improve health care access and care coordination for veterans, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title; sense of Congress=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“ Veteran-Centered Access to Coordinated Health Care Act of 2014 ”.

==(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) veterans who are authorized by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]]to receive health care in the community must not lose the high quality, safety, care coordination, and other veteran-centric elements that the health care system of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]provides;
:(2) many veterans receive health care from both the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]]and community providers but the lack of care coordination among the Department and community providers when veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite health care resources;
:(3) veteran-centric care coordination is associated with improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the best care for veterans; and
:(4) if the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]purchases care for veterans from the private sector, such care must be secured in a cost-effective manner, in a way that complements the larger health care system of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]]by using industry standards for care and costs. 

=Sec. 2. Comprehensive contract care coordination program for veterans=
