Although effective security checks are needed to ensure that the United States and the Nation’s refugee admissions program are adequately protected, it is the sense of the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that the failure to properly coordinate security and non-security clearance procedures has had negative impacts on the processing of vulnerable individuals who are in need of, and eligible for, resettlement to the United States.
