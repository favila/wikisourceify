{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must allow taxpayers the same lame excuses for missing documentation that the IRS itself is currently proffering.    The resolution may be cited as the“  Dog Ate My Tax Receipts Resolution  ”.   Whereas, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]claims that convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous computer malfunction is sufficient justification not to produce specific, critical documentation; and   Whereas, fairness and Due Process demand that the American taxpayer be granted no less latitude than we afford the bureaucrats employed presently at the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]that unless and until the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]]produces all documentation demanded by subpoena or otherwise by the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], or produces an excuse that passes the red face test,  All taxpayers shall be given the benefit of the doubt when not producing critical documentation, so long as the taxpayer’s excuse therefore falls into one of the following categories: 
:(1) The dog ate my tax receipts 
:(2) Convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous computer malfunction 
:(3) Traded documents for five terrorists 
:(4) Burned for warmth while lost in the Yukon 
:(5) Left on table in Hillary’s Book Room 
:(6) Received water damage in the trunk of Ted Kennedy’s car 
:(7) Forgot in gun case sold to Mexican drug lords 
:(8) Forced to recycle by municipal Green Czar 
:(9) Was short on toilet paper while camping 
:(10) At this point, what difference does it make? In any case, [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]can see the [[w:National Security Agency/Central Security Service|NSA]]for a good, high quality copy.
