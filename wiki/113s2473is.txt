=Sec. 2. Findings; statement of policy=



==(a) Findings– ==

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The United States is the global leader in wireless communications and broadband technologies, both of which are vital parts of daily life in the United States, key components of the national infrastructure of the United States, and a significant driver of the United States economy.
:(2) Wireless communications and broadband services have become critical for individuals to improve their economic well-being, businesses to compete in the 21st century, first responders to protect individuals in emergencies, and Federal agencies to service their missions, such as national defense.
:(3) Because of the proliferation of broadband connected wireless devices and consumer applications, the volume of data traffic traveling over wireless networks has been growing substantially, and with the pace of innovation accelerating, the demand for wireless data services will continue to increase exponentially.
:(4) The [[w:Council of Economic Advisors|Council of Economic Advisors]]has concluded that the only feasible way to realize the full potential of wireless broadband is to make new spectrum available for wireless services, and considerable spectrum is underused or used in less economically valuable ways, and could be repurposed and reallocated for wireless broadband use.
:(5) If the United States does not make more spectrum available, scarcity of spectrum could lead to higher prices for wireless services, poor service quality, the inability of the United States to compete internationally, constrained mobile broadband growth, and ultimately, a drag on innovation and individual economic mobility.
:(6) The National Broadband Plan, created by the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]], set a goal of making 500 megahertz of spectrum newly available for commercial mobile broadband use by 2020, including making 300 megahertz between 225 megahertz and 3.7 gigahertz newly available for mobile use within 5 years, and stated that reallocating this spectrum where possible for mobile broadband use should be a priority.
:(7) Reallocating and auctioning spectrum produces multiple benefits. A Federal licensee can upgrade to comparable or superior communications technology, an auction raises money for the United States Treasury, and taxpayers benefit from increased access to, and better use of, spectrum.
:(8) In addition to reallocating spectrum, the United States should pursue a comprehensive approach to spectrum policy that includes expanding the capacity of wireless networks, promoting secondary spectrum markets, expanding unlicensed networks and Wi-Fi systems, and increasing efficiency and transparency among Federal users.
:(9) The Federal Government, as the largest user of spectrum, must also promote the efficient use of spectrum resources, and the [[w:National Telecommunications and Information Administration|National Telecommunications and Information Administration]]must ensure that Federal agencies use this valuable public resource in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
:(10) The National Broadband Plan states that Federal spectrum users can be more efficient with the airwaves allocated to them by the [[w:National Telecommunications and Information Administration|National Telecommunications and Information Administration]], especially as wireless needs and technology evolve over time.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is—
:(1) to pursue comprehensive solutions to expand mobile broadband and utilize wireless services and technologies to create jobs, grow the economy, and improve individual economic mobility; and
:(2) to ensure that the Federal Government—
::(A) utilizes its spectrum in the most efficient and effective way; and
::(B) repurposes spectrum for commercial use wherever possible.

===(2) Scope– ===

The framework developed under paragraph (1) shall cover all federally allocated spectrum bands between 150 megahertz and 6000 megahertz, inclusive.

===(3) Goals– ===

The goals of the framework developed under paragraph (1) are—

:(B) to provide the public with increased transparency about how Federal entities use a scarce physical resource.

===(4) Requirements– ===

The framework developed under paragraph (1) shall—
:(A) define the term opportunity cost as the value of the spectrum, in dollar terms, as if such spectrum were to be reallocated on a licensed basis to the highest commercial alternative use that currently does not have access to that spectrum;
:(B) be updated, on an annual basis, to take into account observed market valuations from spectrum auctions, secondary spectrum trading, and other market indicators of spectrum value;
:(C) determine the opportunity costs borne by each Federal entity for each spectrum band that is entirely under the control of a single agency; and
:(D) determine the opportunity costs for spectrum assigned or otherwise allocated to Federal entities for both primary use and secondary use.

==(b) Report on opportunity costs– ==

Each Federal entity that has been assigned or otherwise allocated use of a Federal spectrum band shall report, as an off-budget item, the opportunity cost borne by the entity for each spectrum band the entity uses—
:(1) in the budget of the entity to be included in the budget of the United States Government submitted by the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1105  section 1105of title 31, United States Code]; and

==(c) Spectrum value analysis– ==

Not later than 5 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, each Federal entity that has been assigned or otherwise allocated use of a Federal spectrum band, or otherwise utilizes such spectrum, shall engage in an analysis comparing the opportunity cost of that spectrum, as such cost is determined by the framework developed by the [[w:National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]]under subsection (a) , to the projected costs of the entity relocating to other government spectrum holdings, co-locating with other government agencies, leasing other non-Federal spectrum, or contracting out for its spectrum activities.

==(d) Spectrum technology study– ==



===(1) In general– ===
