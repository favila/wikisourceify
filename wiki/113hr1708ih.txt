{{Center|A BILL}}

To suspend temporarily the duty on certain footwear, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Affordable Footwear Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Average collected duties on imported footwear are among the highest of any product sector, totaling approximately $2,300,000,000 in 2011 and approximately $2,500,000,000 in 2012.
:(2) Duty rates on imported footwear are among the highest imposed by the United States Government, with some as high as the equivalent of 67.5 percent ad valorem.
:(3) The duties currently imposed by the United States were set in an era during which high rates of duty were intended to protect production of footwear in the United States.
:(4) Footwear produced in the United States supplies only about 1 percent of the total United States market for footwear. This production is concentrated in distinct product groupings, which are not affected by the provisions of this Act.
:(5) Footwear duties, which are higher on lower-price footwear, serve no purpose and are a hidden, regressive tax on those people in the United States least able to pay.
:(6) Low- and moderate-income families spend a larger share of their disposable income on footwear than higher-income families.
:(7) The outdoor industry develops innovative and high performance footwear that promotes healthy and active lifestyles through outdoor recreation.

=Sec. 3. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) there is no production in the United States of many footwear articles;
:(2) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles will not negatively affect manufacturing or employment in the United States; and
:(3) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles will result in reduced retail prices for a wide range of consumers.

=Sec. 4. Temporary elimination or reduction of duties on certain footwear=
