{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of International Water Safety Day.    Whereas International Water Safety Day is celebrated to bring awareness to the ongoing drowning epidemic and educate people in becoming safer in and around the water;   Whereas fatal unintentional drowning is the second leading cause of death for children 1 to 14 years of age;   Whereas fatal unintentional drowning is the sixth leading cause of death for people of all ages;   Whereas an estimated 388,000 people died from drowning, making drowning a major public health problem worldwide and accounting for nearly 10 percent of total global mortality;   Whereas drowning deaths are an epidemic;   Whereas drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury death, accounting for 7 percent of all injury-related deaths;   Whereas water safety education and water safety awareness can help curve the number of drowning fatalities;   Whereas research shows that formal swimming lessons can reduce the risk of drowning by 88 percent among children aged 1 to 4 years old;   Whereas courses such as CPR have shown to improve outcomes for drowning victims since interventions occur more quickly;   Whereas water safety is a life skill that can be taught; and   Whereas water safety education should be included in primary and secondary school education: Now, therefore, be it
