{{Center|A BILL}}

To prohibit discrimination in adoption or foster care placements based on the sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status of any prospective adoptive or foster parent, or the sexual orientation or gender identity of the child involved.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Every Child Deserves a Family Act” .

=Sec. 2. Congressional findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) There is a shortage of qualified individuals willing to adopt or foster a child in the child welfare system. As a result, thousands of foster children lack a permanent and safe home.
:(2) In order to open more homes to foster children, child welfare agencies should work to eliminate sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status discrimination and bias in adoption and foster care recruitment, selection, and placement procedures.
:(3) Of the estimated 400,000 children in the United States foster care system, more than 104,000 cannot return to their original families and are legally free for adoption.
::(A) 50,516 children were adopted in 2011, while 26,286 youth “aged out” of the foster care system.
::(B) Research shows that youth who “age out” of the foster care system are at a high risk for poverty, homelessness, incarceration, and early parenthood.
::(C) Increasing adoption rates, in addition to establishing permanency and decreasing risk factors for foster youth, can yield annual national cost savings between $3,300,000,000 and $6,300,000,000.
:(4) Experts agree that in many States, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth experience discrimination, harassment, and violence in the foster care system because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
:(5) Approximately 60 percent of homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth were previously in foster care. According to the Urban Justice Center, many of these young people reported that living on the streets felt “safer” than living in their group or foster home.
:(6) According to the Williams Institute, an estimated 19 percent of same-sex couple households include children under 18 years of age.
:(7) The Williams Institute estimates that 3,000,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people have had a child and as many as 6,000,000 American adults and children have a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender parent. Among adults under 50 years of age living alone or with a spouse or partner, 48 percent of lesbian, bisexual, or transgender women are raising a child under 18 years of age, and 20 percent of gay, bisexual, or transgender men are doing so.
:(8) As of 2013, same-sex couples are raising 1.4 percent of adopted children with 2 parents and are fostering 1.7 percent of foster children living with 2 parents. A 2007 report from the Williams Institute found that an additional 2,000,000 gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are interested in adoption.
:(9) According to the Williams Institute/Urban Institute, same-sex couples raising adopted children tend to be older than, just as educated as, and have access to the same economic resources as other adoptive parents. Studies confirm that children with same-sex parents have the same advantages and same expectations for health, social, and psychological adjustment, and development as children whose parents are heterosexual.
:(10) An Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute study found that1/3of child welfare agencies in the United States reject gay, lesbian, and bisexual applicants.
::(A) The practice of prohibiting applicants from becoming foster parents or adopting children solely on the basis of sexual orientation or marital status has resulted in reducing the number of qualified adoptive and foster parents overall and denying gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried relatives the opportunity to become foster parents for their own kin, including grandchildren, or to adopt their own kin, including grandchildren, from foster care.
::(B) According to the Williams Institute, more than 3,400 children are currently in foster placements with same-sex couples. Another 22,000 children are being raised by same-sex adoptive couples. If other States followed the minority of States and discriminated against qualified individuals because of their sexual orientation or marital status, foster care expenditures would increase between $87,000,000 and $130,000,000 per year in order to pay for additional institutional and group care, as well as to recruit and train new foster and adoptive parents.
:(11) Some States allow 1 member of a same-sex couple to adopt, but do not recognize both members of the couple as the child’s legal parents. Recognition of joint adoption provides children with the same rights and security that children of heterosexual parents enjoy. These protections include access to both parents’ health benefits, survivor’s, Social Security, and child support entitlements, legal grounds for either parent to provide consent for medical care, education, and other important decisions, as well as the establishment of permanency for parents and child.
:(12) Professional organizations in the fields of medicine, psychology, law, and child welfare have taken official positions in support of the ability of qualified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried couples to foster and adopt a child, as supported by scientific research showing sexual orientation as a nondeterminative factor in parental success.
:(13) Discrimination against potential foster or adoptive parents based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status is not in the best interests of children in the foster care system.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are to decrease the length of time that children wait for permanency with a loving family and to promote the best interests of children in the child welfare system by preventing discrimination in adoption and foster care placements based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.
