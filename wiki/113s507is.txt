:(2) a panel of experts convened by the President’s Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in 2001—
::(A) stated that“the development and use of the atomic bomb during World War II has been called“the single most significant event of the 20th century””; and
::(B) recommended that nationally significant sites associated with the Manhattan Project be formally established as a collective unit and be administered for preservation, commemoration, and public interpretation in cooperation with the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]] ;
:(3) the Manhattan Project National Historical Park Study Act([[Public Law -|Public Law 108–340]] ;118 Stat. 1362)directed the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] , in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] , to conduct a special resource study of the historically significant sites associated with the Manhattan Project to assess the national significance, suitability, and feasibility of designating 1 or more sites as a unit of the [[w:National Park Service|National Park System]] ;
:(4) after significant public input, the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]] study found that“including Manhattan Project-related sites in the national park system will expand and enhance the protection and preservation of such resources and provide for comprehensive interpretation and public understanding of this nationally significant story in the 20th century American history”;
:(5) the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] , with the concurrence of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] , recommended the establishment of a Manhattan Project National Historical Park comprised of resources at—

:(7) the permanent historical preservation of the B Reactor at Hanford as part of the Manhattan National Historical Park would provide significant savings to the Federal Government relative to placing the reactor into interim safe storage and subsequently dismantling the reactor—
::(A) as determined as part of the Record of Decision entitled ‘‘Decommissioning of Eight Surplus Production 3 Reactors at the Hanford Site, Richland, WA’’; and
::(B) as included within milestone M–093–00 of the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order.
