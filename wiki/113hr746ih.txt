 To provide small businesses with a grace period for a regulatory violation, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Protect Small Business Jobs Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. In general=

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 Section 558 of title 5, United States Code], is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 
:(d) Before any enforcement action is taken on any sanction on a business for any violation of a rule or pursuant to an adjudication an agency shall—
::(1) not later than 10 business days after the date on which the agency determines that a sanction may be imposed on the business, provide notice to the business that, if the business is a small business as defined in subsection (k), the small business may be subject to a sanction at the end of the grace period described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (3)];
::(2) delay any further action for a period of 15 calendar days;
::(3) for any small business, defer any further action for a period of not less than 6 months, less the 15 days described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (2)], which shall be extended by an additional period of 3 months on application by the small business demonstrating reasonable efforts made in good faith to remedy the violation or other conduct giving rise to the sanction;
::(4) make a further determination after the period described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (3)]as to whether or not the small business would still be subject to the sanction as of the end of that period;
::(5) if the determination under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (4)]is that the small business would not be subject to the sanction, waive the sanction; and
::(6) if notice is given more than 10 business days after the date on which the agency determines that a sanction may be imposed on the business, and the agency determines that the same sanction may have been imposed on the business 10 business days prior to the date of the notice, that date of notice shall be the effective date commencing the grace period described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (3)]. 
:(e) The grace period described by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)]shall be applicable only once per business per rule, but shall cover subsequent violations of the same rule until it expires. 
:(f) The grace period described by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)]shall not apply to a violation that puts anyone in imminent danger, as defined by the  Occupational Safety and Health Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/662 29 U.S.C. 662 et seq.]). 
:(g) Nothing in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)]shall be construed to prevent a small business from appealing any sanction imposed in accordance with the procedures of the agency, or from seeking review underchapter 7 of this title. 
:(h) Any sanction by an agency on a small business for any violation of a rule or pursuant to an adjudication, absent proof of written notice of the sanction and the date on which the agency determined that a sanction may be imposed, or in violation of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)(3)], shall be null and void. 
:(i) Federal agencies shall report annually to the Ombudsman on the utilization of this directive and disclose the penalty mitigation for small businesses. 
:(j) The Ombudsman shall include in its annual report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]the agency reports described by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (i)]and a summary of the findings. 
:(k) For purposes of this section—
::(1) term“small business”is defined as any sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, or other business entity, that—
:::(A) had less than $10,000,000 in gross receipts in the preceding calendar year;
:::(B) is considered a“small-business concern”as such term is defined pursuant to  Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/632 15 U.S.C. 632(a)]);
:::(C) employed fewer than 200 individuals in the preceding calendar year; or
:::(D) had CPI adjusted gross receipts of less than $10,000,000 in the preceding year.
::(2) the term“Ombudsman”has the same meaning given such term in  section 30(a) of the Small Business Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/657 15 U.S.C. 657(a)]);
::(3) the term“consumer price index”means the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]; and
::(4) the term“CPI adjusted gross receipts”means the amount of gross receipts, divided by the consumer price index for calendar year 2012, and multiplied by the consumer price index for the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100,000 (or, if midway between multiples of $100,000, to the next higher multiple of $100,000). .
