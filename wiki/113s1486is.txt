The [[w:United States Postal Service|Board of Governors of the Postal Service]] shall establish, and may from time to time thereafter revise, a system of classes and rates for market-dominant products, consistent with the requirements of this section. The authority under this section may not be delegated to the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postmaster General]] or to any other individual or body.

=====(b) Objectives– =====

Such system shall be designed to achieve the following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction with the others:

:(4) To assure adequate revenues, including retained earnings, to maintain financial stability.

=====(c) Factors– =====

In establishing or revising such system, the [[w:United States Postal Service|Board of Governors]] shall take into account—

:(3) the effect of rate increases upon the general public, business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than letters;
:(4) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;
:(5) the simplicity of structure for the entire schedule and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees charged the various classes of mail for postal services;
:(6) the relative value to the people of the kinds of mail matter entered into the postal system and the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail;
:(7) the importance of providing classifications with extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and of providing those that do not require high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery;
:(8) the desirability of special classifications for both postal users and the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] in accordance with the policies of this title;
:(9) the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter;
:(10) the need for the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] to increase its efficiency and reduce its costs, including infrastructure costs, to help maintain high quality, affordable postal services;
:(11) the value to the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] and postal users of promoting intelligent mail and of secure, sender-identified mail; and
