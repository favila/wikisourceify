::(2)  [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] facilities shall be deemed to be geographically inaccessible for purposes of [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1703 paragraph (1)] in the case of a veteran whose residence meets any of the following criteria:
:::(A) The residence is in a county with a population density of less than 7.0 people per square mile and is more than 75 miles from the nearest [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] health care facility.
:::(B) The residence is in a county with a population density of more than 7.0 and less than 8.0 people per square mile and is more than 100 miles from the nearest Department health care facility.

::(4) For purposes of [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1703 paragraph (2)] , a distance in miles shall be determined on the basis of the most convenient highway route that is available to the veteran, as determined by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] ..
