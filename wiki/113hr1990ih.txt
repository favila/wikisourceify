=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On May 10, 2013, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] admitted that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, seeking tax-exempt status.

:(3) This action could be an indication of future [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] abuses in relation to[[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-48|Public Law 111–48]] ]] and[[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-52|Public Law 111–52]] ]] given that it is their responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual mandate.
:(4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the Federal Government.

=Sec. 3. Prohibiting enforcement of PPACA and HCERA=

The [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] , or any delegate of the Secretary, shall not implement or enforce any provisions of or amendments made by[[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]] ]] or[[Public Law 111-152|111–152]] .
