      Whereas the first Africans were brought involuntarily to
			 the shores of the America as early as the 17th century;
		
    
      Whereas these Africans in America and their descendants
			 are now known as African-Americans;
		
    
      Whereas African-Americans suffered enslavement and
			 subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, and denial of
			 basic, fundamental rights;
		
    
      Whereas despite slavery, African-Americans in all walks of
			 life have made significant contributions throughout the history of the United
			 States, including through the—
			
        (1)
        writings of Booker
			 T. Washington, Phyllis Wheatley, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Ralph Ellison,
			 Zora Neale Hurston, and Alex Haley;

        music of Mahalia

        (6)
        bravery of those
			 who stood on the front lines in the battle against oppression, such as
			 Sojourner Truth, Fannie Lou Hammer, and Rosa Parks;
			
    
    
      Whereas in the face of injustices, United States citizens
			 of good will and of all races distinguished themselves with their commitment to
			 the noble ideals upon which the United States was founded and courageously
			 fought for the rights and freedom of African-Americans;
		
    
      Whereas Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., lived and died to
			 make real these noble ideas;
		
    
      Whereas a memorial commemorating the life and ideals of
			 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was placed on the National Mall for all people to
