{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the efforts of the National Park Service and others in restoring and repairing the Washington Monument.    Whereas the employees of the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]work tirelessly to maintain the beauty of the 401 national parks of the United States, revitalize communities, preserve local history, celebrate local heritage, and create outdoor recreation for children and families;   Whereas the Washington Monument was built between 1848 and 1884 to commemorate George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and the first [[w:President of the United States|President of the United States]];   Whereas the Washington Monument is a symbol of unity and freedom in the United States and is the distinguishing feature of the skyline in Washington, DC;   Whereas the Washington Monument is admired by more than 25,000,000 individuals who visit The National Mall each year;   Whereas the Washington Monument was closed for over 2½ years for necessary repairs after being damaged by an earthquake in 2011;   Whereas engineers examined each of the 9,040 marble stones on the exterior of the Washington Monument and many of the more than 10,000 granite stones on the interior of the monument to ensure that the repair of the monument was sound and complete;   Whereas during the rehabilitation, the Washington Monument was covered with scaffolding, markedly altering its appearance;   Whereas although the Washington Monument was closed during rehabilitation, the 488 lights on the scaffolding of the monument illuminated the night sky of the United States capital and provided visitors and residents with a sight of unexpected beauty; and   Whereas the repair of the Washington Monument would not have been possible without the vision and dedication of the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]], contractors of the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]], and generous philanthropic support: Now, therefore, be it
