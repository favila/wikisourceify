{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Urging the P5+1 to only accept a final nuclear agreement with Iran that definitively prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, ceases Iran’s construction of advanced missiles and warheads, suspends Iran’s support for terrorist organizations, and reduces human rights violations within Iran.Whereas a nuclear-capable Iran threatens United States national security and global stability;Whereas since at least the late 1980s, Iran has engaged in a sustained and well-documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities to acquire a nuclear weapons capability;Whereas United States policy is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability;Whereas in November 2013, the P5+1 and Iran announced an interim nuclear agreement and the intent to reach a final comprehensive agreement over Iran’s nuclear program;Whereas the [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]] has adopted multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding of Iran its full and sustained suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and its full cooperation with the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) on all outstanding issues related to its nuclear activities, particularly those concerning the possible military dimensions of its nuclear programs;Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry has publicly stated that the United States does not recognize Iran’s self-proclaimed right to enrich uranium;Whereas the [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]] has adopted multiple resolutions demanding of Iran its full and sustained suspension of heavy-water production efforts, including the heavy-water reactor at Arak;Whereas Iran routinely denies international inspectors access to suspected nuclear and weapons-testing facilities in violation of international agreements, including the Parchin military complex;Whereas Iran is developing an arsenal of advanced long-range ballistic missiles, including some already capable of reaching India, North Africa, western China, and parts of eastern Europe, and is expected to be able to flight-test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the United States by 2015;Whereas, on June 9, 2010, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]] adopted Resolution 1929, which states that “Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” ;Whereas the [[w:United States Department of State|United States Department of State]] has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and has characterized Iran as the “most active state sponsor of terrorism” in the world;Whereas Iran is a world leader in human rights violations, including the persecution of religious minorities and imprisonment of United States citizens; andWhereas economic sanctions have brought Iran’s economy to the brink of collapse, forcing the Government of Iran to enter serious negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program: Now, therefore, be it
