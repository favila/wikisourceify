{{Center|A BILL}}

 To require Federal agencies to collaborate in the development of freely available open source educational materials in college-level physics, chemistry, and math, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Learning Opportunities With Creation of Open Source Textbooks (LOW COST) Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) According to the College Board, that the average student at a 4-year university spent an estimated $1,222 per year on college books and supplies.
:(2) According to the National Association of College Stores, the gross margin on new college textbooks was 25.6 percent in 2012.
:(3) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]has found that college textbook prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades and that new textbook prices increased 82 percent over the last decade.
:(4) An open source material project that would make high quality educational materials freely available to the general public would reduce college textbook costs and increase accessibility to such education materials.
:(5) College-level open source course work materials in math, physics, and chemistry represent a high-priority first step in this area.
:(6) The scientific and technical workforce at Federal agencies, national laboratories, and federally funded research and development centers could make a valuable contribution to this effort.
:(7) A Federal oversight role in the creation and maintenance of standard, publicly vetted textbooks is desirable to ensure that intellectual property is respected and that public standards for quality, educational effectiveness, and scientific accuracy are maintained. 

=Sec. 3. Open source material pilot program=



==(a) In general– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall begin development of college freshman-level, high quality, open source materials that—

:(2) are posted on the Federal Open Source Material Website; and
:(3) are free of copyright violations.

==(b) Posting deadline– ==

Not later than 4 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall have posted the materials described in subsection (a) on the Federal Open Source Material Website.

==(c) Screening procedures– ==

Before publishing materials on the Federal Open Source Material Website, the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall, in collaboration with the agencies described in section 5(b) , develop, implement, and establish procedures for checking the veracity, accuracy, and educational effectiveness of open source materials. 

=Sec. 4. Federal Open Source Material Website=



==(a) Establishment– ==

=Sec. 6. Regulations=

The [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall prescribe regulations necessary to implement this Act, including redistribution and attribution standards for open source materials produced under this Act. 

=Sec. 7. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Director– ==

The term“Director”means the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director of the National Science Foundation]].

==(3) High quality– ==

The term“high quality”means—
:(A) tested for optimal student engagement;
:(B) tested for optimal content consumption;
:(C) subjected to an editorial peer review process; and
