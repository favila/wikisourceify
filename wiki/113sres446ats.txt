{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 50thanniversary of the Congressional declaration of bourbon whiskey as a distinctive product of the United States.    Whereas on May 4, 1964, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]declared bourbon whiskey a distinctive product of the United States that is unlike other types of alcoholic beverages, whether foreign or domestic;   Whereas to be designated as“bourbon,”a product must conform to high standards and be manufactured in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States, which prescribe Federal Standards of Identity for“bourbon whisky”;   Whereas bourbon whiskey has achieved recognition and acceptance throughout the world as a distinctive product of the United States;   Whereas Kentucky, the birthplace of bourbon, produces 95 percent of the world’s supply;   Whereas Kentucky’s iconic bourbon brands are reaching farther than ever, with more than 30,000,000 gallons shipped to 126 countries, making bourbon the largest export category among all United States distilled spirits and a source of national pride;   Whereas bourbon production has increased by more than 120 percent since 1999, contributing to the development of a vibrant bourbon tourism industry in Kentucky;   Whereas bourbon is a vital part of American culture and the economy, generating close to 9,000 jobs in Kentucky and almost $2,000,000,000 in gross Kentucky product in 2010; and   Whereas the bourbon industry continues its efforts to promote the responsible and moderate use of its product, and to curb drunken driving and underage drinking: Now, therefore, be it    

= =
