{{Center|A BILL}}

To clarify that the anti-kickback laws apply to qualified health plans, the federally-facilitated marketplaces, and other plans and programs under title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “No Obamacare Kickbacks Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1)  Section 6402(f) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act([[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]] ]] )applies the civil penalties and damages for violations of the False Claims Actto kickbacks and other acts involving Federal health care programs that are subject to criminal penalties under section 1128B of the Social Security Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1320a–7b 42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b] ).
:(2) In guidance issued on November 4, 2013, by the [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight]] (CCIIO) of the [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services]] , the CCIIO stated that the “ [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) has broad authority to regulate the Federal and State Marketplaces (e.g. section 1321(a) of the Affordable Care Act)” . The November 4th statement from the [[w:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|CCIIO]] suggests that qualified health plans and other health care plans and programs established under title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Actare similar to other Federal health care programs, such as the Medicare Advantage program, over which the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] also has broad regulatory authority.
:(3) The private health insurance issuers who offer qualified health plans through marketplaces established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Actand the private health insurance issuers that offer Medicare Advantage plans under the Medicare program both receive Federal dollars directly from the Federal Government, with the issuers of qualified health plans receiving Federal dollars through tax credit subsidies and the issuers of Medicare Advantage plans receiving payments from the Medicare Trust Funds.
:(4) The Federal Government facilitates applications for and enrollment in qualified health plans through the federally-facilitated marketplaces and State exchanges in a similar manner to the way the Federal Government facilitates applications for and enrollment in plans under the Medicare Advantage program and the Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program through federally funded call centers, web portals, and consumer assistance personnel.
:(5) The Medicare Advantage program is a Federal health care program to which the anti-kickback provisions of section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Actand other prohibited acts involving Federal health care programs are subject to civil and criminal penalties under the Social Security Actas well as civil penalties under the False Claims Act.
