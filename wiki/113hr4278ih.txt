===(a) Findings– ===

This economic condition undermines democratic prospects in Ukraine.
:(2) Years of poor economic management and performance have undermined and may continue to undermine political stability and unity within Ukraine.
:(3) On March 6, 2014, the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]passed H.R. 4152 , to redirect previously appropriated funds to cover the cost of roughly $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine.

:(2) reducing the bloated public sector;
:(3) maintaining a market-determined exchange rate;
:(4) strengthening the vulnerable banking sector; and
:(5) reducing corruption.

:(3) The opinions and views of the Ukrainian people, especially those people located in the eastern regions and Crimea, are not being accurately represented in Russian dominated mass media.
:(4) Russian forces have seized more than five television stations in Crimea and taken over transmissions, switching to a 24/7 Russian propaganda format; this increase in programming augments the already robust pro-Russian programming to Ukraine.
