To establish an Office of Rural Education Policy in the Department of Education.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Office of Rural Education Policy Act”.

=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary of Education]] has recognized that“<nowiki>[r]ural schools have unique challenges and benefits</nowiki>”, but a recent report by the Rural School and Community Trust refers to the“paucity of rural education research in the United States”.
:(2) Rural education is becoming an increasingly large and important part of the United States public school system. According to the Digest of Education Statistics reported annually by the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]] , the number of students attending rural schools increased by more than 11 percent, from 10,500,000 to nearly 11,700,000, between the 2004–2005 and 2008–2009 school years. The share of the Nation’s public school enrollment attending rural schools increased from 21.6 percent to 23.8 percent. In school year 2008–2009, these students attended 31,635 rural schools, nearly one-third of all schools in the United States.
:(3) Despite the overall growth of rural education, rural students represent a demographic minority in all but 3 States, according to the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]] .
:(4) Rural education is becoming increasingly diverse. According to the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]] , the increase in rural enrollment between the 2004–2005 and 2008–2009 school years was disproportionally among students of color. Enrollment of children of color in rural schools increased by 31 percent, and the proportion of students enrolled in rural schools who are children of color increased from 23.0 to 26.5 percent. More than one-third of rural students in 12 States are children of color, according to research by the Rural School and Community Trust (Why Rural Matters 2009).
:(5) Rural education is varied and diverse across the Nation. In school year 2007–2008, the national average rate of student poverty in rural school districts, as measured by the rate of participation in federally subsidized meals programs, was 39.1 percent, but ranged from 9.7 percent in Connecticut to 71.9 percent in New Mexico, according to the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]] .
:(6) Even policy measures intended to help rural schools can have unintended consequences. In awarding competitive grants under the Investing in Innovation Fund program under section 14007 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009([[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-5|Public Law 111–5]] ]] ), the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary of Education]] attempted to encourage and support rural applicants by providing additional points for proposals to serve at least 1 rural local educational agency. But according to research by the Rural School and Community Trust (Taking Advantage, 2010), this rural preference mainly had the effect of inducing urban applicants to include rural participation merely in order to gain additional scoring points for primarily urban projects.
:(7) Rural schools generally utilize distance education more often for both students and teachers. A fall 2008 survey of public schools by the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]] found that rural schools were 1½ times more likely to provide students access for online distance learning than schools in cities. A September 2004 study from the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] reported that rural school districts used distance learning for teacher training more often than non-rural school districts.
:(8) The [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]] reports that base salaries of both the lowest and highest paid teachers are lower in rural schools than any other community type.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to establish an [[w:|Office of Rural Education Policy]] in the [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] ; and
:(2) to provide input to the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary of Education]] regarding the impact of proposed changes in law, regulations, policies, rules, and budgets on rural schools and communities.
