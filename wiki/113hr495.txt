{{section|HA6C07934423D4BD9A3FBC231F72E242B|2. Findings}}
The Congress finds the following:
(1)
The Internal
			 Revenue Service (IRS) Free File program as established by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] pursuant to
			 public rulemaking and set forth in the Federal Register, Vol. 67, No. 213,
			 Monday, November 4, 2002, pages 67247–67251, and in implementing agreements and
			 governing rules and requirements between the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the tax software and
			 electronic industry in 2002, 2005, and 2009, has been successful and
			 significant in the efforts of the Federal Government to increase the electronic
			 filing of individual income tax returns.

(2)
By the end of the
			 current tax return filing season around 40,000,000 Federal individual income
			 tax returns will have been prepared and filed electronically for free under the
			 IRS Free File program.

(3)
The IRS Free File
			 program offers Federal individual income tax return preparation and electronic
			 filing services to more than 70 percent of taxpayers, approximately 98,000,000
			 taxpayers at the end of the current tax filing period, at no cost to the
			 taxpayers or to the Federal Government from tax software and electronic filing
			 companies participating in the program, currently 16 companies.

(4)
By the end of the
			 current tax return filing season, it is estimated that the IRS Free File
			 program will have saved taxpayers approximately $1,110,000,000 and will have
			 saved the Federal Government hundreds of millions of dollars.

(5)
Under the IRS Free
			 File program, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the companies participating in the program have made
			 substantial improvements to the program to provide better products and services
			 to eligible taxpayers.

(6)
The IRS Free File
			 program must be maintained in order to reach and maintain Congress’ goal as set
			 forth in the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998
 of
			 having 80 percent of all Federal individual income tax returns filed
			 electronically.

(7)
The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the
			 participating tax preparation companies have integrated the IRS Free File
			 program with State tax systems to enable taxpayers to also file their State tax
			 returns in conjunction with their IRS Free File filings.

(8)
Twenty-two States
			 and the District of Columbia now operate a Free File program patterned after
			 the IRS Free File program again at no cost to the State taxpayers or the State
			 governments.

(9)
At the end of the
			 current tax return filing season, it is estimated that the Free File States
			 will have saved hundreds of millions of dollars collectively.
