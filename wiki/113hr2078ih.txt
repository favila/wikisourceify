:(2) the multi-agency report concludes that nearly one-third of the Nation’s 800 bird species are endangered, threatened, or in significant decline;
:(3) death from collisions with man-made structures is one of the most serious sources of avian mortality, and it is increasing;
:(4) not only are birds beautiful and interesting creatures that are eagerly welcomed by millions of Americans into their backyards every year, but birds also have an impact on the United States economy;
:(5) the [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] has reported that birdwatchers contribute $36 billion annually to the United States economy, and birds naturally provide billions of dollars worth of pest control, benefitting farmers and consumers alike;
:(6) the U.S. Green Building Council has added bird-friendly language to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Reference Guide, which will have the impact of recognizing bird-friendly design in awarding LEED credits;
:(7) bird-safe design features can be incorporated into new construction and major renovation projects at no extra cost, and existing buildings may be made bird-safe through the use of simple, low cost adaptations;
:(8) the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] is obligated, under Executive Order 13186, to “support the conservation intent of the migratory bird conventions by integrating bird conservation principles, measures, and practices into agency activities and by avoiding or minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse impacts on migratory bird resources when conducting agency actions” ; and
:(9) the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] has already constructed many award-winning, bird-friendly buildings, including the San Francisco Federal Building, the Suitland Census Complex, the United States courthouse in Eugene, Oregon, the Beltsville ATF Laboratory Center, and the United States courthouse in Buffalo, New York.
