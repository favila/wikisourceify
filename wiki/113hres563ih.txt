{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of May as“National Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month”.    Whereas 7,100,000, or 9.5 percent, of children in the United States currently have asthma, and that percentage has risen steadily since the 1980s;   Whereas 25,000,000, or 1 in 12, people in the United States have asthma, and the numbers are increasing each year;   Whereas on average, in 2008 children missed 4 days of school and adults missed 5 days of work because of asthma;   Whereas asthma is the most common noncommunicable disease among children;   Whereas 1,800,000 individuals per year visit emergency departments because of asthma’s effects;   Whereas asthma costs the United States about $3,300 in medical expenses per person with asthma each year from 2002 to 2007;   Whereas medical expenses associated with asthma increased from $48,600,000,000 in 2002 to $50,100,000,000 in 2007;   Whereas fewer than half of people with asthma report being taught how to avoid triggers, which are key to the prevention of asthma attacks;   Whereas asthma is a manageable disease; and   Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as“National Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month”: Now, therefore, be it
