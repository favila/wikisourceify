=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds that—
:(1) the existing Highway Trust Fund system is unsustainable and unable to meet our Nation’s 21st century transportation needs;
:(2)   MAP–21 included important reforms that must be built upon in the next reauthorization bill to increase the efficient and effective utilization of Federal funding;
:(3) these reforms should include the elimination of duplicative Federal regulations and increase the authority and responsibility of the States to safely and efficiently build, operate, and fund transportation systems that best serve the needs of their citizens, including the ability of each State to implement innovative solutions, while also maintaining the appropriate Federal role in transportation; and
:(4) Congress should enact and the President should sign a surface transportation reauthorization and reform bill prior to the expiration of this Act.
