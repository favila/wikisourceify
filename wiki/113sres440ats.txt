{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the contributions of teachers to the civic, cultural, and economic well-being of the United States.    Whereas education and knowledge are the foundation of the current and future strength of the United States;   Whereas teachers and other educators deserve the respect of their students and communities for their selfless dedication to community service and the future of the children of the United States;   Whereas the purpose of“National Teacher Day”, which will be observed on May 6, 2014, is to raise public awareness of the unquantifiable contributions teachers make to society and to promote greater respect and understanding for the teaching profession; and   Whereas students, schools, communities, and a number of organizations representing educators are hosting teacher appreciation events in recognition of National Teacher Day: Now, therefore, be it    

= =
