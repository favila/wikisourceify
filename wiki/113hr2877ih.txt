:(2) Levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may not be made under paragraph (1) .
:(3) Levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on natural gas pipeline property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.
:(4) Impose any other tax that discriminates against a natural gas pipeline providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]]. 

=Sec. 2. Jurisdiction of courts; relief=



==(a) Grant of Jurisdiction– ==

Notwithstanding[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1341  section 1341of title 28, United States Code], and notions of comity, and without regard to the amount in controversy or citizenship of the parties, the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, concurrent with other jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, of States, and of all other taxing authorities and taxing jurisdictions, to prevent a violation of section 1 .

==(b) Relief– ==

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, relief may be granted under this Act only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of natural gas pipeline property exceeds by at least 5 percent the ratio of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction. If the ratio of the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the assessment jurisdiction to the true market value of all other commercial and industrial property cannot be determined to the satisfaction of the court through the random-sampling method known as a sales assessment ratio study (to be carried out under statistical principles applicable to such a study), each of the following shall be a violation of section 1 for which relief under this Act may be granted:
:(1) An assessment of the natural gas pipeline property at a value that has a higher ratio of assessed value to the true market value of the natural gas pipeline property than the ratio of the assessed value of all other property (excluding public utility property) subject to a property tax levy in the assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of all other property (excluding public utility property).
:(2) The collection of an ad valorem property tax on the natural gas pipeline property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to all other taxable property (excluding public utility property) in the taxing jurisdiction.
