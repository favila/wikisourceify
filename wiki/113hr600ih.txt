=={{anchor|H1C14572C958A40D18E0B749089EDAF5E}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) ineffective wastewater treatment is one of the most common sources of water pollution;
:(2) nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading, continues to be one of the most significant water quality issues facing the Great Lakes System;
:(3) limiting phosphorus loads is key to controlling excessive algal growth, and a coordinated Great Lakes System-wide strategy to change how nutrients are discharged is urgent; and
:(4) nutrient removal technology is one of the most reliable, cost effective, and direct methods for reducing the flow of phosphorus and other harmful nutrients from point sources in the Great Lakes System.

=={{anchor|HB84351FDFC4C435087F57AAEDA523149}}(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to authorize the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] to provide financial assistance to Great Lakes States and municipalities for use in upgrading publically owned wastewater treatment plants in the Great Lakes System with nutrient removal technologies; and
:(2) to further the goal of restoring the water of the Great Lakes System to conditions that are protective of human health and aquatic life.
