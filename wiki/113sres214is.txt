{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week of October 13, 2013, through October 19, 2013, as“National Case Management Week”to recognize the value of case management in improving healthcare outcomes for patients.    Whereas case management is a collaborative process of assessment, education, planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy;   Whereas the goal of case management is to meet the health needs of the patient and the family of the patient, while respecting and assuring the right of the patient to self determination, through communication and available resources in order to promote quality, cost-effective outcomes;   Whereas case managers are advocates who help patients understand their current health status and ways to improve their health, and in this way serve as catalysts who guide patients and provide cohesion with other professionals in the healthcare delivery team;   Whereas case managers are an important link to quality healthcare;   Whereas the American Case Management Association and the Case Management Society of America work diligently to bring awareness to the broad range of services case managers offer and to educate providers, payers, and regulators on the improved patient outcomes that case management services can provide;   Whereas, through National Case Management Week, the American Case Management Association and the Case Management Society of America hope to continue to educate providers, payers, regulators, and consumers about the value case managers bring to the successful delivery of healthcare;   Whereas the American Case Management Association and the Case Management Society of America will celebrate National Case Management Week during the week of October 13, 2013, through October 19, 2013, in order to recognize case managers as an essential link to quality healthcare; and   Whereas it is appropriate at that time to recognize the many achievements of case managers in improving healthcare outcomes: Now, therefore, be it
