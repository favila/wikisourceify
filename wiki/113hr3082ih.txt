==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi first announced itself in February 2012. The group is led by Muhammad al-Zahawi, who had previously been an inmate of former President Muammar al-Qaddafi’s infamous Abu Salim prison.
:(2) On August 6, 2013, the Department of Justice filed sealed criminal charges against Ahmed Abu Khattalah, a senior commander within Libya’s Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Abu Khattalah was seen at the United States consulate in Benghazi during the September 11, 2012, attack that killed United States Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty.
:(3) On October 17, 2012, the New York Times reported that Libyan authorities named Ahmed Abu Khattalah as a commander in the September 11, 2012, attack on the United States consulate in Benghazi.
:(4) On August 8, 2013, the Washington Institute for Near East Peace issued a report in which it highlights Ansar al-Sharia’s establishment of training camps in Libya for jihadists preparing to fight with extremist rebels in Syria.
:(5) Abu Sufian Bin Qumu, leader of the Ansar al-Sharia faction in Darnah, Libya, is a former Guantanamo Bay inmate with close al-Qaeda ties. Bin Qumu was an associate of Usama bin Laden and is believed to maintain connections to senior al-Qaeda members.
:(6) According to a report published by the Library of Congress in August 2012, Ansar al-Sharia “has increasingly embodied al Qaeda’s presence in Libya, as indicated by its active social-media propaganda, extremist discourse, and hatred of the West, especially the United States” .
:(7) According to a report published by the Library of Congress in August 2012, al-Qaeda’s senior leadership in Pakistan has dispatched operatives to Libya to establish a clandestine terrorist network there. The report concluded that al-Qaeda is on the verge of a fully operational network inside Libya, and Ansar al-Sharia is one of the brands employed by al Qaeda operatives.
