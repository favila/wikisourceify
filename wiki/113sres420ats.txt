{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week of October 6 through October 12, 2014, as“Naturopathic Medicine Week”to recognize the value of naturopathic medicine in providing safe, effective, and affordable health care.    Whereas, in the United States, more than 75 percent of health care costs are due to preventable chronic illnesses, including high blood pressure, which affects 88,000,000 people in the United States, and diabetes, which affects 26,000,000 people in the United States;   Whereas nearly2/3of adults in the United States are overweight or obese and, consequently, at risk for serious health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and depression;   Whereas 70 percent of people in the United States experience physical or nonphysical symptoms of stress, and stress can contribute to the development of major illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, depression, and diabetes;   Whereas the aforementioned chronic health conditions are among the most common, costly, and preventable health conditions;   Whereas naturopathic medicine provides noninvasive, holistic treatments that support the inherent self-healing capacity of the human body and encourage self-responsibility in health care;   Whereas naturopathic medicine focuses on patient-centered care, the prevention of chronic illnesses, and early intervention in the treatment of chronic illnesses;   Whereas naturopathic physicians attend 4-year, graduate level programs that are accredited by agencies approved by the [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]];   Whereas aspects of naturopathic medicine have been shown to lower the risk of major illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes;   Whereas naturopathic physicians can help address the shortage of primary care providers in the United States;   Whereas naturopathic physicians are licensed in 20 States and territories;   Whereas naturopathic physicians are trained to refer patients to conventional physicians and specialists when necessary;   Whereas the profession of naturopathic medicine is dedicated to providing health care to underserved populations; and   Whereas naturopathic medicine provides consumers in the United States with more choice in health care, in line with the increased use of a variety of integrative medical treatments: Now, therefore, be it
