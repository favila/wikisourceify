			 Training Act”.

={{anchor|HC2D42093BA6948DEA4D8FE2988C8205E}}Sec. 2. Findings and
			 Purpose=



=={{anchor|HFA69395849DE44AE8C1CCC9F9CDA98C7}}(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act
			 of 1978 established an interim 5-year target of 3 percent unemployment for
			 individuals 20 years of age and older, and 4 percent for individuals age 16 and
			 over within 5 years, with full employment to be achieved as soon as
			 practicable thereafter.
:(2) The Federal
			 Government has previously established full employment as a national goal in
			 national legislation, including the Employment Act of 1946 and the Full
			 Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978.
:(3) Pursuant to these
			 Acts, the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] declared it is the continuing policy and responsibility of
			 the Federal Government to use all practicable means to create and maintain
			 conditions which promote useful employment opportunities for all who seek them,
			 including the self-employed. Pursuant to these Acts, the Congress declared and
			 established as a national goal the fulfillment of the right to full
			 opportunities for useful paid employment at fair rates of compensation of all
			 individuals able, willing, and seeking to work.
:(4) The Nation has
			 suffered substantial unemployment and underemployment, and idleness of
			 productive resources over prolonged periods of time, imposing numerous economic
			 and social costs on the Nation.
:(5) The Nation has
			 been deprived of the full supply of goods and services, the full utilization of
			 labor and capital resources, and the related increases in economic well-being
			 that would occur under conditions of genuine full employment.
:(6) The current output
			 of goods and services is insufficient to meet pressing national priorities for
			 infrastructure, transportation, energy, education, health care, child and elder
			 care, and many other necessary public and human services.
:(7) Unemployment and
			 underemployment expose many workers and families to significant, social,
			 psychological and physiological costs, including disruption of family life, the
			 loss of individual dignity and self-respect, and the aggravation of physical
			 and psychological illnesses.
:(8) Persisting
			 unemployment and underemployment have devastating financial consequences,
			 resulting in the loss of income and spending power for families, and
			 interfering with their ability to save and accumulate assets for a secure
			 family life and retirement. High levels of unemployment and inadequate consumer
			 demand also contribute to poor conditions for retail businesses, manufacturers
			 and many other firms to grow and prosper. In the real estate sector, the
			 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that continuing high levels of unemployment contribute to
			 foreclosures, evictions, and commercial vacancies, undermining the quality of
			 neighborhood and community life, and hampering prospects for economic recovery
			 and national prosperity.
:(9) The historic
			 promise of this earlier legislation has not been fully realized, and we
			 re-declare and reaffirm our support for achieving a national goal of jobs for
			 all at living wages.
:(10) The United States has a duty under Articles
			 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter to promote “full employment” and the
			 “universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental
			 freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion”.
			 The human rights the United States has a duty to promote pursuant to this
			 obligation are set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article
			 23 of the Universal Declaration states that “Everyone has the right to work”
			 and to “just and favorable remuneration” that insures for his or her family “an
			 existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other
			 means of social protection”.
:(11) The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has
			 a strong interest in seeking the progressive reduction and elimination of job
			 disparities among groups of workers who experience chronically higher rates of
			 unemployment and underemployment.
:(12) Even at the top of the business cycle, when
			 national unemployment rates drop to the 4 percent to 5 percent range, job
			 vacancy surveys show that the economy does not provide enough jobs to employ
			 everyone who wants to work. Reliance on direct job creation to close the
			 economy’s job gap is especially important at such times, because it provides a
			 means of creating additional jobs without adding significantly to inflationary
			 pressures, a very difficult goal to achieve at the top of the business cycle
			 via macroeconomic policy interventions.
:(13) The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]
			 intends to maximize the creation of private, public and nonprofit sector jobs
			 through improved use of general economic and structural policies, including
			 measures to encourage private sector investment and capital formation; an
			 increased public investment in research and development, infrastructure,
			 energy, education, public services and the environment, and other essential
			 goods and services.

=={{anchor|HEF12583024C0470DAFD600540050021D}}(b) Purpose– ==

It
			 is the purpose of the Humphrey Hawkins 21st Century Full Employment and
			 Training Act to expedite progress to fulfill the right to useful work at living
			 wages for all persons seeking employment, as promptly as possible and at the
			 earliest practicable date by establishing a Full Employment Trust Fund to fund
			 and operate a national program of public service employment and to provide
			 additional labor market opportunities to complement those offered by the
			 existing private, public, and nonprofit sectors.
