{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Affirming the importance of the Taiwan Relations Act.    Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act has been instrumental in maintaining peace, security, and stability in the Taiwan Strait since its enactment in 1979, and it is in the political, international and economic interests of the United States;   Whereas when the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted, it affirmed that the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China was based on the expectation that the future of Taiwan would be determined by peaceful means;   Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states that it is the policy of the United States to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan;   Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act also states that“it is the policy of the United States to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural and other relations between the people on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China mainland”;   Whereas the relationship between the United States and Taiwan has been strengthened with— 
:(1) Taiwan’s evolution into a free society and a full-fledged, multi-party democracy; 
:(2) the development of Taiwan’s robust market economy; 
:(3) Taiwan’s determined effort and collaboration with the United States to combat global terrorism, as demonstrated in part by its participation in the Container Security Initiative; and 
:(4) the leadership role Taiwan has demonstrated in addressing transnational and global challenges, including its active engagement in humanitarian relief measures, public health endeavors, environmental protection initiatives, and financial market stabilization efforts;   Whereas the United States is the third largest trading partner and the largest investor in Taiwan, while Taiwan is the eleventh largest trading partner of the United States and the sixth largest United States agricultural market;   Whereas Taiwan’s democracy has deepened with the second peaceful transfer of power from one political party to another after the Presidential election in March 2008; and   Whereas the United States and Taiwan are united in our shared values in fair elections, personal liberty, and free enterprise: Now, therefore, be it
