To assure quality and best value with respect to Federal construction projects by prohibiting the practice known as bid shopping.

={{anchor|H365C4A2523004F039BD15DF532089BC6}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Construction Quality Assurance Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H151F72D4BD064153B82F05015AAB50D6}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Federal construction project sealed bid contractor selection procedure is a valuable project acquisition method that should be preserved and strengthened for projects of appropriate scope.
:(2) Federal procurement data trends indicate that agencies increasingly are relying on other negotiated contractor selection procedures, rather than price-only selection procedures.
:(3) Requirements for Federal agencies to use major subcontractor bid listing on price-only prime contractor selection procedures would restore the balance in use of low-bid and competitive negotiations, which has proven results in other public procurement systems.
:(4) Bid shopping occurs when the successful prime contract low bidder, after project award, uses the successful subcontract low bids as the beginning point for a post-award auction to the same or other subcontractors to agree to perform the subcontract work at an even lower price, with the savings accruing only to the benefit of the low-bid prime contractor, not the agency program, the project, or the taxpayer.
:(5) Bid peddling occurs when other subcontractors approach the successful prime contractor bidder after award of the prime contract and offer to perform the subcontract work at a lower price than submitted by the subcontractor whose sub-bid price was relied on by the successful prime contractor, again with the ostensible savings accruing to the prime contract low bidder only, not the agency program, the project, or the taxpayers.
:(6) Listing of major subcontract bids in the prime contractor’s sealed bid by agencies will effectively stem the detrimental and inequitable practices of bid shopping and bid peddling on direct Federal construction contracts that are detrimental to the taxpayers’ interest in Government procurement trans­par­en­cy, sound public contract administration, and successful construction project completion.
:(7) Agencies will receive better project performance, by restoring integrity to the low-bid selection system for both prime contractors and major subcontractors, as abusive selection procedures often lead to greater project disputes, claims, changes, product and material substitutions, and in some cases even contractor defaults—again, all to the detriment of the agency program, the project, and the taxpayers generally.
:(8) Restoring equitable safeguards in the low-bid system will assure that agency practice will conform to the highest standards adhered to by industry professionals and contractor associations, and will reflect best practices followed by a great many other public procurement systems nationally and internationally.
