{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide assistance to Ukraine to reduce the dependence of Ukraine on imports of natural gas from the Russian Federation, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Ukrainian Independence from Russian Energy Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) Ukraine is dependent on natural gas supplies from the Russian Federation to meet more than half of demand in Ukraine.
:(2) Entities owned by the Government of the Russian Federation have manipulated natural gas supplies and prices in Ukraine in order to gain geopolitical leverage over Ukraine and neighboring countries of Ukraine.
:(3) Energy subsidies provided by the Government of Ukraine amount to roughly 8 percent of the gross domestic product of Ukraine and make energy markets opaque, inefficient, and susceptible to corruption.
:(4) Ukraine is the second-least energy efficient country in the world.
:(5) The International Energy Agency has estimated that if the economy of Ukraine were as energy efficient as the average country in Europe, Ukraine would reduce natural gas consumption by greater than 50 percent.
:(6) The level of savings from the reduction described in paragraph (6) could nearly eliminate the dependence of Ukraine on imports of natural gas from the Russian Federation.
:(7) The [[w:International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|World Bank Group]]has estimated that Ukraine could reduce the amount of natural gas used for heating by 50 percent through efficiency measures.
:(8) On April 25, 2014, a coalition of 35 cities in Ukraine sent a letter urgently requesting assistance in increasing the energy efficiency of their buildings, district heating systems, and transportation networks in order to reduce dependence on imports of natural gas from the Russian Federation.
:(9) A $17,000,000,000 loan package from the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]]to help stabilize the economy of Ukraine requires reforms of energy markets in Ukraine and includes provisions to gradually eliminate energy subsidies, which will raise retail natural gas rates by 56 percent in 2014, 40 percent in 2015, and 20 percent in 2016 and 2017.
:(10) Absent large reductions in energy consumption, the rate increases mandated by the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]]loan package from the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]]could have devastating impacts on low-income households in Ukraine.
:(11) Ukraine is estimated to have significant conventional and unconventional oil and gas reserves, which are mostly untapped.
:(12) The International Energy Agency has estimated that Ukraine possesses natural gas reserves of approximately 5,400,000,000,000 cubic meters, although the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation may impact Ukraine’s recoverable oil and gas reserves.
:(13) Exports of liquefied natural gas from the United States to Ukraine would not provide assistance for Ukraine in the short term and would be unlikely to reach Ukraine in the long term because—
::(A) of natural gas global market dynamics;
::(B) there are no liquefied natural gas import facilities in Ukraine; and
::(C) the Government of Turkey has indicated it would block shipments of liquefied natural gas through the Bosphorus Strait because of safety concerns. 

=Sec. 3. Policy on supporting energy independence of Ukraine=

It is the policy of the United States to use all resources of the United States Government—
:(1) to coordinate with multi-donor efforts to reform energy subsidies provided by the Government of Ukraine and energy markets in Ukraine;
:(2) to encourage private sector investment in the energy sector of Ukraine;
:(3) to protect low-income households in Ukraine from dramatic increases in energy rates;
:(4) to increase transparency and reduce corruption in the energy sector of Ukraine;
:(5) to improve energy efficiency, increase domestic energy supplies, and develop alternative sources of energy in Ukraine in order to reduce the reliance of Ukraine on energy from the Russian Federation; and
:(6) to increase the capacity of agencies of the Government of Ukraine, nongovernmental organizations, and private entities to administer and manage energy efficiency and energy security-related projects in Ukraine.
