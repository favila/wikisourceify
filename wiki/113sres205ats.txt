{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing support for the designation of September 2013 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers;Whereas ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States;Whereas, in 2013, approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed, and 14,400 women will die of ovarian cancer in the United States;Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not significantly decreased since the ‘‘War on Cancer’’ was declared more than 40 years ago;Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a family history that puts them at a higher risk;Whereas some women, such as those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, are at higher risk for developing the disease;Whereas the Pap test is sensitive and specific to the early detection of cervical cancer, but not ovarian cancer;Whereas there is currently no reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer;Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary symptoms, and several other symptoms that are easily confused with other diseases;Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to provide consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier for women to learn and remember the symptoms;Whereas there are known methods to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, including prophylactic surgery, oral contraceptives, and breastfeeding;Whereas due to the lack of a reliable early detection test, 75 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected at an advanced stage, making the overall 5-year survival rate only 46 percent;Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk for ovarian cancer and that play an important role in the prevention of the disease;Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by women and health care providers can lead to a quicker diagnosis;Whereas, each year during the month of September, the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance and its partner members hold a number of events to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer; andWhereas September 2013 should be designated as ‘‘National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month’’ to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it
