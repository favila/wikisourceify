=====(B) Protection of older, longer service participants– =====


:(i) A defined benefit plan that provides benefits, rights, or features to a closed class of participants shall not fail to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by reason of the composition of such closed class or the benefits, rights, or features provided to such closed class, if—
::(I) such closed class and such benefits, rights, and features satisfied the requirements of subparagraph (A) (without regard to this clause) as of the date that the class was closed, and
::(II) after the date as of which the class was closed, any plan amendments that modify the closed class or the benefits, rights, and features provided to such closed class satisfy subparagraph (A) (without regard to this clause).If a plan amendment is adopted that does not meet the requirements of subclause (II), the plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph if such plan satisfied such requirements (without regard to subclause (II)) as of the effective date of such amendment. In such cases, subclauses (I) and (II) shall subsequently be applied by reference to the effective date of the plan amendment, rather than by reference to the date that the class was closed.

In such cases, subclauses (II) and (III) shall subsequently be applied by reference to the effective date of the plan amendment, rather than by reference to the date that the class was closed.
