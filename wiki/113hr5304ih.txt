Congress finds the following:

:(3) Untreated hearing and balance problems contribute to and are highly correlated with depression and social isolation.
:(4) Seniors with hearing loss run a much higher risk of cognitive problems and experience cognitive decline up to 40 percent faster than those with normal hearing.
:(5) Medicare beneficiaries should have access to the same level of audiologic care as is available in the Veterans’ Administration, under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and under private insurance.
:(6) The Medicare program needs to be updated in a comprehensive way so Medicare beneficiaries are able to have access to all of the advancements in the delivery of audiologic care.
