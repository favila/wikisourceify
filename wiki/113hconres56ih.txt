{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of Congress that a certain lock and dam should be known and designated as the Donald G. Waldon Lock and Dam .    Whereas the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority is a 4-State compact comprised of the States of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee;   Whereas the Tennessee-Tombigbee Authority is the regional non-Federal sponsor of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway;   Whereas the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, completed in 1984, has fueled growth in the United States economy by reducing transportation costs and encouraging economic development; and   Whereas the selfless determination and tireless work of Donald G. Waldon, while serving as administrator of the waterway compact for 21 years, contributed greatly to the realization and success of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway: Now, therefore, be it    

= =
