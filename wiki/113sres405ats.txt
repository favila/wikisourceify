{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for the designation of the week of March 31 through April 4, 2014, as“National Assistant Principals Week”.    Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) and the National Association of Elementary School Principals have designated the week of March 31 through April 4, 2014, as“National Assistant Principals Week”;   Whereas an assistant principal, as a member of the school administration, interacts with many sectors of the school community, including support staff, instructional staff, students, and parents;   Whereas assistant principals are responsible for establishing a positive learning environment and building strong relationships between school and community;   Whereas assistant principals play a pivotal role in the instructional leadership of their schools by supervising student instruction, mentoring teachers, recognizing the achievements of staff, encouraging collaboration among staff, ensuring the implementation of best practices, monitoring student achievement and progress, facilitating and modeling data-driven decision-making to inform instruction, and guiding the direction of targeted intervention and school improvement;   Whereas the day-to-day logistical operations of schools require assistant principals to monitor and address facility needs, attendance, transportation issues, and scheduling challenges, as well as supervise extra- and co-curricular events;   Whereas assistant principals are entrusted with maintaining an inviting, safe, and orderly school environment that supports the growth and achievement of each and every student by nurturing positive peer relationships, recognizing student achievement, mediating conflicts, analyzing behavior patterns, providing interventions, and, when necessary, taking disciplinary actions;   Whereas since its establishment in 2004, the NASSP/Virco National Assistant Principal of the Year Program recognizes outstanding middle and high school assistant principals who demonstrate success in leadership, curriculum, and personalization; and   Whereas the week of March 31 through April 4, 2014, is an appropriate week to designate as National Assistant Principals Week: Now, therefore, be it
