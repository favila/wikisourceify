{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 to authorize concurrent compacts for purposes of regional economic integration and cross-border collaborations, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Millennium Compacts for Regional Economic Integration Act   ”or“ M–CORE Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) For more than a decade, six of the world’s 10 fastest growing economies are located in sub-Saharan Africa.
:(2) Many African nations are landlocked and their economies are isolated and will require greater support to benefit from regional integration of markets, infrastructure, and trade promotion type policies.
:(3) By connecting isolated African economies, there exists the potential to increase investment opportunities and support market-based growth.
:(4) While the African continent has experienced positive economic growth trends, successfully addressing the continent's infrastructure gaps could increase gross domestic product growth by an estimated two percent.
:(5) In recent years, the [[w:International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|World Bank]]has doubled its investment in African regional integration from $1.8 billion to $3.6 billion for projects to address infrastructure deficiencies, unemployment, and poverty reduction.
:(6) African nations, including regional economic bodies, have increasingly realized that a key driver to economic growth must involve greater cross-border collaboration and regional economic integration to address deficiencies in areas such as communications, transport, and energy networks.
:(7) The [[w:|Millennium Challenge Corporation]]’s compacts have increased access to reliable power, enhanced highway corridors, and upgraded regional trading hubs, thereby promoting economic growth and cross-border engagement between and among African nations. 

=Sec. 3. Purpose=

This purpose of this Act is to expand the [[w:|Millennium Challenge Corporation]]’s ability to develop compacts with nations, particularly in Africa, that promote regional economic integration and cross-border collaborations. 

=Sec. 4. Millennium Challenge Compact=
