{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the month of June 2014 as“National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month”.    Whereas the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, who proudly serve the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom of the people of the United States, and deserve the investment of every possible resource to ensure their lasting physical, mental, and emotional well-being;   Whereas more than 2,600,000 members of the Armed Forces have deployed overseas since the events of September 11, 2001, and have served in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq;   Whereas the Armed Forces of the United States have sustained a historically high operational tempo since September 11, 2001, with many members of the Armed Forces deploying overseas multiple times, placing those members at high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this preamble as“PTSD”);   Whereas members of the Armed Forces and veterans who served before September 11, 2001, remain at risk for PTSD and other mental health disorders;   Whereas the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]]reports that— 
:(1) since October 2001, more than 310,000 of the approximately 1,000,000 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn who have received health care from the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]have been diagnosed with PTSD; 
:(2) in fiscal year 2013, more than 530,000 of the nearly 6,000,000 veterans who sought care at [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]medical facilities received treatment for PTSD; and 
:(3) of veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn who are receiving health care from the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]], more than 570,000 have received a diagnosis for at least 1 mental health disorder;   Whereas many cases of PTSD remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated due to a lack of awareness about PTSD and the persistent stigma associated with mental health conditions;   Whereas exposure to military sexual trauma can lead to PTSD;   Whereas PTSD significantly increases the risk of anxiety, depression, suicide, homelessness, and drug- and alcohol-related disorders and deaths, especially if left untreated;   Whereas public perceptions of PTSD or other mental health disorders create unique challenges for veterans seeking employment;   Whereas the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]and the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]—as well as the larger medical community, both private and public—have made significant advances in the identification, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD and the symptoms of PTSD, but many challenges remain;   Whereas increased understanding of PTSD can help diminish the stigma attached to this mental health disorder, and additional efforts are needed to find further ways—including an examination of how PTSD is discussed in the United States—to reduce this stigma; and   Whereas the designation of a National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month will raise public awareness about issues related to PTSD, reduce the stigma associated with PTSD, and help ensure that those suffering from the invisible wounds of war receive proper treatment: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]—
:(1) designates June 2014, as“National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month”;
:(2) supports the efforts of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]]and the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]—as well as the entire medical community—to educate members of the Armed Forces, veterans, the families of members of the Armed Forces and veterans, and the public about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder; and
:(3) respectfully requests that the [[w:United States Senate|Secretary of the Senate]]transmit a copy of this resolution to the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]]and the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].
