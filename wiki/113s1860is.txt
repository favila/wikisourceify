==Title I— MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM==



==Sec. 101. Encouraging speedy resolution of claims==

The time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the following—
:(1) upon proof of fraud;
:(2) intentional concealment; or
:(3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the body of the injured person.Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a minor under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of manifestation of injury or prior to the minor’s 8th birthday, whichever provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a health care provider or health care organization have committed fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured minor.

==Sec. 102. Compensating patient injury==



===(a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in Health Care Lawsuits– ===

In any health care lawsuit, nothing in this title shall limit a claimant’s recovery of the full amount of the available economic damages, notwithstanding the limitation in  subsection (b)  .

===(b) Additional Noneconomic Damages– ===

In any health care lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, shall not exceed $250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with respect to the same injury.

===(c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages– ===

For purposes of applying the limitation in  subsection (b)  , future noneconomic damages shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not be informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. An award for noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting for any other reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards are rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be reduced first.

===(d) Fair Share Rule– ===

In any health care lawsuit, each party shall be liable for that party’s several share of any damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party’s percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant’s harm.

==Sec. 103. Maximizing patient recovery==



===(a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to Claimants– ===

In any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant’s damage recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits:
:(1) 40 percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the claimants.
:(2) 331/3percent of the next $50,000 recovered by the claimants.
:(3) 25 percent of the next $500,000 recovered by the claimants.
:(4) 15 percent of any amount by which the recovery by the claimants is in excess of $600,000.

===(b) Applicability– ===

The limitations in this section shall apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court supervision in the first two sentences of  subsection (a)  applies only in civil actions.

==Sec. 104. Additional collateral source benefits==

In any health care lawsuit involving injury or wrongful death, any party may introduce evidence of collateral source benefits. If a party elects to introduce such evidence, any opposing party may introduce evidence of any amount paid or contributed or reasonably likely to be paid or contributed in the future by or on behalf of the opposing party to secure the right to such collateral source benefits. No provider of collateral source benefits shall recover any amount against the claimant or receive any lien or credit against the claimant’s recovery or be equitably or legally subrogated to the right of the claimant in a health care lawsuit involving injury or wrongful death. This section shall apply to any health care lawsuit that is settled as well as a health care lawsuit that is resolved by a fact finder. This section shall not apply to  section 1862(b) ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395y 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)] )or  section 1902(a)(25) ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396a 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)]) of theSocial Security Act .

==Sec. 105. Punitive damages==



===(a) In General– ===

Punitive damages may, if otherwise permitted by applicable State or Federal law, be awarded against any person in a health care lawsuit only if it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that such person acted with malicious intent to injure the claimant, or that such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain to suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory damages is rendered against such person, no punitive damages may be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit. No demand for punitive damages shall be included in a health care lawsuit as initially filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the claim for punitive damages. At the request of any party in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a separate proceeding—
:(1) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the amount of such award; and
:(2) the amount of punitive damages following a determination of punitive liability.If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.

===(b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages– ===



====(1) Factors considered– ====

In determining the amount of punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider only the following—
:(A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such party;
:(B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by such party;
:(C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;
:(D) the number of products sold or medical procedures rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;
:(E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and
:(F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such party as a result of the conduct complained of by the claimant.

====(2) Maximum award– ====

The amount of punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit may not exceed $250,000 or two times the amount of economic damages awarded, whichever is greater. The jury shall not be informed of this limitation.

===(c) No Punitive Damages for Products That Comply With FDA Standards– ===



====(1) In general– ====


:(A) No punitive damages may be awarded against the manufacturer or distributor of a medical product, or a supplier of any component or raw material of such medical product, based on a claim that such product caused the claimant’s harm where—
::(i) 
:::(I) such medical product was subject to premarket approval, clearance, or licensure by the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] with respect to the safety of the formulation or performance of the aspect of such medical product which caused the claimant’s harm or the adequacy of the packaging or labeling of such medical product; and
:::(II) such medical product was so approved, cleared, or licensed; or
::(ii) such medical product is generally recognized among qualified experts as safe and effective pursuant to conditions established by the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] and applicable [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] regulations, including without limitation those related to packaging and labeling, unless the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] has determined that such medical product was not manufactured or distributed in substantial compliance with applicable [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] statutes and regulations.

=====(B) Rule of construction– =====

   Subparagraph (A)  may not be construed as establishing the obligation of the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] to demonstrate affirmatively that a manufacturer, distributor, or supplier referred to in such subparagraph meets any of the conditions described in such subparagraph.

====(2) Liability of health care providers– ====

A health care provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared by the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] shall not be named as a party to a product liability lawsuit involving such product and shall not be liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such product. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a court from consolidating cases involving health care providers and cases involving products liability claims against the manufacturer, distributor, or product seller of such medical product.

====(3) Packaging– ====

In a health care lawsuit for harm which is alleged to relate to the adequacy of the packaging or labeling of a drug which is required to have tamper-resistant packaging under regulations of the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (including labeling regulations related to such packaging), the manufacturer or product seller of the drug shall not be held liable for punitive damages unless such packaging or labeling is found by the trier of fact by clear and convincing evidence to be substantially out of compliance with such regulations.

====(4) Exception– ====

   Paragraph (1)  shall not apply in any health care lawsuit in which—
:(A) a person, before or after premarket approval, clearance, or licensure of such medical product, knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] information that is required to be submitted under the   Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/301 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq].)or  section 351 of thePublic Health Service Act  ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/262 42 U.S.C. 262] )that is material and is causally related to the harm which the claimant allegedly suffered; or
:(B) a person made an illegal payment to an official of the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] for the purpose of either securing or maintaining approval, clearance, or licensure of such medical product.

==Sec. 106. Authorization of payment of future damages to claimants in health care lawsuits==



===(a) In General– ===

In any health care lawsuit, if an award of future damages, without reduction to present value, equaling or exceeding $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund a periodic payment of such a judgment, the court shall, at the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by periodic payments. In any health care lawsuit, the court may be guided by the Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.

===(b) Applicability– ===

This section applies to all actions which have not been first set for trial or retrial before the effective date of this Act.

==Sec. 107. Effect on other laws==



===(a) Vaccine Injury– ===


:(1) To the extent that title XXI of thePublic Health Service Act  establishes a Federal rule of law applicable to a civil action brought for a vaccine-related injury or death—

::(B) any rule of law prescribed by this title in conflict with a rule of law of such title XXI shall not apply to such action.
:(2) If there is an aspect of a civil action brought for a vaccine-related injury or death to which a Federal rule of law under title XXI of thePublic Health Service Act  does not apply, then this title or otherwise applicable law (as determined under this title) will apply to such aspect of such action.

===(b) Other Federal Law– ===

Except as provided in this section, nothing in this title shall be deemed to affect any defense available to a defendant in a health care lawsuit or action under any other provision of Federal law.

===(b) Protection of States’ Rights and Other Laws– ===


:(1) Any issue that is not governed by any provision of law established by or under this title (including State standards of negligence) shall be governed by otherwise applicable State or Federal law.
