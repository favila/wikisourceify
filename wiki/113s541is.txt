[[w:|Ms. Landrieu]] (for herself and
[[w:|Mr. Graham]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To prevent human health threats posed by the consumption of equines raised in the United States.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Safeguard American Food Exports Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) unlike cows, pigs, and other domesticated species, horses and other members of the equidae family are not raised for the purpose of human consumption;
:(2) equines raised in the United States are frequently treated with substances that are not approved for use in horses intended for human consumption and equine parts are therefore unsafe within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
:(3) equines raised in the United States are frequently treated with drugs, including phen­yl­bu­ta­zone, acepromazine, boldenone un­dec­y­len­ate, omep­ra­zole, ketoprofen, xy­la­zine, hy­al­uron­ic acid, ni­tro­fu­ra­zone, polysulfated gly­cos­ami­no­gly­can, clenbuterol, tolazoline, and ponazuril, which are not approved for use in horses intended for human consumption and equine parts are therefore unsafe within the meaning of section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and
:(4) consuming parts of an equine raised in the United States likely poses a serious threat to human health and the public should be protected from these unsafe products.

=Sec. 3. Prohibitions=

 Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/331 21 U.S.C. 331] ] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>
:(ccc) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section—
::(1) equine parts shall be deemed unsafe under section 409 of this Act;
::(2) equine parts shall be deemed unsafe under section 512 of this Act; and
::(3) the knowing sale or transport of equines or equine parts in interstate or foreign commerce for purposes of human consumption is hereby prohibited..
