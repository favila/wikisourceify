{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Honoring Thomas Jennings of New York City as the first African-American to be granted a patent by the United States.    Whereas Thomas Jennings was born a free African-American in New York City in 1791 and became a successful tailor with a shop on Church Street in New York City;   Whereas Thomas Jennings invented a cleaning process called dry scouring , which was the precursor to dry cleaning;   Whereas, on March 3, 1821, Thomas Jennings became the first African-American to be granted a patent by the United States for his cleaning process;   Whereas, before the Civil War, patent laws made it significantly hard, if not impossible, for slaves to hold a patent, but Thomas Jennings was able to obtain a patent because of his free status; and   Whereas Thomas Jennings utilized the earnings from his invention and business to help advance civil rights for African-Americans and to advocate for the abolition of slavery: Now, therefore, be it
