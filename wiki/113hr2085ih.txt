===(1) Clarifying factors for rate-setting– ===

In determining the payment amount under gapfilling procedures (as described insection 414.508(b)of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation to such section) for new clinical diagnostic laboratory tests under section 1833(h)(8) of the Social Security Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395l 42 U.S.C. 1395l(h)(8)] ), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (in this section referred to as the Secretary ) shall take into account, as applicable and available, the following factors with respect to such a new test:

====(A) Impact on patient care– ====

The impact of the new test on patient care, patient management, or patient treatment.

====(B) Technical characteristics– ====

The technical characteristics of the new test, and the resources required to develop, validate, and perform the new test.

Data from claims for which payment is made under part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act.

====(D) Laboratory charges– ====

Amounts charged by laboratories to self-pay patients for the new test.

====(A) Requirement for independent advisory panel– ====

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall convene an independent advisory panel from which the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall request information and recommendations regarding any new test (as referred to under subparagraph (A)of section 1833(h)(8) of the Social Security Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395l 42 U.S.C. 1395l(h)(8)] )) for which payment is made under such section, including technical, clinical, and quality information.

====(B) Composition of independent advisory panel– ====

Subject to subparagraph (D), the independent advisory panel shall be comprised of 19 members, including—
:(i) 7 individuals with expertise and experience with clinical diagnostic laboratory tests including expertise in the technical characteristics of the new test as well as expertise in the requirements to develop, validate, and perform the new test;
:(ii) 3 representatives of patients, including a patient representative for rare disorders;
:(iii) 3 clinicians who use results of the new test in patient care;
:(iv) 2 laboratorians;
:(v) 2 individuals with expertise in the area of pharmacoeconomics or health technology assessment; and

====(A) Initial justification– ====

With respect to decisions regarding payments made under the clinical laboratory fee schedule for new clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall publicly provide a justification for the payment basis and payment rate determination, including a detailed summary of the information submitted to, or obtained by, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] regarding the factors specified in paragraph (1), such that interested stakeholders can readily understand the Secretary’s rationale for the payment basis and rate determinations.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as authorizing the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] to reveal proprietary information which is otherwise prohibited from disclosure under law.

==(b) Process for assignment of temporary codes for diagnostic tests– ==

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall establish a process for application for the assignment of a temporary national HCPCS code to uniquely identify a diagnostic test until a permanent national HCPCS code is available for assignment to that test. Assignments of a temporary national HCPCS code shall occur on a quarterly basis. The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall provide public notice through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Web site of applications made for such temporary national HCPCS codes. Upon assignment of a temporary code under this process, the Secretary shall treat such test as a new test for purposes of section 1833(h)(8) of the Social Security Act.

==(c) Development of further improvements in rate-Setting processes– ==

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall analyze the process used for the gapfilling procedure used in determining payment amounts for new clinical diagnostic laboratory tests under section 1833(h)(8) of the Social Security Act.

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall examine what and how many entities should perform gapfilling, under contract or otherwise, and how to ensure that the process is informed by appropriate expertise and proceeds in a transparent and accountable manner. The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall implement improvements in the process, insofar as these are possible under the law through regulations, after public notice and opportunity for comment. For changes the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines would require a change in law, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall transmit recommendations to the [[w:United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the [[w:United States Senate|President of the Senate]] not later than July 1, 2014.
