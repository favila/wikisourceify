This Act may be cited as the“Health Outcomes, Planning, and Education for Alzheimer’s Act”.

=={{anchor|H3DD46510ADBD4CF8BB6C4E75A2DA69F4}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) As many as half of the estimated 5.2 million Americans with Alzheimer’s disease have never received a diagnosis.
:(2) An early and documented diagnosis and access to care planning services leads to better outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias and their caregivers.
:(3) Combining the existing Medicare benefits of a diagnostic evaluation and care planning into a single package of services would help ensure that individuals receive an appropriate diagnosis as well as critical information about the disease and available care options, which leads to better outcomes.
:(4) An accurate diagnosis allows for better management of other known chronic conditions and more efficient utilization of medical resources, including reducing complications and the number of costly emergency room visits and hospitalizations.
:(5) A formal diagnosis allows individuals and their caregivers to have access to available medical and non-medical treatments, build a care team, participate in support services, and enroll in clinical trials.
:(6) Undertaking the diagnostic process potentially allows cognitive impairment to be reversed, as the cognitive impairment of nine percent of individuals experiencing dementia-like symptoms is due to a potentially reversible cause, such as depression or vitamin deficiency.

The purpose of this Act is to increase diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, leading to better care and outcomes for Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
