 To delay implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Lower Electric Bill Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds the following:
:(1) Certain [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]environmental regulations are issued without any economic impact analysis that takes into consideration the costs to comply with such regulations and the impact of such regulations on the local economy and jobs.
:(2) Certain [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]environmental regulations are issued without any analysis of the feasibility of compliance with deadlines.
:(3) It will cost local communities billions of dollars to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.
:(4) Communities throughout the Nation will therefore face large increases in their electric utility bills, on top of rising water and wastewater bills, and in some cases these increases in electricity bills could be nearly 20 percent.
:(5) The economic impact of such Standards has the potential to be devastating, especially in communities with a high percentage of residents living at or below the poverty line, a factor which is not considered in cost/benefit analyses.
:(6) Higher energy costs also threaten all types of businesses, including manufacturing and other industries that employ thousands throughout the Nation.
