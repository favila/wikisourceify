{{Center|A BILL}}

To prohibit the sale or transport of equines and equine parts in interstate or foreign commerce for human consumption.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Safeguard American Food Exports Act of 2013”.

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) horses and other equines are domestic animals that are used primarily for recreation, pleasure, and sport;
:(2) unlike cows, pigs, and other domesticated species, horses and other members of the equidae family are not raised for the purpose of human consumption;
:(3) equines raised in the United States are frequently treated with drugs, including phen­yl­bu­ta­zone, acepromazine, boldenone un­dec­y­len­ate, omep­ra­zole, ketoprofen, xy­la­zine, hy­al­uron­ic acid, ni­tro­fu­ra­zone, polysulfated gly­cos­ami­no­gly­can, clenbuterol, tolazoline, and ponazuril, which are not approved for use in horses intended for human consumption;
:(4) consuming parts of an equine raised in the United States likely poses a serious threat to human health and the public should be protected from these unsafe products; and
:(5) the sale and transport of equines for the purpose of processing for human consumption, and the sale and transport of equine parts for human consumption, are economic in nature and substantially affect interstate and foreign commerce.

=Sec. 3. Prohibitions=

 Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// 21 U.S.C. 331] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>
:(ccc) 
::(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sale or transport of equines in interstate commerce, or the importing or exporting (or offering for import or export) of equines into or out of the United States, by any person who knows or reasonably should have known that such equines are to be slaughtered for human consumption as food.
::(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sale or transport of equine parts (including flesh, meat, and viscera) in interstate commerce, or the importing or exporting (or offering for import or export) of such parts into or out of the United States, by any person who knows or reasonably should have known that such equine parts are to be used for human consumption as food..
