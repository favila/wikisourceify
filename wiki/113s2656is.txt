{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide for the regulation of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemical substances, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Protecting America's Families from Toxic Chemicals Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the uses of chemical substances, for which there is evidence of persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and exposure to humans or the environment, are limited to those uses that are critical or essential. 

=Sec. 3. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Administrator– ==

The term Administrator means the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]].

==(2) Chemical substance– ==

The term chemical substance has the meaning given the term in  section 3 of the Toxic Substances Control Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2602 15 U.S.C. 2602] ).
