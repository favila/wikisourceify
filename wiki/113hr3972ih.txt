{{Center|A BILL}}

 To prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis of an individual’s status or history of unemployment.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Fair Employment Opportunity Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that denial of employment opportunities to individuals because they are or have been unemployed is discriminatory and burdens commerce by—
:(1) reducing personal consumption and undermining economic stability and growth;
:(2) squandering human capital essential to the Nation’s economic vibrancy and growth;
:(3) increasing demands for State and Federal unemployment insurance benefits, reducing trust fund assets, and leading to higher payroll taxes for employers, cuts in benefits for jobless workers, or both;
:(4) imposing additional burdens on publicly funded health and welfare programs; and
:(5) depressing income, property, and other tax revenues that States, localities and the Federal Government rely on to support operations and institutions essential to commerce.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to prohibit consideration of an individual’s status as unemployed in screening for or filling positions except where a requirement related to employment status is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to successful performance in the job and to eliminate the burdens imposed on commerce by excluding such individuals from employment. 

=Sec. 3. Definitions=

As used in this Act—
:(1) the term employer means any person engaged in commerce or any industry or activity affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and includes—
::(A) any person who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of an employer with respect to employing individuals to work for the employer; and
::(B) any successor in interest of an employer;
:(2) the term employment agency means any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure employees for an employer or to procure for individuals opportunities to work for an employer and includes an agent of such a person, and includes any person who maintains an Internet website that publishes advertisements or announcements of job openings;
:(3) the term affected individual means any person who was refused consideration for employment or was not hired by an employer because of the person’s current employment status, or any person who was not considered, screened, or referred for employment opportunities by an employment agency because of the person’s current employment status;
:(4) the term status as unemployed means an individual’s present or past unemployment regardless of the length of time such individual was unemployed; and
:(5) the term Secretary means the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] . 

=Sec. 4. Prohibited acts=

It shall be an unlawful practice for an employer to—
:(1) refuse to consider for employment or refuse to offer employment to an individual because of the individual’s status as unemployed;
:(2) publish in print, on the Internet, or in any other medium, an advertisement or announcement for any job that includes—
::(A) any provision stating or indicating that an individual’s status as unemployed disqualifies the individual for a job; and

==(c) Interference with rights, proceedings or inquiries– ==

It shall be unlawful for any employer or employment agency to—
:(1) interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise, any right provided under this Act; or

::(C) has given, or is about to give, any information in connection with any inquiry or proceeding relating to any right provided under this Act; or
::(D) has testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or proceeding relating to any right provided under this Act.

==(d) Bona fide occupational qualification– ==

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, consideration by an employer or employment agency of an individual’s status as unemployed shall not be an unlawful employment practice where an individual’s employment in a similar or related job for a period of time reasonably proximate to the hiring of such individual is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to successful performance of the job that is being filled.
