::(B) by amending subparagraph (A)(ii) to read as follows:

<blockquote> 
:::(ii) may not exceed the time the stock would be rebuilt without fishing occurring plus one mean generation, except in a case in which—
::::(I) the biology of the stock of fish, other environmental conditions, or management measures under an international agreement in which the United States participates dictate otherwise;
::::(II) the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]determines that the cause of the stock being depleted is outside the jurisdiction of the Council or the rebuilding program cannot be effective only by limiting fishing activities;
::::(III) the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]determines that one or more components of a mixed-stock fishery is depleted but cannot be rebuilt within that time- frame without significant economic harm to the fishery, or cannot be rebuilt without causing another component of the mixed-stock fishery to approach a depleted status;
::::(IV) the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]determines that recruitment, distribution, or life history of, or fishing activities for, the stock are affected by informal transboundary agreements under which management activities outside the exclusive economic zone by another country may hinder conservation and management efforts by United States fishermen; and
::::(V) the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]determines that the stock has been affected by unusual events that make rebuilding within the specified time period improbable without significant economic harm to fishing communities; ; 
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 

===(m) Considerations for modifications to annual catch limit requirements– ===



====(1) Consideration of ecosystem and economic impacts– ====

In establishing annual catch limits a Council may, consistent with section 302(h)(6) , consider changes in an ecosystem and the economic needs of the fishing communities.

====(2) Limitations to annual catch limit requirement for special fisheries– ====

Notwithstanding subsection (h)(6) , a Council is not required to develop an annual catch limit for—
:(A) an ecosystem component species;
:(B) a fishery for a species that has a life cycle of approximately 1 year, unless the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]has determined the fishery is subject to overfishing; or
:(C) a stock for which—
::(i) more than half of a single-year class will complete their life cycle in less than 18 months; and
::(ii) fishing mortality will have little impact on the stock.

====(3) Relationship to international fishery efforts– ====

Each annual catch limit may, consistent with section 302(h)(6) , take into account—
:(A) management measures under international agreements in which the United States participates; and
:(B) informal transboundary agreements under which fishery management activities by another country outside the exclusive economic zone may hinder conservation efforts by United States fishermen for a fish species for which any of the recruitment, distribution, life history, or fishing activities are transboundary.

====(4) Authorization for multispecies complexes and multiyear annual catch limits– ====

For purposes of subsection (h)(6) , a Council may establish—
:(A) an annual catch limit for a stock complex; or
:(B) annual catch limits for each year in any continuous period that is not more than three years in duration.

====(5) Ecosystem component species defined– ====

In this subsection the term“ecosystem component species”means a stock of fish that is a nontarget, incidentally harvested stock of fish in a fishery, or a nontarget, incidentally harvested stock of fish that a Council or the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]has determined—
:(A) is not subject to overfishing, approaching a depleted condition or depleted; and
:(B) is not likely to become subject to overfishing or depleted in the absence of conservation and management measures. .

:(2) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following:

<blockquote> 
::(8a) The term ‘depleted' means, with respect to a stock of fish or stock complex, that the stock or stock complex has a biomass that has declined below a level that jeopardizes the capacity of the stock or stock complex to produce maximum sustainable yield on a continuing basis. . 
</blockquote>


===(b) Substitution of term– ===

The  Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1801 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.] )is amended by striking“overfished”each place it appears and inserting“depleted”.

The report shall state, for each fishery identified as depleted or approaching that condition, whether the fishery is the target of directed fishing.”.

==Sec. 106. Transparency and public process==



===(a) Advice– ===

==Title II— Revitalizing the Economy of Fisheries in the Pacific==



==Sec. 201. Short title==

This title may be cited as the“ Revitalizing the Economy of Fisheries in the Pacific Act ”or the“ REFI Pacific Act ”.

==Sec. 202. Findings; purpose==



===(a) Findings– ===

Congress makes the following findings:
:(1) In 2000, the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]declared the West Coast groundfish fishery a Federal fisheries economic disaster due to low stock abundance, an overcapitalized fleet, and historically overfished stocks.
:(2)   Section 212 of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003 (title II of division B of [[Public Law 108-7|Public Law 108–7]]  ;117 Stat. 80) was enacted to establish a Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity reduction program, also known as a buyback program, to remove excess fishing capacity.
:(3) In 2003, Congress authorized the $35,700,000 buyback loan, creating the Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity reduction program through theNational Marine Fisheries Servicefisheries finance program with a term of 30 years. The interest rate of the buyback loan was fixed at 6.97 percent and is paid back based on an ex-vessel fee landing rate not to exceed 5 percent for the loan.
:(4) The groundfish fishing capacity reduction program resulted in the removal of limited entry trawl Federal fishing permits from the fishery, representing approximately 46 percent of total landings at the time.
:(5) Because of an absence of a repayment mechanism, $4,243,730 in interest accrued before fee collection procedures were established in 2005, over 18 months after the groundfish fishing capacity reduction program was initiated.
:(6) In 2011, the West Coast groundfish fishery transitioned to an individual fishing quota fishery, which is a type of catch share program.
:(7) By 2015, West Coast groundfish fishermen’s expenses are expected to include fees of approximately $450 per day for observers, a 3-percent cost recovery fee as authorized by the  Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1801 16 U.S.C. 1801])for catch share programs, and a 5-percent ex-vessel landings rate for the loan repayment, which could reach 18 percent of their total gross revenue.
:(8) In 2012, the West Coast groundfish limited entry trawl fishery generated $63,000,000, an increase from an average of $45,000,000 during the years 2006 to 2011. This revenue is expected to continue to increase post-rationalization.

===(b) Purpose– ===

The purpose of this title is to refinance the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery fishing capacity reduction program to protect and conserve the West Coast groundfish fishery and the coastal economies in California, Oregon, and Washington that rely on it.
