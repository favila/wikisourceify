{{Center|A BILL}}

 To clarify the standard required for the importation of sporting arms into the United States, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Firearm Importation Fairness Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings; purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Citizens have a fundamental, individual right, under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court has held that the right to self-defense, rather than“sport”is at the core of that right.
:(2) Despite the meaning of the Second Amendment as interpreted by the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]],[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/925 section 925(d) of title 18, United States Code], requires the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]]to approve the importation of firearms into the United States for private ownership, but generally only if the firearms are determined to be suitable for or adaptable to“sporting purposes”.
:(3) The Executive Branch has interpreted“sporting purposes”in a narrow and obstructive manner, impeding firearms imports, interfering with citizens’ constitutional rights, and diminishing consumer choice. These interpretations have resulted in bans on the importation of firearms that are completely legal to make, sell, and own in the United States.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are as follows:
:(1) To clarify the standard used to import firearms into the United States.
:(2) To make it clear that firearms imports may not be subject to discriminatory treatment, and that firearms should be importable for all lawful purposes, including hunting, self defense, collecting, competitive shooting, and plinking.
:(3) To prevent the further impediment of commerce by allowing faster consideration of firearm import permits.
