[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:

			 met the statutory deadline in one of his five budget submissions.

			 balance.
:(5) The [[Wikipedia:Executive Office of the President|President’s]]
			 fiscal year 2013 budget submission includes the admission that under his own
			 policies the Federal Government’s “fiscal position gradually
			 deteriorates”.
