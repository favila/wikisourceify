Findings

          [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
(1)
With this year’s
			 expected failure to meet the statutory deadline for submission of his budget,
			 as stated by the [[Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management and Budget]], the [[Executive Office of the President|President]] will have only
			 met the statutory deadline in one of his five budget submissions.

(2)
Despite a promise
			 to cut the deficit in half, the deficit doubled during the [[Executive Office of the President|President’s]] first
			 year in office and has exceeded $1 trillion for four years now.

(3)
Since taking
			 office, the [[Executive Office of the President|President]] has allowed the Federal debt to grow by nearly $6
			 trillion and total debt now exceeds the size of the entire economy of the
			 United States.

(4)
Under the
			 [[Executive Office of the President|President’s]] most recent budget submission, the budget never achieves
			 balance.

(5)
The [[Executive Office of the President|President’s]]
			 fiscal year 2013 budget submission includes the admission that under his own
			 policies the Federal Government’s fiscal position gradually
			 deteriorates
.
