To require the periodic review and automatic termination of Federal regulations.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Regulatory Sunset and Review Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to require agencies to regularly review their significant rules to determine whether they should be continued without change, modified, consolidated with another rule, or terminated;
:(2) to require agencies to consider the comments of the public, the regulated community, and the [[w:|Congress]] regarding the actual costs and burdens of rules being reviewed under this Act, and whether the rules are obsolete, unnecessary, duplicative, conflicting, or otherwise inconsistent;
:(3) to require that any rules continued in effect under this Act meet all the legal requirements that would apply to the issuance of a new rule, including any applicable Federal cost-benefit and risk assessment requirements;
:(4) to provide for the review of significant rules and other rules through a sunset review process and to provide for the repeal or other change in such rules in accordance withchapters 5and7 of title 5, United States Code;
:(5) to provide for a petition process that allows the public and appropriate committees of the [[w:|Congress]] to request that other rules that are not significant be reviewed in the same manner as significant rules; and
:(6) to require the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] to coordinate and be responsible for sunset reviews conducted by the agencies.

=Sec. 3. Review of regulations=

A covered rule shall be subject to review in accordance with this Act. Upon completion of such review, the agency which has jurisdiction over such rule shall—
:(1) issue a final report under section 8(c)(2)continuing such rule, or
:(2) conduct a rulemaking in accordance with section 8(d)to modify, consolidate with another rule, or terminate such rule.

=Sec. 4. Rules covered=



==(a) Covered rules– ==

For purposes of this Act, a covered rule is a rule that—
:(1) is determined by the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] to be a significant rule under subsection (b); or
:(2) is any other rule designated by the agency which has jurisdiction over such rule or the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] under this Act for sunset review.

==(b) Significant rules– ==

For purposes of this Act, a significant rule is a rule that the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] determines—
:(1) has resulted in or is likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more;
:(2) is a major rule; or
:(3) was issued pursuant to a significant regulatory action, as that term is defined in Executive Order 12866 (as in effect on the first date that Executive order was in effect).

==(c) Public petitions– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Any person adversely affected by a rule that is not a significant rule may submit a petition to the agency which has jurisdiction over the rule requesting that such agency designate the rule for sunset review. Such agency shall designate the rule for sunset review unless such agency determines that it would not be in the public interest to conduct a sunset review of the rule. In making such determination, such agency shall take into account the number and nature of other petitions received on the same rule and whether or not such petitions have been denied.

===(2) Form and content of petition– ===

A petition under paragraph (1)—
:(A) shall be in writing, but is not otherwise required to be in any particular form; and
:(B) shall identify the rule for which sunset review is requested with reasonable specificity and state on its face that the petitioner seeks sunset review of the rule.

===(3) Response required for noncomplying petitions– ===

If an agency determines that a petition does not meet the requirements of this subsection, the agency shall provide a response to the petitioner within 30 days after receiving the petition, notifying the petitioner of the problem and providing information on how to formulate a petition that meets those requirements.

===(4) Decision within 90 days– ===

Within the 90-day period beginning on the date of receiving a petition that meets the requirements of this subsection, the agency shall transmit a response to the petitioner stating whether the petition was granted or denied, except that the agency may extend such period by a total of not more than 30 days.

===(5) Petitions deemed granted for substantial inexcusable delay– ===

A petition for sunset review of a rule is deemed to have been granted by an agency, and such agency is deemed to have designated the rule for sunset review, if a court finds there is a substantial and inexcusable delay, beyond the period specified in paragraph (4), in notifying the petitioner of the agency’s determination to grant or deny the petition.

===(6) Public log– ===

Each agency shall maintain a public log of petitions submitted under this subsection, that includes the status or disposition of each petition.

==(d) Congressional requests– ==



===(1) In general– ===

An appropriate committee of the [[w:|Congress]] , or a majority of the majority party members or a majority of nonmajority party members of such committee, may request in writing that the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] designate any rule that is not a significant rule for sunset review. The [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] shall designate such rule for sunset review within 30 days after receipt of such request unless the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] determines that it would not be in the public interest to conduct a sunset review of such rule.

===(2) Notice of denial– ===

If the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] denies a congressional request under this subsection, the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] shall transmit to the congressional committee making the request a notice stating the reasons for the denial.

==(e) Publication of notice of designation for sunset review– ==

After designating a rule under subsection (c)or (d)for sunset review, the agency or the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] shall promptly publish a notice of that designation in the Federal Register.

=Sec. 5. Criteria for sunset review=



==(a) Compliance with other laws– ==

In order for any rule subject to sunset review to continue without change or to be modified or consolidated in accordance with this Act, such rule must be authorized by law and meet all applicable requirements that would apply if it were issued as a new rule pursuant to [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 section 553 of title 5, United States Code] , or other statutory rulemaking procedures required for that rule. For purposes of this section, the term applicable requirements includes any requirement for cost-benefit analysis and any requirement for standardized risk analysis and risk assessment.

==(b) Governing law– ==

If there is a conflict between applicable requirements and an Act under which a rule was issued, the conflict shall be resolved in the same manner as such conflict would be resolved if the agency were issuing a new rule.

===(3) Rules covered pursuant to public petition or congressional request– ===

For any rule subject to sunset review pursuant to a public petition under section 4(c)or a congressional request under section 4(d), the initial review deadline is the last day of the 3-year period beginning on—

:(B) the date of issuance of a final court order that the agency is deemed to have designated the rule for sunset review.

===(4) Related rule designated for review– ===

For a rule that the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] designates under section 6(a)(3)for sunset review because it is related to another covered rule and that is grouped with that other rule for simultaneous review, the initial review deadline is the same as the review deadline for that other rule.

==(b) Temporary extension– ==

The review deadline under subsection (a)for a covered rule may be extended by the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator]] for not more than 6 months by publishing notice thereof in the Federal Register that describes reasons why the temporary extension is necessary to respond to or prevent an emergency situation.

==(c) Determinations where rules have been amended– ==

::(F) whether, and to what extent, the rule imposed unfunded mandates on, or otherwise affected, State and local governments;
