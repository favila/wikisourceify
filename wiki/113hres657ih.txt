{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding United States support for the State of Israel as it defends itself against unprovoked rocket attacks from the Hamas terrorist organization.    Whereas Hamas is a United States-designated terrorist organization whose charter calls for the destruction of the State of Israel;   Whereas Hamas continues to reject the Quartet’s core principles—recognize Israel’s right to exist, renounce violence, and accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements;   Whereas Hamas has killed hundreds of Israelis and dozens of Americans in rocket attacks and suicide bombings;   Whereas since Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, Hamas and other terrorist groups have fired thousands of rockets at Israel;   Whereas since June 2014, Hamas has fired nearly 300 rockets at Israel;   Whereas Hamas’s weapons arsenal includes approximately 12,000 rockets that vary in range;   Whereas innocent Israeli civilians are indiscriminately targeted by Hamas rocket attacks; and   Whereas 5 million Israelis are currently living under the threat of rocket attacks from Gaza: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]—
:(1) reaffirms its support for Israel’s right to defend its citizens and ensure the survival of the State of Israel;
:(2) condemns the unprovoked rocket fire at Israel; and
:(3) calls on Hamas to immediately cease all rocket and other attacks against Israel.
