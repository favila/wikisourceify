{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Congratulating the State of Qatar on the ascension of their new amir, Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on June 25, 2013, and recognizing the special relationship between the United States and the State of Qatar.Whereas since the signing of the Defense Cooperation Agreement in 1991 and joint military coordination in Operation Desert Storm, Qatar has been one of the United States strongest and most valued allies in the Middle East;Whereas the 18-year reign of Sheik Tamim’s father, His Highness Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani marked a pivotal period of political modernization and reform in the small Gulf nation, and commenced a series of diplomatic, cultural, and economic engagement between Qatar and the West;Whereas Qatar has been a staunch partner of the United States in promoting peace and stability in the Arab world, and has been a driving force in opposing extremism and authoritarian oppression;Whereas Al Udeid Air Base and As Saliyah Army Base south of Doha have served as major operations and basing hubs for United States Central Command (CENTCOM) strategic central facilities in the War on Terror in Iraq and Afghanistan;Whereas in 2011, Qatar deployed fighter jets and transport planes to support the joint United States-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military intervention against Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, and has also been one of the staunchest advocates in pressuring the international community to liberate the Syrian people from the oppressive Bashar al-Assad regime;Whereas Qatar has fostered invaluable, international academic exchange in the arts and sciences by hosting satellite campuses of major United States universities and medical institutions including Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Cornell University, Northwestern University, Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, Texas A&M University, and Carnegie Mellon University;Whereas the Al Thani royal family has earnestly promoted good will and friendship between the United States and Qatar, and in 2005 Amir Hamad bin Khalifa donated $100,000,000 to help rebuild housing, hospitals, and schools in the Gulf region following Hurricane Katrina;Whereas His Highness Amir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani’s background as a British-educated businessman, deputy head of Qatar’s armed forces, and membership on the International Olympic Committee perfectly suit him to continue his country’s legacy as a positive force for peace, stability, investment, and modernization in the Arab world and beyond; andWhereas the 33-year-old amir’s resonance with the young people in the Middle East uniquely qualify him to build upon the call among the youth of the Arab world to implement the “Arab Spring’s” promises of liberty and political reform: Now, therefore, be it
