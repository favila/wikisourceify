{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Commending the Boys & Girls Clubs of America for its role in improving outcomes for millions of young people and thousands of communities.    Whereas, in 1956, the Boys' Clubs of America celebrated its 50th anniversary and became a federally chartered incorporation;   Whereas, in 1991, the Federal charter of the Boys' Clubs of America was amended to reflect the change of the name of the organization to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America;   Whereas the Boys & Girls Clubs of America has significantly improved the quality of life for many young people and has helped to transform them into leaders and responsible citizens of the United States;   Whereas the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, through its efforts in communities throughout the United States, has a significant impact on the ability of young people to meet various challenges, including by helping them graduate from high school, gain proficiency in science, technology, engineering, and math, and develop skills for the 21st century;   Whereas evaluations of specific programs conducted by, and of the overall experience of participating in, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America demonstrate several positive outcomes linked to participation in the organization, including reduction in delinquent behaviors, increased academic achievement, increased access to and safe use of technology, broadened career goals, and improved attitudes toward school;   Whereas the Boys & Girls Clubs of America effectively leverages limited Federal investment to support clubs in underfunded communities, while raising the majority of its funding privately;   Whereas the Boys & Girls Clubs of America serves diverse groups of young people in urban, suburban, and rural communities, as well as on military bases and Native American reservations;   Whereas the Boys & Girls Clubs of America provides stability, education, youth development, and prevention programs for children of military personnel, who frequently relocate due to station changes and deployments;   Whereas, as of February 2013, there are 3,985 chartered clubs serving approximately 4,100,000 young people; and   Whereas, on April 28, 2012, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America signed an agreement with For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (commonly known as FIRST ) to bring competitive robotics programs to approximately 4,000,000 young people in the United States by 2015: Now, therefore, be it
