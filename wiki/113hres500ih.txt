{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week.    Whereas multiple sclerosis can impact men and women of all ages, races, and ethnicities, but is more common (at least 2–3 times) in women than men;   Whereas approximately 2,300,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis;   Whereas multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, however it is estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents are living with multiple sclerosis in the United States;   Whereas multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable neurological disease that interrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and the rest of the body;   Whereas symptoms of multiple sclerosis range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis and the progress, severity and specific symptoms of multiple sclerosis in any one person cannot yet be predicted;   Whereas there is no laboratory test available that definitely defines a diagnosis for multiple sclerosis;   Whereas multiple sclerosis is not directly inherited, but studies show there are genetic and likely environmental factors that indicate certain individuals are susceptible to the disease, such as Caucasians of northern European ancestry;   Whereas the exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still unknown and there is no cure;   Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national network of independent multiple sclerosis organizations dedicated to the enhancement of the quality of life for all those affected by multiple sclerosis, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of every calendar year;   Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition’s mission is to increase opportunities for cooperation and provide greater opportunity to leverage the effective use of resources for the benefit of the multiple sclerosis community;   Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are to invite people to join the movement to end multiple sclerosis, encourage everyone to do something to demonstrate their commitment to moving toward a world free of multiple sclerosis, and to acknowledge those who have dedicated their time and talent to help promote multiple sclerosis research and programs; and   Whereas this year Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is recognized during the week of March 3, 2014, through March 9, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
