{{section|HED5F79ACBCD34AEFAB38914B116B1C61|2. Findings}}
The [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds and declares the
			 following:
(1)
The Nation is
			 currently experiencing a national employment emergency, and urgent action is
			 needed to put Americans back to work in well-paid, long-term jobs.

(2)
The Federal
			 Government distributed over $10,000,000,000 to Federal, State, and Indian
			 accounts from energy production during fiscal year 2009, primarily from oil and
			 natural gas production.

(3)
The domestic oil
			 and natural gas industry is responsible for approximately 9.2 million
			 jobs.

(4)
The approximately
			 43 million leased Outer Continental Shelf acres currently account for about 15
			 percent of America’s domestic natural gas production and about 27 percent of
			 America’s domestic oil production.

(5)
The leasing of
			 these domestic offshore areas for oil and natural gas development provides
			 significant economic benefits to the Federal Government, as well as to States
			 and localities, through the creation and sustenance of jobs and domestic
			 product.

(6)
The [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of
			 the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management]] currently has authorities
			 under the 
            Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
 (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.
)
 and
			 related laws that can be effectively utilized to create jobs and revitalize the
			 Nation’s economy.

(7)
Effective and
			 expedited development of Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas resources could
			 generate thousands of new jobs, many of which could be created almost
			 immediately.

(8)
The coastal
			 regions of the United States have high productivity and contribute
			 approximately 50 percent of the gross domestic product of the United
			 States.

(9)
The economies and
			 social structure of many communities are dependent on resources from ocean,
			 coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems.

(10)
Supporting
			 science, research, monitoring, modeling, forecasting, exploration, and
			 assessment will continue to improve our understanding of the ocean, coastal,
			 and Great Lakes ecosystems as well as their long-term economic
			 sustainability.

(11)
Safeguarding
			 these ecosystems is crucial to protecting the environment and waters of the
			 United States.

(12)
The growth of our
			 energy domestic resources is vital to America’s national security.


{{section|H2D7EAE80AB9D43A59F1B477301CFECA8|3. Purposes}}
The purposes of this Act are the
			 following:

			 Interior’s]] responsibilities regarding conservation, safety, and protection of
			 the environment.

(2)
Promote expansion
			 of domestic employment opportunities.

(3)
Respond to the
			 Nation’s increased need for domestic oil and natural gas resources.

(4)
Support the
			 utilization of the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas production and

Protect, conserve, restore, and understand
			 the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes of the United States, ensuring present and
			 future generations will benefit from the full range of ecological, economic,
			 educational, social, cultural, nutritional, and recreational opportunities and
			 services those resources are capable of providing.

(6)
Confirm and ensure
			 the validity of appropriate oil and gas leases issued under the Final Outer
			 Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, 2007–2012.

(7)
Ensure the
			 continued leasing of Outer Continental Shelf areas pursuant to the Final Outer
			 Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, 2007–2012.
