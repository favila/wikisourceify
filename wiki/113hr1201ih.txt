=====(A) Additional residency positions– =====



======(i) In general– ======

For each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018 (and succeeding fiscal years if the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines that there are additional residency positions available to distribute under clause (iv)(II)), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall, subject to clause (ii)and subparagraph (D), increase the otherwise applicable resident limit for each qualifying hospital that submits a timely application under this subparagraph by such number as the Secretary may approve for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after July 1 of the fiscal year of the increase.

======(ii) Number available for distribution– ======

For each such fiscal year, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall determine the total number of additional residency positions available for distribution under clause (i)in accordance with the following:

=======(I) Allocation to hospitals already operating over resident limit– =======

One-third of such number shall be available for distribution only to hospitals described in subparagraph (B).

=======(II) Aggregate limitation– =======

Except as provided in clause (iv)(I), the aggregate number of increases in the otherwise applicable resident limit under this subparagraph shall be equal to 3,000 in each such year.

======(iii) Process for distributing positions– ======



=======(I) Rounds of applications– =======

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall initiate 5 separate rounds of applications for an increase under clause (i), 1 round with respect to each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018.

=======(II) Number available– =======

In each of such rounds, the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the fiscal year under clause (ii)shall be distributed, plus any additional positions available under clause (iv).

=======(III) Timing– =======

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall notify hospitals of the number of positions distributed to the hospital under this paragraph as a result of an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit by January 1 of the fiscal year of the increase. Such increase shall be effective for portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1 of that fiscal year.

======(iv) Positions not distributed during the fiscal year– ======



=======(I) In general– =======

If the number of resident full-time equivalent positions distributed under this paragraph in a fiscal year is less than the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the fiscal year (as described in clause (ii), including after application of this subclause), the difference between such number distributed and such number available for distribution shall be added to the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the following fiscal year.

=======(II) Exception if positions not distributed by end of fiscal year 2018– =======

If the aggregate number of positions distributed under this paragraph during the 5-year period of fiscal years 2014 through 2018 is less than 15,000, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall, in accordance with the provisions of clause (ii)and subparagraph (D)and the considerations and priority described in subparagraph (C), conduct an application and distribution process in each subsequent fiscal year until such time as the aggregate amount of positions distributed under this paragraph is equal to 15,000.

=====(B) Allocation of distribution for positions to hospitals already operating over resident limit– =====



======(i) In general– ======

Subject to clauses (ii)and (iii), in the case of a hospital in which the reference resident level of the hospital (as specified in subparagraph (G)(iii)) is greater than the otherwise applicable resident limit, the increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit under subparagraph (A)for a fiscal year described in such subparagraph shall be an amount equal to the product of the total number of additional residency positions available for distribution under subparagraph (A)(ii)(I)for such fiscal year and the quotient of—
:(I) the number of resident positions by which the reference resident level of the hospital exceeds the otherwise applicable resident limit for the hospital; and
:(II) the number of resident positions by which the reference resident level of all such hospitals with respect to which an application is approved under this paragraph exceeds the otherwise applicable resident limit for such hospitals.

======(ii) Requirements– ======

A hospital described in clause (i)—
:(I) is not eligible for an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit under this subparagraph unless the amount by which the reference resident level of the hospital exceeds the otherwise applicable resident limit is not less than 10 and the hospital trains at least 30 percent of the full-time equivalent residents of the hospital in primary care and general surgery (as of the date of enactment of this paragraph); and
:(II) shall continue to train at least 30 percent of the full-time equivalent residents of the hospital in primary care and general surgery for the 5-year period beginning on such date.In the case where the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines that a hospital described in clause (i)no longer meets the requirement of subclause (II), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may reduce the otherwise applicable resident limit of the hospital by the amount by which such limit was increased under this subparagraph.

======(iii) Clarification regarding eligibility for other additional residency positions– ======

Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as preventing a hospital described in clause (i)from applying for and receiving additional residency positions under this paragraph that are not reserved for distribution under this subparagraph.

=====(C) Distribution of other positions– =====

For purposes of determining an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit under subparagraph (A)(other than such an increase described in subparagraph (B)), the following shall apply:

======(i) Considerations in distribution– ======

In determining for which hospitals such an increase is provided under subparagraph (A), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall take into account the demonstrated likelihood of the hospital filling the positions made available under this paragraph within the first 5 cost reporting periods beginning after the date the increase would be effective, as determined by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] .

======(ii) Priority for certain hospitals– ======

Subject to clause (iii), in determining for which hospitals such an increase is provided, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall distribute the increase in the following priority order:

:(IV) Fourth, to all other hospitals.

======(iii) Distribution to hospitals in higher priority group prior to distribution in lower priority groups– ======

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may only distribute such an increase to a lower priority group under clause (ii)if all qualifying hospitals in the higher priority group or groups have received the maximum number of increases under such subparagraph that the hospital is eligible for under this paragraph for the fiscal year.

:(bb) the total number of full-time equivalent residents, excluding any additional positions attributable to such increase, is not less than the average number of full-time equivalent residents during the 3 most recent cost reporting periods ending on or before the effective date of such increase; and
:(cc) the ratio of full-time equivalent residents in a shortage specialty residency program (as so defined) is not less than the average ratio of full-time equivalent residents in such a program during the 3 most recent cost reporting periods ending on or before the effective date of such increase.
