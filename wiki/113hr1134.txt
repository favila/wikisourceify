{{section|HE02D04064E8C4D029453178CA38F9C98|1. Findings}}

        [[United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following
			 findings:
(1)
The estimated
			 veteran population of the Nation is 22,328,000.

(2)
Nearly 30 percent
			 of veterans live in rural areas, with younger veterans who served in support of
			 Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom more likely than other
			 veterans to live in rural areas.

(3)
Veterans living in
			 rural areas are reported to be in poorer health than veterans living in urban
			 areas.

(4)
Veterans living in
			 rural areas often need to travel extremely long distances to receive medical
			 care and the other services to which they are entitled.

(5)
The medical
			 facilities of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] include 821 community-based
			 outpatient clinics, 300 veterans centers, and 152 hospitals.

(6)
Rural veterans
			 represent 41 percent of the total number of veterans enrolled in the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department
			 of Veterans Affairs]] patient enrollment system under section 1705
 of title 38,
			 United States Code
.

(7)
A
			 higher percentage of veterans residing in rural areas reported having at least
			 one disability compared with veterans residing in urban areas.

(8)
Each year more
			 than 150,000 members of the Armed Forces are discharged or separated from
			 service in the Armed Forces and transition to veteran status.

(9)
Navigating the
			 transition from the health care system of [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to the health
			 care system of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] involves the coordination of
			 data and information between [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of
			 Veterans Affairs]].

(10)
It is important
			 to develop electronic health records that can be accessed by both the
			 [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] whether a patient
			 is a member of the Armed Forces or a veteran to ensure the greater availability
			 of health care information for members of the Armed Forces and veterans.
