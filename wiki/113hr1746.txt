This Act may be cited as the“Truth in Employment Act of 2013”.

=={{anchor|HC8E8640C2E044519825DDCF4CA61CAAB}}(a) Findings– ==

Congress finds the following:
:(1) An atmosphere of trust and civility in labor-management relationships is essential to a productive workplace and a healthy economy.
:(2) The tactic of using professional union organizers and agents to infiltrate a targeted employer’s workplace, a practice commonly referred to as“salting”has evolved into an aggressive form of harassment not contemplated when the National Labor Relations Actwas enacted and threatens the balance of rights which is fundamental to our system of collective bargaining.
:(3) Increasingly, union organizers are seeking employment with nonunion employers not because of a desire to work for such employers but primarily to organize the employees of such employers or to inflict economic harm specifically designed to put nonunion competitors out of business, or to do both.
:(4) While no employer may discriminate against employees based upon the views of employees concerning collective bargaining, an employer should have the right to expect job applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing the skills of the applicants to further the goals of the business of the employer.

=={{anchor|HB9F560CBABF346A58DE320AA5CC3BDFB}}(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations which is fundamental to our system of collective bargaining;
:(2) to preserve the rights of workers to organize, or otherwise engage in concerted activities protected under the National Labor Relations Act; and
:(3) to alleviate pressure on employers to hire individuals who seek or gain employment in order to disrupt the workplace of the employer or otherwise inflict economic harm designed to put the employer out of business.
