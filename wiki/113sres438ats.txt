{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Congratulating the students, parents, teachers, and administrators of charter schools across the United States for their ongoing contributions to education, and supporting the ideals and goals of the 15th annual National Charter Schools Week, to be held May 4 through May 10, 2014.    Whereas charter schools are public schools that do not charge tuition and enroll any student who wants to attend a charter school, often through a random lottery when too many students want to attend a single charter school;   Whereas high-performing charter schools deliver a high-quality public education and challenge all students to reach their potential for academic success;   Whereas charter schools promote innovation and excellence in public education;   Whereas charter schools throughout the United States provide millions of families with diverse and innovative educational options for their children;   Whereas high-performing charter schools are dramatically increasing student achievement and college-going rates;   Whereas charter schools are authorized by a designated public entity and— 
:(1) respond to the needs of communities, families, and students in the United States; and 
:(2) promote the principles of quality, accountability, choice, and innovation;   Whereas in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, charter schools are held accountable by the public authorizers of such charter schools for improving student achievement and for sound financial and operational management;   Whereas charter schools are required to meet the student achievement accountability requirements under the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.])in the same manner as traditional public schools;   Whereas charter schools often set higher expectations for students, beyond the requirements under the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.]), to ensure that such charter schools are of high quality and truly accountable to the public;   Whereas 42 States and the District of Columbia have enacted laws authorizing charter schools;   Whereas more than 6,400 charter schools serve more than 2,500,000 children;   Whereas in the United States— 
:(1) in 135 school districts, more than 10 percent of public school students are enrolled in charter schools; 
:(2) in 32 school districts, at least 20 percent of public school students are enrolled in charter schools; and 
:(3) in 7 districts, at least 30 percent of public school students are enrolled in charter schools;   Whereas charter schools improve the achievement of students enrolled in such charter schools and collaborate with traditional public schools to improve public education for all students;   Whereas charter schools— 
:(1) give parents the freedom to choose public schools; 
:(2) routinely measure parental satisfaction levels; and 
:(3) must prove their ongoing success to parents, policymakers, and the communities served by such charter schools;   Whereas approximately 920,000 students were on waiting lists to attend charter schools before the beginning of the 2012–2013 academic year; and   Whereas the 15th annual National Charter Schools Week is scheduled to be celebrated the week of May 4 through May 10, 2014: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]—
:(1) congratulates the students, families, teachers, and administrators of charter schools across the United States for—
::(A) their ongoing contributions to education;
::(B) their impressive strides in closing the academic achievement gap in schools in the United States, particularly schools with some of the most disadvantaged students in both rural and urban communities; and
::(C) improving and strengthening the public school system in the United States;
:(2) supports the ideals and goals of the 15th annual National Charter Schools Week, a week-long celebration to be held the week of May 4 through May 10, 2014, in communities throughout the United States; and
:(3) encourages the people of the United States to hold appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities during National Charter Schools Week to demonstrate support for charter schools.
