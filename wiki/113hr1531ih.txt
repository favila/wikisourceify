:(4) According to the American Cancer Society, most breast cancer patients undergo some type of surgical treatment, which may involve lumpectomy or mastectomy with removal of some of the axillary lymph nodes.
:(5) The offering and operation of health plans affect commerce among the States.
:(6) Health care providers located in a State serve patients who reside in the State and patients who reside in other States.
