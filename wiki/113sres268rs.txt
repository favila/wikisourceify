{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Condemning the September 2013 terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, and reaffirming United States support for the people and Government of Kenya, and for other purposes.    Whereas, on September 21, 2013, armed terrorists attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing more than 60 people and injuring at least 175 from at least 12 different countries during a four-day siege;   Whereas the attack was the most deadly terrorist incident in Kenya since the 1998 al Qaeda bombing of the United States Embassy in Nairobi;   Whereas al Shabaab, a Somali Islamist extremist group with ties to al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for the attack, declaring that it was in retaliation for the Government of Kenya’s participation in the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM);   Whereas al Shabaab was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States Government in 2008 and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity in 2012;   Whereas the investigation to identify those responsible for the attack and efforts to bring them to justice are ongoing;   Whereas Kenya is an important ally and regional security partner, playing a vital role in breaking al Shabaab’s recent stranglehold on Somalia through its participation in AMISOM;   Whereas the Republic of Kenya and the United States have a strong and enduring partnership based on a shared commitment to promoting peace and prosperity in East Africa and around the world; and   Whereas Kenya is a culturally rich and ethnically diverse country: Now, therefore, be it
