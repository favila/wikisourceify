 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the depreciation recovery period for energy-efficient cool roof systems.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Roofing Efficiency Jobs Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Depreciation recovery period for certain roof systems=



==(a) 20–Year recovery period– ==

:(i) initial clearing and grading land improvements with respect to any electric utility transmission and distribution plant, and
:(ii) any qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property. . 
</blockquote>


===(2) Qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property– ===

  Section 168(e) of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

<blockquote> 

====(9) Qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

The term qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property means any roof system—
