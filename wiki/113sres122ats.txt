{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Recognizing the historic significance of the Mexican holiday of Cinco de Mayo.Whereas May 5, or Cinco de Mayo in Spanish, is celebrated each year as a date of great importance by the Mexican and Mexican-American communities;Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, the date on which Mexicans who were struggling for independence and freedom fought the Battle of Puebla;Whereas Cinco de Mayo has become widely celebrated annually by nearly all Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, north and south of the United States-Mexico border;Whereas the Battle of Puebla was but one of the many battles that the courageous Mexican people won in their long and brave struggle for independence and freedom;Whereas the French army, confident that its battle-seasoned troops were far superior to the less-seasoned Mexican troops, expected little or no opposition from the Mexican army;Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat against any of the finest troops of Europe in more than half a century, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly spirited and courageous, Mexican army;Whereas, after 3 bloody assaults on Puebla in which more than 1,000 French soldiers lost their lives, the French troops were finally defeated and driven back by the outnumbered Mexican troops;Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza and his men displayed during that historic battle can never be forgotten;Whereas many brave Mexicans willingly gave their lives for the causes of justice and freedom in the Battle of Puebla on Cinco de Mayo;Whereas the sacrifice of the Mexican fighters was instrumental in keeping Mexico from falling under European domination while, in the United States, the Union Army battled Confederate forces in the Civil War;Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the foundation of the United States was built by people from many countries and diverse cultures who were willing to fight and die for freedom;Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the close ties between the people of Mexico and the people of the United States;Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito Juarez, the president of Mexico during the Battle of Puebla, once said, “El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz” ( “Respect for the rights of others is peace” ); andWhereas many people celebrate Cinco de Mayo during the entire week in which the date falls: Now, therefore, be it
