=Sec. 2. Findings; purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Congress enacted the National Voter Registration Act of 1993( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1973gg 42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.] )to promote the rights of citizens of the United States to exercise the fundamental right to vote, as set forth in the findings of such Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1973gg 42 U.S.C. 1973gg(a)] ).
:(2) While the purposes of such Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1973gg  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1973gg 42 U.S.C. 1973gg(b)] ] )include increasing voter registration and voter participation in elections for Federal office, the language does not refer to individuals in general but refers exclusively to “eligible citizens of the United States” .
:(3) An additional purpose of such Act is to “protect the integrity of the electoral process” ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1973gg 42 U.S.C. 1973gg(b)(3)] ).
:(4) Individuals who do not meet the eligibility requirements for voting in elections for Federal office, including individuals who are not citizens of the United States, have been permitted to register to vote in such elections and are presumably casting ballots in such elections.
