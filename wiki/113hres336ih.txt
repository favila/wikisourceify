{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of the week beginning September 8, 2013, as“National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week”.    Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home support workers, and paraprofessionals (referred to in this preamble as direct support professionals ) are the primary providers of publicly funded long-term supports and services for millions of individuals;   Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, trusted relationship with an individual with disabilities;   Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual with disabilities with the most intimate needs on a daily basis;   Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range of support, including— 
:(1) preparing meals; 
:(2) managing medications; 
:(3) bathing; 
:(4) dressing; 
:(5) helping with mobility; 
:(6) providing transportation to school, work, and religious, and recreational activities; and 
:(7) helping with general daily affairs;   Whereas a direct support professional provides essential support to help keep an individual with disabilities connected to the family and community of the individual;   Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals with disabilities to live meaningful, productive lives;   Whereas a direct support professional is the key to allowing an individual with disabilities to live successfully in the community and avoid more costly institutional care;   Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are female, and many are the sole breadwinners of their families;   Whereas direct support professionals work and pay taxes, but many are impoverished and are eligible for the same Federal and State public assistance programs on which the individuals with disabilities served by the direct support professionals must depend;   Whereas Federal and State policies, as well as the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), assert the right of an individual to live in the home and community of the individual;   Whereas, in 2013, the majority of direct support professionals are employed in home- and community-based settings, and this trend is projected to increase during this decade;   Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage of direct support professionals in every community throughout the United States;   Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to leave jobs due to inadequate wages and benefits, creating high turnover and vacancy rates that research demonstrates adversely affects the quality of support provided to individuals with disabilities; and   Whereas the week beginning September 8, 2013, would be an appropriate week to designate as“National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week”: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]—
:(1) supports the designation of“National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week”;
:(2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals of all ages with disabilities;
:(3) appreciates the contribution of direct support professionals in supporting the needs that are beyond the capacities of millions of families in the United States;
:(4) commends direct support professionals as integral in supporting the long-term support and services system of the United States; and
:(5) finds that the successful implementation of the public policies of the United States depends on the dedication of direct support professionals.
