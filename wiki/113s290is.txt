 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:

:(2) Over 30 million housing units in the United States have significant physical problems or elevated levels of lead, radon, or other contaminants that place their occupants at risk for illnesses or injuries.
:(3) The societal cost of unhealthy housing in terms of lost productivity, missed school days, crime, and disability far exceed the cost of improving housing conditions.
:(4) Cost-effective solutions to residential health and safety hazards exist, including—
::(A) interventions for children and adolescents with asthma to reduce symptom days, improve quality of life, and reduce missed school days;
::(B) housing policies to reduce childhood lead exposure; and
::(C) the installation of safety devices such as smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms to reduce injuries and death from fires and malfunctioning equipment.
:(5) The Federal Government must continue its leadership in demonstrating and implementing projects that support the national goal substantially reducing the number of homes in the United States with residential health and safety hazards.
