=Sec. 3. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]does not consistently implement its policies and Government and private sector best practices for acquisitions and procurement.
:(2) It is difficult to determine the cost of the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department]]’s major acquisition programs because the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department]]has not provided consistent, comparable updates on an annual basis. As of January 2014, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department]]identified over 80 major acquisition programs costing over $300,000,000, and, based on 2011, estimates it plans to spend about $170,000,000,000 in the future on major acquisition programs.
:(3) Since 2005, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]has placed Department acquisition management activities on its“High-Risk List”, which identifies Government operations that have greater susceptibility to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or greater need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.
:(4) While the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department]]has taken actions to address some high-risk acquisition program management issues, many programs continue to experience challenges with funding instability, workforce shortfalls, reliable cost estimates, realistic schedules, agreed-upon baseline objectives, and consistent and reliable data needed to accurately measure program performance.
:(5) Of the 77 Department major acquisition programs in 2011, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]identified 42 programs that experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both. The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department]]reported that the magnitude of the cost growth for 16 of the 42 programs, which increased from almost $20,000,000,000 to over $50,000,000,000 in 2011, had an aggregate increase of 166 percent.
:(6) In 2012, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]found that only 20 of 63 programs had Department-approved acquisition program baselines. The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]also reported that the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department]]planned to spend more than $105 billion on programs lacking acquisition program baselines.
