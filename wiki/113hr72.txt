={{anchor|HC09DC42BDCD141578652CAA2DC592B14}}Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) In 2008, the violence between Mexican drug
			 gangs fighting for trafficking routes to the United States killed approximately
			 6,000 people in Mexico, including more than 500 police officers and
			 soldiers.
:(2) In the first eight
			 weeks of 2009, more than 1,000 people were killed as a result of the drug
			 war.
:(3) In March 2009,
			 Mexico sent an additional 3,200 soldiers to the border, increasing the total
			 number of Mexican solders combating drug cartels to more than 45,000.
:(4) Over 200 United
			 States citizens have been killed in the drug war, either because they were
			 involved in the cartels or were innocent bystanders.
:(5) The drug trade in Mexico include marijuana,
			 heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine (meth).
:(6) Mexico is the
			 conduit for most of the cocaine—approximately 90 percent—in the United States,
			 the source for much of the heroin consumed in this country, and the largest
			 foreign supplier of marijuana and meth to other markets.
:(7) Estimates indicate
			 a vast majority of the cocaine available in the United States market is
			 smuggled by Mexican cartels across the United States-Mexico border.
:(8) Cartels are
			 becoming increasingly involved in the trafficking of meth because of the large
			 profit margins they obtain from controlling the drug from manufacture to
			 distribution.
:(9) The drug cartels
			 have criminal earnings in excess of $25 billion per year and physically send
			 more than $10 billion a year in bulk cash back into Mexico from the United
			 States.
:(10) According to the
			 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican drug trafficking organizations
			 are the greatest drug trafficking threat to the United States.
:(11) Mexico’s cartels
			 have existed for some time, but have become increasingly powerful in recent
			 years with the demise of once powerful cartels in Colombia and the closure of
			 trafficking routes through Florida.
:(12) The Colombian
			 cartels still play a role in the United States drug trade.
:(13) The [[Wikipedia:Drug Enforcement Administration|Drug
			 Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) maintains that the Mexican cartels now command
			 and control the drug trade and show the hallmarks of organized crime, such as
			 organizing into distinct cells with subordinate cells, including gangs, which
			 operate throughout the United States.
:(14) Mexican cartels
			 control drug distribution in most United States cities, and they are gaining
			 strength in markets that they do not yet control. The 2009 National Drug Threat
			 Assessment indicates that Mexican cartels maintain drug distribution networks
			 or supply drugs to distributors in at least 230 United States cities, including
			 in Alaska and Hawaii.
:(15) The Federal Government provides States and
			 local governments with assistance in covering the costs related to the fight
			 against the drug cartels and the prosecution of such drug cases, local law
			 enforcement along the border is in need of assistance in covering expenses.
			 Local law enforcement uses its limited resources to combat drug trafficking,
			 human smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, and other
			 border security related crimes. The United States shares 1,989 miles along its
			 border with Mexico. Federal assistance is required to help local law
			 enforcement.
