{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for the establishment of a mechanism to allow borrowers of private education loans to refinance their loans, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Refinancing Education Funding to Invest (REFI) for the Future Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) there is approximately $1,100,000,000,000 of outstanding student loan debt in the United States, including more than $150,000,000,000 in private education loans;
:(2) as of 2008, 81 percent of individuals graduating with an undergraduate degree with more than $40,000 in student loans had a private education loan;
:(3) the limited number of lenders in the private education loan marketplace reduce the ability of borrowers with private education loans to restructure, refinance, or negotiate repayment terms for their current loans, leading to excessive debt burdens and potential default; and
:(4) excessive student indebtedness reduces economic activity, threatens homeownership, hurts small business growth, and limits opportunities for economic expansion in rural communities.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to spur economic growth, by establishing a mechanism to allow borrowers of private education loans to refinance their loans in order—
:(1) to facilitate greater competition in the private education lending and refinancing markets;
:(2) to address inefficiencies in the private education lending and refinancing markets;
:(3) to encourage innovation in the private education refinancing markets; and
:(4) to promote the participation of private capital in the private education refinancing markets.

=Sec. 3. Definitions=

In this Act—
:(1) the term private education loan has the same meaning as in section 140(a) of the Truth in Lending Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1650 15 U.S.C. 1650(a)] ); and
:(2) the term Secretary means the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] , other than in the context of the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary of Education]] .

:(i) accommodate reasonable refinancing opportunities or other loan adjustments that—
::(I) improve the sustainability of payments for the borrower; and
::(II) reduce the likelihood of delinquency and default on private education loans;
:(ii) benefit borrowers that are most likely to have private student debt service obligations that represent a disproportionate share of their income; and

:(2) an outline of methodology and factors considered in the purchase or restructuring of private education loans;
:(3) private education loan modification options that may be available for existing loans;
:(4) how they will ensure that borrowers whose education debt service obligations represent a disproportionate share of their income will be provided relief; and
:(5) how the use of the methodology and factors, as proposed in the notice, will be used to ensure that any exercise of authority by the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] will result in no net cost to the Federal Government.
