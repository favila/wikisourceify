{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating February 28, 2013, as“Rare Disease Day”.    Whereas rare diseases and disorders are those that affect a small number of patients, typically less than 200,000 people in the United States;   Whereas, as of the date of approval of this resolution, nearly 7,000 rare diseases affect approximately 30,000,000 people in the United States and their families;   Whereas children with rare genetic diseases account for more than half of the population affected by rare diseases in the United States;   Whereas many rare diseases are serious, life-threatening, and lack an effective treatment;   Whereas rare diseases and conditions include epidermolysis bullosa, progeria, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, many childhood cancers, and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva;   Whereas people with rare diseases experience challenges that include difficulty in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, limited treatment options, and difficulty finding physicians or treatment centers with expertise in their diseases;   Whereas great strides have been made in research and treatment for rare diseases as a result of the  Orphan Drug Act ([[Public Law 97-414|Public Law 97–414]] ;96 Stat. 2049)and amendments made by that Act;   Whereas 2013 marks the 30th anniversary of the Orphan Drug Act and therefore a time to reflect upon the successes of that Act and the challenges to be addressed in the future;   Whereas both the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] and the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]] have established special offices to advocate for rare disease research and treatments;   Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an organization established in 1983 to provide services to, and advocate on behalf of, patients with rare diseases, was a primary force behind the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act and remains a critical public voice for people with rare diseases;   Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders sponsors Rare Disease Day in the United States to increase public awareness of rare diseases;   Whereas Rare Disease Day has become a global event occurring annually on the last day of February and was observed in more than 60 countries in 2012;   Whereas Rare Disease Day was observed in the United States for the first time on February 28, 2009; and   Whereas Rare Disease Day is anticipated to be observed globally for years to come, providing hope and information for rare disease patients around the world; Now, therefore, be it
