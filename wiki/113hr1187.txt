Not later than six months after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall establish a Northern Rockies Fish and Wildlife Habitat and Corridors Information Program.

==={{anchor|HD8429D5127F14B51B639BBC5B9577993}}(b) Purpose– ===

The purpose of the program is to—
:(1) support States and Indian tribes in the development of a regional information system database of fish and wildlife habitat and corridors that would inform planning and development decisions within the States of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming, enabling each State to model climate impacts and adaptation, and provide geographically specific enhancements of State wildlife action plans;
:(2) ensure the collaborative development, with the States and Indian tribes, of a comprehensive, regional geographic information system database of maps, models, data, surveys, informational products, and other geospatial information regarding fish and wildlife habitat and corridors, that—
::(A) is based on consistent protocols for sampling and mapping across landscapes that take into account regional differences; and
::(B) that utilizes—
:::(i) existing and planned State- and tribal-based geographic information system databases; and
:::(ii) existing databases, analytical tools, metadata activities, and other information products available through the National Biological Information Infrastructure maintained by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] and nongovernmental organizations; and
:(3) facilitate the use of such databases by Federal, State, local, and tribal decision makers to incorporate qualitative information on fish and wildlife habitat and corridors at the earliest possible stage to—
::(A) prioritize and target natural resources adaptation strategies and activities;
::(B) avoid, minimize, and mitigate the impacts on fish and wildlife habitat and corridors in siting energy development, water, transmission, transportation, and other land use projects;
::(C) assess the impacts of existing development on habitats and corridors; and
::(D) develop management strategies to enhance the ability of fish, wildlife, and plant species to migrate or respond to shifting habitats within existing habitats and corridors.

::(A) have been developed by Federal agencies, State wildlife agencies and natural heritage programs, Indian tribes, local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and industry; and
::(B) meet accepted Geospatial Interoperability Framework data and metadata protocols and standards;
:(2) include maps and descriptions of projected shifts in habitats and corridors of fish and wildlife species in response to climate change;
:(3) assure data quality and make the data, models, and analyses included in the System available at scales useful to decisionmakers—
::(A) to prioritize and target natural resources adaptation strategies and activities;
::(B) to assess the impacts of proposed energy development, water, transmission, transportation, and other land use projects and avoid, minimize, and mitigate those impacts on habitats and corridors;
::(C) to assess the impacts of existing development on habitats and corridors; and
::(D) to develop management strategies to enhance the ability of fish, wildlife, and plant species to migrate or respond to shifting habitats within existing habitats and corridors across the States of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming;
:(4) establish a process for updating maps and other information as landscapes, habitats, corridors, and wildlife populations change or as other information becomes available;
:(5) encourage the development of collaborative plans by Federal and State agencies and Indian tribes to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of the System to meet the needs of decisionmakers;
:(6) identify gaps in habitat and corridor information, mapping, and research that should be addressed to fully understand assess current data and metadata, and to prioritize research and future data collection activities for use in updating the System and provide support for those activities;
:(7) include mechanisms to support collaborative research, mapping, and planning of habitats and corridors by Federal and State agencies, Indian tribes, and other interested stakeholders;
:(8) incorporate biological and geospatial data on species and corridors found in energy development and transmission plans, including renewable energy initiatives, transportation, and other land use plans;
