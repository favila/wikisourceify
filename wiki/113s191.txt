The Federal regulatory system shall—
:(1) protect the public health, welfare, safety, and the environment of the United States, especially those promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation;
:(2) be based on the best available science and information;
:(3) allow for public participation and an open exchange of ideas;
:(4) promote predictability and reduce uncertainty, including adherence to a clearly articulated timeline for the release of regulatory documents at all stages of the regulatory process;
:(5) identify and use the best, most innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends;
:(6) take into account benefits and costs, both quantitative and qualitative;
:(7) ensure that regulations are accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to understand; and

=={{anchor|id3DD479582BD1421A870155AA0E1540D3}}(b) Requirements– ==

Each agency shall—
:(1) propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the regulation justify the costs of the regulation to the extent permitted by law;
:(2) tailor regulations of the agency to impose the least burden on society, consistent with obtaining regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other things, the costs of cumulative regulations;
:(3) select, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, those approaches that maximize net benefits, including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages, distributive impacts, and equity;
:(4) specify performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities are required to adopt;
:(5) identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees or marketable permits, or providing information upon which choices can be made by the public; and
:(6) use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated present and future benefits and costs.
