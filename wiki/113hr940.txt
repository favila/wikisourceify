{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
		  to protect rights of conscience with regard to requirements for coverage of
		  specific items and services, to amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit
		  certain abortion-related discrimination in governmental activities, and for
		  other purposes.


{{section|H0544E421B4704968ABC7AD3A80684217|1. Short title}}
This Act may be cited as the
			 
          Health Care Conscience Rights
			 Act

        
.

{{section|H0206CBB9437C4342A00A94E9C8C558FD|2. Findings}}
[[United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
(1)
As Thomas
			 Jefferson declared to New London Methodists in 1809, [n]o provision in
			 our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights
			 of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
.

(2)
Jefferson’s conviction on respect for
			 conscience is deeply embedded in the history and traditions of our Nation, and
			 codified in numerous Federal laws approved by congressional majorities and
			 Presidents of both parties, including in the Public Health Service Act
; the
			 United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act; the
			 Religious Freedom Restoration Act; longstanding provisions on respect for
			 conscience rights in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and District
			 of Columbia appropriations; and laws to protect individuals from being forced
			 to participate in Federal executions or prosecutions.

(3)
Following
			 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 (Public Law
			 111–148
, in this section referred to as PPACA
)
, the Federal
			 Government has sought to impose specific requirements that infringe on the
			 rights of conscience of those who offer or purchase health coverage.

(4)
While PPACA

			 provides an exemption for some religious groups that object to participation in
			 health insurance generally, and exempts millions of Americans from most of the
			 Act’s provisions, including the preventive services mandate, it fails to
			 provide statutory protection for those seeking to offer and purchase health
			 coverage who have a religious or moral objection only to specific items or
			 services.

(5)
Nurses and other
			 health care providers have increasingly been subjected to discrimination for
			 abiding by their conscience rather than providing, paying for, or referring for
			 abortion.

(6)
Conscience rights
			 protections for health care providers are an important part of civil rights
			 protections in Federal law and are indispensable to the continued viability of
			 the health care system in the United States. The increasingly significant
			 discrimination suffered by faith-based nonprofit health care providers risks
			 undermining access to high-quality compassionate care for some of the most
			 vulnerable populations in our country.

				individual to purchase individual health insurance coverage that includes
				coverage of an abortion or other item or service to which such individual has a
				moral or religious objection, or prevent an issuer from offering or issuing, to
				such individual, individual health insurance coverage that excludes such item
				or service;

(2)
require a sponsor
				(or, in the case of health insurance coverage offered to students through an
				institution of higher education, the institution of higher education offering
				such coverage) to sponsor, purchase, or provide any health benefits coverage or
				group health plan that includes coverage of an abortion or other item or
				service to which such sponsor or institution, respectively, has a moral or
				religious objection, or prevent an issuer from offering or issuing to such
				sponsor or institution, respectively, health insurance coverage that excludes
				such item or service;

(3)
require an issuer
				of health insurance coverage or the sponsor of a group health plan to include,

authorize the imposition of a tax, penalty,
				fee, fine, or other sanction, or the imposition of coverage of the item or

				pursuant to this section.

Aggregate
				actuarial value
Nothing in this section shall be construed to

				services.

(e)
Continued
				application of nondiscrimination rules
Nothing in this section
