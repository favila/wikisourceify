:(2)  “category of projects”means 2 or more projects related by project type, potential environmental impacts, geographic location, or another similar project feature or characteristic;
:(3)  “environmental assessment”means a concise public document for which a Federal agency is responsible that serves to—
::(A) briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact;

:(7)  “environmental document”means an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, and includes any supplemental document or document prepared pursuant to a court order;
:(8)  “finding of no significant impact”means a document by a Federal agency briefly presenting the reasons why a project, not otherwise subject to a categorical exclusion, will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared;

:(10)  “  NEPA  ”means the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/4321 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq].);

===(c) Preparation of environmental documents– ===

Upon the request of the lead agency, the project sponsor shall be authorized to prepare any document for purposes of an environmental review required in support of any project or approval by the lead agency if the lead agency furnishes oversight in such preparation and independently evaluates such document and the document is approved and adopted by the lead agency prior to taking any action or making any approval based on such document.

===(d) Adoption and use of documents– ===



====(1) Documents prepared under nepa– ====


:(A) Not more than 1 environmental impact statement and 1 environmental assessment shall be prepared under NEPA for a project (except for supplemental environmental documents prepared under NEPA or environmental documents prepared pursuant to a court order), and, except as otherwise provided by law, the lead agency shall prepare the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. After the lead agency issues a record of decision, no Federal agency responsible for making any approval for that project may rely on a document other than the environmental document prepared by the lead agency.
:(B) Upon the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency may adopt, use, or rely upon secondary and cumulative impact analyses included in any environmental document prepared under NEPA for projects in the same geographic area where the secondary and cumulative impact analyses provide information and data that pertains to the NEPA decision for the project under review.

====(2) State environmental documents; supplemental documents– ====


:(A) Upon the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency may adopt a document that has been prepared for a project under State laws and procedures as the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment for the project, provided that the State laws and procedures under which the document was prepared provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement that are substantially equivalent to NEPA .

::(i) a significant change has been made to the project that is relevant for purposes of environmental review of the project; or
::(ii) there have been significant changes in circumstances or availability of information relevant to the environmental review for the project.
:(D) If the agency prepares and publishes a supplemental document under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/560 subparagraph (C)], the lead agency may solicit comments from agencies and the public on the supplemental document for a period of not more than 45 days beginning on the date of the publication of the supplement.

====(3) Contemporaneous projects– ====

If the lead agency determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the project will have similar environmental impacts as a similar project in geographical proximity to the project, and that similar project was subject to environmental review or similar State procedures within the 5-year period immediately preceding the date that the lead agency makes that determination, the lead agency may adopt the environmental document that resulted from that environmental review or similar State procedure. The lead agency may adopt such an environmental document, if it is prepared under State laws and procedures only upon making a favorable determination on such environmental document pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/560 paragraph (2)(A)].

===(e) Participating agencies– ===



====(1) In general– ====

The lead agency shall be responsible for inviting and designating participating agencies in accordance with this subsection. The lead agency shall provide the invitation or notice of the designation in writing.

===(f) Project initiation request– ===



====(1) Notice– ====

A project sponsor shall provide the Federal agency responsible for undertaking a project with notice of the initiation of the project by providing a description of the proposed project, the general location of the proposed project, and a statement of any Federal approvals anticipated to be necessary for the proposed project, for the purpose of informing the Federal agency that the environmental review should be initiated.

====(2) Lead agency initiation– ====

The agency receiving a project initiation notice under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/560 paragraph (1)]shall promptly identify the lead agency for the project, and the lead agency shall initiate the environmental review within a period of 45 days after receiving the notice required by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/560 paragraph (1)]by inviting or designating agencies to become participating agencies, or, where the lead agency determines that no participating agencies are required for the project, by taking such other actions that are reasonable and necessary to initiate the environmental review.

===(g) Alternatives analysis– ===



====(1) Participation– ====

As early as practicable during the environmental review, but no later than during scoping for a project requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the lead agency shall provide an opportunity for involvement by cooperating agencies in determining the range of alternatives to be considered for a project.

Following participation under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/560 paragraph (1)], the lead agency shall determine the range of alternatives for consideration in any document which the lead agency is responsible for preparing for the project, subject to the following limitations:

=====(A) No evaluation of certain alternatives– =====

No Federal agency shall evaluate any alternative that was identified but not carried forward for detailed evaluation in an environmental document or evaluated and not selected in any environmental document prepared under NEPA for the same project.

=====(B) Only feasible alternatives evaluated– =====

Where a project is being constructed, managed, funded, or undertaken by a project sponsor that is not a Federal agency, Federal agencies shall only be required to evaluate alternatives that the project sponsor could feasibly undertake, consistent with the purpose of and the need for the project, including alternatives that can be undertaken by the project sponsor and that are technically and economically feasible.

====(3) Methodologies– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

The lead agency shall determine, in collaboration with cooperating agencies at appropriate times during the environmental review, the methodologies to be used and the level of detail required in the analysis of each alternative for a project. The lead agency shall include in the environmental document a description of the methodologies used and how the methodologies were selected.

=====(B) No evaluation of inappropriate alternatives– =====

When a lead agency determines that an alternative does not meet the purpose and need for a project, that alternative is not required to be evaluated in detail in an environmental document.

====(4) Preferred alternative– ====

At the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than other alternatives in order to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that the development of such higher level of detail will not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept another alternative which is being considered in the environmental review.

====(5) Employment analysis– ====
