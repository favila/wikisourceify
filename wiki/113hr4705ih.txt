{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1974 to authorize the Secretary of Defense to decontaminate certain portions of the former bombardment area on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico.   

=Section 1. Use of former bombardment area on island of Culebra, Puerto Rico=



==(a) Sense of congress– ==

It is the sense of Congress that the statutory prohibition restricting environmental cleanup of the former bombardment area on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico, is a unique anomaly for the [[w:|Department of Defense]]and its formerly used defense sites.

==(b) Modification of restriction on Federal decontamination authority– ==

   Section 204(c) of the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1974 ( [[Public Law 93-166|Public Law 93–166]]  ;87 Stat. 668)is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence:“The first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to the portions of the former bombardment area that were identified as having regular public access in the [[w:|Department of Defense]]study entitled“Study Relating to the Presence of Unexploded Ordnance in a Portion of the Former Naval Bombardment Area of Culebra Island, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico”and dated April 20, 2012, which was prepared in accordance with  section 2815 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 ([[Public Law 111-383|Public Law 111–383]] ;124 Stat. 4464).”.
