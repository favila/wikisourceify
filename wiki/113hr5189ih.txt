=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Energy and Water Research Integration Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Integrating energy and water research=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]]shall integrate water considerations into energy research, development, and demonstration programs and projects of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]by—
:(1) advancing energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices that meet the objectives of—
::(A) minimizing freshwater withdrawal and consumption;
::(B) increasing water use efficiency; and
::(C) utilizing nontraditional water sources with efforts to improve the quality of the water from those sources;
:(2) considering the effects climate variability may have on water supplies and quality for energy generation and fuel production; and
:(3) improving understanding of the energy-water nexus.

==(b) Strategic plan– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall develop a strategic plan identifying the research, development, and demonstration needs for [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]]programs and projects to carry out subsection (a). The strategic plan shall include technical milestones for achieving and assessing progress toward the objectives of subsection (a)(1).

===(2) Specific considerations– ===

In developing the strategic plan, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall consider—
:(A) new advanced cooling technologies for energy generation and fuel production technologies;
:(B) performance improvement of existing cooling technologies and cost reductions associated with using those technologies;
:(C) innovative water reuse, recovery, and treatment technologies in energy generation and fuel production;
:(D) technology development for carbon capture and storage systems that utilize efficient water use design strategies;
:(E) technologies that are life-cycle cost effective;
:(F) systems analysis and modeling of issues relating to the energy-water nexus;
:(G) technologies to treat and utilize wastewater and produced waters discharged from oil, natural gas, coalbed methane, and any other substance to be used as an energy source;
:(H) advanced materials for the use of nontraditional water sources for energy generation and fuel production;
:(I) biomass production and utilization and the impact on hydrologic systems;
:(J) technologies that reduce impacts on water from energy resource development;
:(K) energy efficient technologies for water distribution, treatment, and collection systems;
:(L) technologies for energy generation from water distribution, treatment, and collection systems; and
:(M) any other area of the energy-water nexus that the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]considers appropriate.

===(3) Collaboration and nonduplication– ===

In developing the strategic plan, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall coordinate and avoid duplication—
:(A) with other Federal agencies operating related programs, if appropriate; and
:(B) across programs and projects of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]], including with those of the National Laboratories.

===(4) Relevant information and recommendations– ===

In developing the strategic plan, the Secretary shall consider and incorporate, as appropriate, relevant information and recommendations, including those of the National Water Availability and Use Assessment Program under  section 9508(d) of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/10368 42 U.S.C. 10368(d)] ).

===(5) Additional participation– ===

In developing the strategic plan, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall consult and coordinate with a diverse group of representatives from research and academic institutions, industry, and State and local governments who have expertise in technologies and practices relating to the energy-water nexus.

===(6) Submission to Congress– ===

Not later than 15 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall submit to Congress the strategic plan.

===(7) Updating the strategic plan– ===

Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall—
:(A) utilize relevant information produced by Federal Government agencies, academia, States, and industry to update the strategic plan;
:(B) include in the updated strategic plan a description of the changes from the previous strategic plan and the rationale for such changes; and
:(C) submit the updated strategic plan to Congress.

==(c) Progress reports– ==

Not less frequently than once every 2 years, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall transmit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]a report on the progress the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]]has made toward the milestones outlined in the strategic plan.

==(d) Additional activities– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]may provide for such additional research, development, and demonstration activities as appropriate to integrate water considerations into the research, development, and demonstration activities of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]]as described in subsection (a). 

=Sec. 3. Energy-water oversight and coordination=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]], in coordination with other relevant Federal agencies, shall establish an [[w:United States Department of Energy|Energy-Water Subcommittee of the Energy Advisory Board]]to promote and enable improved energy and water resource data collection, reporting, and technological innovation. The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Subcommittee]]shall consist of—
:(1) representation from each program within the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]]and each Federal agency that conducts research related to the energy-water nexus; and
:(2) non-Federal members, including representatives of research and academic institutions, States, and industry, who have expertise in technologies and practices relating to the energy-water nexus.

==(b) Functions– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Subcommittee]]shall—
:(1) make recommendations on the development and integration of data collection and data communication standards and protocols to agencies and entities currently engaged in collecting the data for the energy-water nexus;
:(2) recommend ways to make improvements to Federal water use data to increase understanding of trends in energy generation and fuel production;
:(3) recommend best practices for utilizing information from existing monitoring networks to provide nationally uniform water and energy use and infrastructure data; and
:(4) conduct annual technical workshops, including at least 1 regional workshop annually, to facilitate information exchange among Federal, regional, State, local, and tribal governments and private sector experts on technologies that encourage the conservation and efficient use of water and energy.
