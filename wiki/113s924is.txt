{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to enhance existing programs providing mitigation assistance by encouraging States to adopt and actively enforce State building codes, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Safe Building Code Incentive Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) mitigation planning is the foundation for saving lives, protecting residential and commercial properties, and developing disaster resistant communities;
:(2) recent studies of the performance of building structures during disasters have demonstrated that the adoption and active enforcement of State building codes have greatly reduced residential and commercial property damage and personal injury resulting from major disasters;
:(3) modern building codes govern all aspects of construction and are designed to ensure that single-family residential dwellings and commercial structures are protected from natural disasters;
:(4) the people of the United States rely on active enforcement of modern building codes for assurance that minimum standards for reducing personal injuries and property damages have been met in the buildings they live in, work in, and visit everyday;
:(5) active enforcement of building codes plays an increasingly important role in public safety and loss prevention of residential and commercial property;
:(6) active enforcement of building codes based on nationally recognized models reduces the need for public disaster aid, creates sustainable communities, promotes a level and consistent playing field for design professionals, suppliers, and builders, and can contribute to the durability of residential and commercial structures;
:(7) under the  Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/5121 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.]), the [[w:Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] provides Federal assistance to States for mitigation efforts;
:(8) it is beneficial and appropriate to expand Federal mitigation assistance to encourage States to take a comprehensive and integrated approach to disaster loss reduction; and
:(9) it is beneficial to the Federal Government and appropriate that Federal mitigation assistance be used to encourage the adoption and active enforcement of State building codes as a disaster mitigation strategy under the auspices of a comprehensive disaster loss reduction plan. 

=Sec. 3. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to substantially mitigate the occurrence of loss to residential and commercial property, reduce and minimize damage when losses to residential and commercial property occur, improve the quality and value of residential and commercial property, and reduce the need for public disaster aid;
:(2) to provide incentives for the adoption and active enforcement of State building codes;
:(3) to encourage States to continue their key responsibility to coordinate all State and local activities relating to hazard evaluation and mitigation, as specified in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/201 section 201.3(c)]of title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, through the adoption and active enforcement of State building codes; and
:(4) to encourage States to require that local governments use a current version of a nationally applicable model building code that address natural hazards as a basis for design and construction of State-sponsored mitigation projects described insection 201.5(b)(4)(iv)of title 44, Code of Federal Regulations. 

=Sec. 4. Additional mitigation assistance=

   Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/5170c 42 U.S.C. 5170c])is amended by adding at the end the following:
