Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] or the head of any other Federal agency or department shall not regulate or continue to implement or enforce any regulations, proposals, or actions establishing any carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions reductions until the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] , the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Administrator of the Energy Information Agency]] , and the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] certify in writing that—
