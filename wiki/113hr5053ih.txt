{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to provide for the expedited removal of unaccompanied alien children who are not victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons and who do not have a fear of returning to their country of nationality or last habitual residence, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Expedited Family Reunification Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1)  
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]], on June 15, 2012, during the Rose Garden speech, announced a unilateral administrative change in United States immigration policy that the administration will not enforce broad swaths of immigration laws, including that the administration would not deport illegal immigrants brought to the United States as young children.
:(2) An estimated 90,000 unaccompanied alien children are likely to illegally enter the United States this year alone.
:(3) These children are targeted by human traffickers, drug cartels, and other criminal organizations, and run the risk of being kidnapped, raped, killed, or otherwise harmed.
:(4) Returning these illegal immigrants to their families in their home countries would allow them to be safe, free from harm, and help reduce future flow. 

=Sec. 3. Repatriation of unaccompanied alien children=
