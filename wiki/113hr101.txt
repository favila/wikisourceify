				pending under this chapter, unless the debtor certifies that the debtor
				attempted to contact the holder of such claim (or the entity collecting
				payments on behalf of such holder) regarding modification of the loan that is
				the subject of such claim, before—
::::(A) filing a plan
				under section 1321 that contains a modification under the authority of
				subsection (b)(11); or
::::(B) modifying a plan
				under section 1323 or 1329 to contain a modification under the authority of

				section 1322(b)(11) shall retain the lien until the later of—

::::(B) completion of all
				payments under the plan (or, if applicable, receipt of a discharge under
				section 1328(b)); and
:::(11) whenever the plan modifies a claim in
				accordance with section 1322(b)(11), the court finds that such modification is
				in good faith (Lack of good faith exists if the debtor has no need for relief
				under this paragraph because the debtor can pay all of his or her debts and any
				future payment increases on such debts without difficulty for the foreseeable
				future, including the positive amortization of mortgage debt. In determining
				whether a reduction of the principal amount of the loan resulting from a
				modification made under the authority of section 1322(b)(11) is made in good
				faith, the court shall consider whether the holder of such claim (or the entity
				collecting payments on behalf of such holder) has offered to the debtor a
				qualified loan modification that would enable the debtor to pay such debts and
				such loan without reducing such principal amount.) and does not find that the
				debtor has been convicted of obtaining by actual fraud the extension, renewal,
				or refinancing of credit that gives rise to a modified
				claim..

<blockquote>
::(d) Notwithstanding section 1322(b)(11)(C)(ii),
				the court, on request of the debtor or the holder of a claim secured by a
				senior security interest in the debtor’s principal residence, may confirm a
				plan proposing a reduction in the interest rate on the loan secured by such
				security interest and that does not reduce the principal, provided the total
				monthly mortgage payment is reduced to a percentage of the debtor's income in
				accordance with the guidelines of the Obama Administration’s Homeowner
				Affordability and Stability Plan as implemented March 4, 2009, if, taking into
				account the debtor's financial situation, after allowance of expenses that

				paragraph, and taking into account additional debts and fees that are to be

				rate without such reduction in
				principal..
