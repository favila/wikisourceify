{{Center|A BILL}}

To prevent implementation and enforcement of Obamacare.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “No IRS Implementation of Obamacare Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Between March 2010 and May 2012, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] (hereafter referred to as the “IRS” ) engaged in specific targeting of conservative groups that submitted 501(c)(4) applications.
:(2) IRS employees searched terms such as “patriots” and “tea party” and purposefully singled out these small-government organizations for additional scrutiny and delay.
:(3) The [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] sat on applications from over 75 conservative groups for months, and in some cases, even years while sending them exhaustive questionnaires delaying their approval for as long as possible.
:(4) This blatant breach of the public’s trust and misuse of taxpayer money runs counter to the core function of the IRS to collect taxes from U.S. citizens regardless of their political affiliations.
:(5) The [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] is responsible for implementing the tax increases of Obamacare.
:(6) The [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] will make the final decisions of who is eligible for subsidies after sharing taxpayer information with the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] .
:(7) A healthy democracy is one where people feel free to express their views, not one where Federal agencies discriminate based on political beliefs.

=Sec. 3. Prevention of implementation and enforcement of Obamacare by IRS=

The [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] , or any delegate of the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] , shall not implement or enforce any provisions of[[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]] ]] and[[Public Law 111-152|Public Law 111–152]] (other than[[Public Law 111-152|subtitle A of title II thereof]] ).

=Sec. 4. Prevention of use of taxpayer funds to implement or enforce Obamacare=

No taxpayer funds shall be used for the implementation or enforcement of[[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]] ]] and[[Public Law -|[[Public Law 111-152|Public Law 111–152]] ]] (other than[[Public Law 111-152|subtitle A of title II thereof]] ).
