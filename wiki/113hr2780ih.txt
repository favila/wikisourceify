{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide assistance for developing countries to promote quality basic education and to establish the achievement of quality universal basic education in all developing countries as an objective of United States foreign assistance policy, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Education for All Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Throughout the world, an alarming number of children and youth are not receiving a basic education. According to the Global Monitoring Report, approximately 57,000,000 children of primary school age are not in school and tens of millions drop out of school annually. Globally, progress is slowing, and if current trends continue, there could be as many as 72,000,000 children of primary school age out of school in 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, the number of primary age children out of school has remained at approximately 30,000,000 over the past five years. Additionally, there were an estimated 69,000,000 adolescents not enrolled in school in 2011 and an estimated 122,000,000 youth (15 to 24 years old) who could not read and write in 2010, needing a second chance to acquire even basic literacy and numeracy skills.
:(2) Of the approximately 57,000,000 children of primary school age and 69,000,000 adolescents of lower secondary school age who were not in school in 2011, 53 percent were girls. The proportion of out-of-school primary age girls is highest in Arab states, Central Asia, South and West Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Over half of the world’s out-of-school children live in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 28,000,000 live in countries affected by conflict. A significant number of such children have been orphaned or otherwise negatively affected by HIV/AIDS, while others have been victims of child labor or human trafficking. Of the estimated 120,000,000 to 150,000,000 children with disabilities under the age of 18 around the world, an estimated 98 percent of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school. Without access to quality education, such children will not have the skills to contribute to reconstruction and stabilization of their countries.
:(3) The final report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Report” ) concluded that education that teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and respect for different beliefs must be a key element in any global strategy to eliminate terrorism. The Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Commission on Smart Power determined that “education is the best hope of turning young people away from violence and extremism” .
:(4) The vision for educational opportunity described in the Report to all developing countries, including countries affected by armed conflict, is critical to achieve the Education for All Goals and prevent the rise of violent extremism worldwide.
:(5) The Report concluded that the United States Government must offer an example of moral leadership in the world and offer parents and their children a vision of the future that emphasizes individual educational and economic opportunity.
:(6) The Report noted that the United Nations has rightly equated “literacy as freedom” , and while gains have been made in Arab states in reducing the out-of-school population, an estimated 25 percent of the adult population in the Arab states, or 50,286,000 people, lack basic literacy or numeracy skills needed in everyday life.
:(7) The Report concluded that ensuring educational opportunity is essential to the efforts of the United States to defeat global terrorism.
:(8) At the World Education Forum held in Dakar, Senegal, in 2000, the United States joined more than 180 other countries in committing to the 6 Education For All goals, including quality universal basic education.
:(9) Since the World Education Forum in 2000, the number of children out of school has decreased at an average approximate rate of more than 4,090,000 children per year. Despite this progress, the goal of achieving quality universal basic education will not be met, and 72,000,000 children may still be out of school by 2015, while millions of children in school are not acquiring foundational skills in literacy and numeracy.
:(10) In fiscal year 2012, the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development’s]] bilateral assistance helped to deliver a quality basic education to approximately 23,000,000 learners enrolled in United States Government-supported primary and secondary schools around the world. USAID has expertise in a number of key areas, including teacher training, reaching marginalized groups and quality measurement and has provided technical assistance to governments in order to create sustainable educational systems.
:(11) Basic education is fundamental to development. No country has reached sustained economic growth without achieving near universal primary education. Quality education reduces poverty and inequity, lays the foundation for sound governance, civic participation, and strong institutions, and equips people with the knowledge, skills, and self-reliance they need to increase income and expand opportunities for employment.
:(12) Investing in girls’ education and skills building programs not only delivers substantial returns in educational attainment but also empowers girls to address conditions of poverty, low status, and social norms by increasing women’s and household incomes, delaying the start of sexual activity, reducing infant mortality, increasing women’s political participation, spurring economic growth, and delaying marriage.
:(13) Education can help to protect children in conflict situations from physical harm, exploitation, and sexual abuse, as well as to avoid the recruitment of children into armed groups and gangs, and promote good governance and poverty reduction. Additionally, every additional year of schooling for males can reduce their risk of becoming involved in conflict by 20 percent.
:(14) In front line states, education remains a significant challenge. Of the 57,000,000 children of primary school age who are out of school, 28,000,000, or 42 percent, are in conflict-affected poor countries. In Yemen, nearly 80 percent of girls are unlikely to enroll in school, and in Afghanistan, girls average only 4 years of schooling.
:(15) Multilateral mechanisms have been proven to marshal critical resources to reach global development challenges. Funds that are transparent, increase partnership and coordination among governments, private sector, and civil society, support national plans, are monitored for results, and hold all stakeholders accountable have been effective at providing resources to reach global challenges.
