{{Center|A BILL}}

 To promote the provision of telehealth by establishing a Federal standard for telehealth, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Telehealth Modernization Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Telehealth technologies can transform health care delivery by improving access to quality care by removing traditional barriers to health care delivery such as distance, mobility, and time constraints.
:(2) Telehealth is a mode of delivering health care utilizing information and communication technologies to enable the diagnosis, consultation, treatment, and care management of patients by health care providers.
:(3) The use of information and telecommunication technologies to deliver health care has the potential to reduce costs, improve quality, change conditions of practice, and improve access to health care, particularly in rural and medically underserved areas.
:(4) A lack of primary care providers, specialty providers, and transportation continues to be a significant barrier to access to health care in medically underserved rural and urban areas.
:(5) Parts of the nation have difficulty attracting and retaining health professionals, as well as supporting local health facilities to provide a continuum of health care.
:(6) Many health care providers in medically underserved areas are isolated from mentors, colleagues, and the information resources necessary to support them personally and professionally.
:(7) A patchwork of state regulatory environments poses legal and regulatory hurdles that are inhibiting the proliferation of private-sector telehealth innovations and have created significant uncertainty for the telehealth community.
:(8) As of June 2013, 40 out of 50 states have introduced legislation addressing telehealth policy, with wide variations in how telehealth is defined.
:(9) To help clarify this uncertainty and provide States with appropriate guidance, Congress should provide a workable Federal definition of telehealth that ensures the highest common denominator of care while facilitating future innovation.
:(10) The fundamental health care provider-patient relationship cannot only be preserved through a Federal definition of telehealth, but also can be established, augmented, and enhanced through the use of telehealth.

===(2) Identification of underlying conditions and contraindications– ===

To the extent practicable, the health care professional should attempt to identify the conditions underlying the symptoms, if any, reported by the individual before such professional provides any diagnosis or treatment to the individual.
