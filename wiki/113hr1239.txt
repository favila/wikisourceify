===(F) Inclusion of negotiated price of drugs provided under compassionate treatment programs===


====(i) In general====

In applying subparagraph (A) with respect to an individual enrolled in a prescription drug plan, incurred costs shall include the negotiated price described in clause (ii) of a covered part D drug if—: the drug is classified, for purposes of applying tiered copayments consistent with section 1860D–2(b)(2)(B) , in the highest copayment tier (such as a tier 4 for specialty brand-name drugs);: the drug is furnished to the individual free or at nominal charge under a compassionate treatment program (as defined in clause (iii) ); and: the drug, if furnished other than through such program, is covered under the formulary of the plan or is available through exception or appeal.
====(ii) Negotiated price====

The negotiated price described in this clause, for a covered part D drug which is dispensed to an enrollee—: by a pharmacy, is the negotiated price at such pharmacy; or: other than by a pharmacy, is the average negotiated price for the drug in the prescription drug plan in the zip code of the enrollee as of the date the drug is dispensed.
====(iii) Compassionate treatment program defined====

In this subparagraph, the term compassionate treatment program means, with respect to covered part D drugs, a program that—: is administered by an entity described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that is exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code ;: takes title to the drugs and distributes the drugs to eligible part D individuals free or at nominal charge on the basis of the entity’s assessment of financial need of such individuals;: does not distribute the drugs to an individual unless the individual’s household income (as determined under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ) is less than the maximum income level for the taxpayer in the household to be eligible for a refundable credit under such section; and: meets such additional requirements as the [[Wikipedia:|Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ]]establishes, consistent with guidance and advisory opinions issued under section 1128D , to prevent fraud or abuse in the application of this subparagraph..
