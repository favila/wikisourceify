      Findings
      
        
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             finds the following:
			
        (1)
        Students must be
			 prepared in core academic subjects.
			
      
        (2)
        Students must
			 possess the skills to be able to think critically and solve problems, be
			 effective communicators, collaborate with others, and learn to create and
			 innovate.
			
      
        (3)
        In order for
			 students in the United States to be prepared to succeed in citizenship and
			 workplaces of the present and future, core academic subjects must be fused with
			 critical thinking and problem solving, communication, collaboration, and
			 creativity and innovation skills, as such skills are critical for success in
			 the 21st century.
			
      
        (4)
        The work of the
			 National Governors Association, along with the Council of Chief State School
			 Officers, in developing a set of voluntary and internationally benchmarked
			 national common standards in mathematics and English that include rigorous
			 content and 21st century skills, is a positive development and should serve as
			 a basis for incorporating those skills and other critical skills throughout
			 other core academic subjects in the future. Federal policy must support State
			 leadership and encourage continued State innovation.
