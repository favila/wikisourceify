The [[w:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Task Force]] concludes that the current evidence is sufficient to assess the balance of benefits and risks of the product or service, and, on the basis of such evidence, recommends the product or service and determines that there is high certainty that the net benefit of the product or service is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit of the product or service is moderate to substantial.

Recommendations against a preventive service shall only be issued in concurrence with the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] after consultation with other Federal health agencies and relevant patient and provider groups.

======(v) Grade I– ======

The [[w:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Task Force]] concludes that the current evidence is not sufficient to assess the balance of benefits and risks of the product or service.

=====(E) Changes in grading system– =====



======(i) In general– ======

The [[w:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Director]] may provide, by regulation, for changes in the grading system described in subparagraph (D).
