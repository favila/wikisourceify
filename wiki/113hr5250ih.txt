{{Center|A BILL}}

 To use Federal purchasing power to create good jobs, rebuild the middle class, address income inequality, stimulate the economy, and to achieve other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Restore Opportunity, Strengthen, and Improve the Economy Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress of the United States]]finds the following:
:(1) The disappearance of good jobs, the shrinking of the middle class, and growing income inequality are the greatest domestic challenges confronting the Nation.
:(2) The United States Government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the Nation’s private-sector economy, spending over $1.5 trillion dollars annually at firms that employ a quarter of American workers.
:(3) 
::(A) Federal purchasing power is currently creating millions of poverty-level jobs, subsidizing labor law-breakers, and funding ballooning executive compensation.
::(B) The Federal Government is the Nation’s leading creator of low-wage jobs in the private sector, funding more than 2,000,000 jobs paying under $12 per hour.
::(C) The Federal Government awards taxpayer dollars to a substantial number of firms that violate Federal labor, employment, and occupational safety laws.
::(D) Federal Government purchasing subsidizes the excessive salaries of private-sector executives who do business with the American people.
:(4) When Federal purchasing power is used in such a manner, workers have less to spend on the necessities of life and are forced to rely on public assistance. Lack of working purchasing power hurts job creation and undermines economic growth, ultimately imposing significant costs on American taxpayers.
:(5) 
::(A) Federal purchasing power should be used to create good jobs, rebuild the middle class, and curb rising income inequality.
::(B) Federal purchasing power should be used to create good jobs for America. Good jobs allow workers and their families to live in dignity without relying on public assistance or private charity. Good jobs pay enough to provide for subsistence, health care, education, housing, and savings, as well as enough disposable income to allow workers to enjoy quality time off with their loved ones.
::(C) Federal purchasing power should be used to rebuild the middle class. A strong middle class stimulates the economy by increasing consumer spending and job growth.
::(D) Federal purchasing power should be used to narrow the growing gulf between the richest one percent of the population and ordinary working families that is threatening the survival of participatory democracy.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are the following:
:(1) To use Federal purchasing power to incentivize private-sector firms.
:(2) To create good jobs for America’s workers.
:(3) To rebuild America’s middle class.
:(4) To address America’s crisis of income inequality.
:(5) To invigorate the economy by increasing the purchasing power of working Americans. 

=Sec. 3. Good jobs model employer standards=

For purposes of this Act, a Good Jobs Model Employer is one which meets the following standards:
:(1) Respects employees’ rights to bargain collectively with their employers without being forced to take strike action to win better wages and working conditions.
:(2) Offers to each employee living wages, decent benefits including health care, paid leave for sickness and caregiving, and fair work schedules that are predictable and stable.
:(3) Affirmatively demonstrates an exemplary standard of compliance with workplace protection laws, including laws governing labor relations, wages and hours, and health and safety, as well as other applicable labor laws.
:(4) Limits executive compensation to 50 times the median salary paid to the company’s workers.
:(5) Employs a workforce not less than 35 percent of which reside within one or more Historically Underutilized Business Zones.
:(6) Subcontracts only with other Good Jobs Model Employers. 

=Sec. 4. Application to Federal contracts and assistance=



==(a) Eligibility for award of procurement contracts– ==

==(b) Eligibility for award of financial and nonfinancial assistance– ==

An executive agency may not provide other forms of financial or nonfinancial assistance to entities that are not model employers when there is a similarly situated Good Jobs Model Employer that could receive the assistance, unless doing so would substantially undermine the value of the assistance to the public good.

==(c) Incorporation into future Federal contracts and assistance agreements– ==
