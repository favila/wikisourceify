{{Center|A BILL}}

To require the Attorney General to disclose each decision, order, or opinion of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that includes significant legal interpretation of section 501 or 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 unless such disclosure is not in the national security interest of the United States and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Ending Secret Law Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Secret law is inconsistent with democratic governance. In order for the rule of law to prevail, the requirements of the law must be publicly discoverable.
:(2) The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated in 1998 that the “idea of secret laws is repugnant”.
:(3) The open publication of laws and directives is a defining characteristic of government of the United States. The first Congress of the United States mandated that every <nowiki>law, order, resolution, and vote [shall] be published in at least three of the public newspapers printed within the United States</nowiki> .
:(4) The practice of withholding decisions of the [[w:|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] is at odds with the United States tradition of open publication of law.
:(5) The [[w:|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] acknowledges that such Court has issued legally significant interpretations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.] ] )that are not accessible to the public.
:(6) The exercise of surveillance authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801 50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.] ] ), as interpreted by secret court opinions, potentially implicates the communications of United States persons who are necessarily unaware of such surveillance.
:(7)  Section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1861 50 U.S.C. 1861] ] ), as amended by section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act([[Public Law -|[[Public Law 107-56|Public Law 107–56]] ]] ;115 Stat. 287), authorizes the [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation]] to require the production of any tangible things and the extent of such authority, as interpreted by secret court opinions, has been concealed from the knowledge and awareness of the people of the United States.
:(8) In 2010, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[w:|Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] established a process to review and declassify opinions of the [[w:|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] , but more than two years later no declassifications have been made.

=Sec. 3. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that each decision, order, or opinion issued by the [[w:|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]] or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review that includes significant construction or interpretation of section 501or section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1861 50 U.S.C. 1861] and [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a 1881a] ) should be declassified in a manner consistent with the protection of national security, intelligence sources and methods, and other properly classified and sensitive information.
