{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for programs and activities with respect to the prevention of underage drinking.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Reauthorization Act”or the“STOP Act”.

=Sec. 2. Amendment to the Public Health Service Act=

 Section 519B of the Public Health Service Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/290bb–25b 42 U.S.C. 290bb–25b] )is amended by striking subsections (a) through (f)and inserting the following:

<blockquote>

==(a) Definitions– ==

For purposes of this section:
:(1) The term alcohol beverage industry means the brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, distributors, and retail or online outlets that sell or serve beer, wine, and distilled spirits.
:(2) The term school-based prevention means programs, which are institutionalized, and run by staff members or school-designated persons or organizations in any grade of school, kindergarten through 12th grade.
:(3) The term youth means persons under the age of 21.

==(b) Sense of congress– ==

It is the sense of the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that:
:(1) A multi-faceted effort is needed to more successfully address the problem of underage drinking in the United States. A coordinated approach to prevention, intervention, treatment, enforcement, and research is key to making progress. This section recognizes the need for a focused national effort, and addresses particulars of the Federal portion of that effort, as well as Federal support for State activities.
:(2) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall continue to conduct research and collect data on the short- and long-range impact of alcohol use and abuse upon adolescent brain development and other organ systems.
:(3) States and communities, including colleges and universities, are encouraged to adopt comprehensive prevention approaches, including—
::(A) evidence-based screening, programs, and curricula;
::(B) brief intervention strategies;
::(C) consistent policy enforcement; and
::(D) science-based strategies to reduce underage drinking.
:(4) Public health groups, consumer groups, and the alcohol beverage industry should continue and expand evidence-based efforts to prevent and reduce underage drinking.
:(5) The entertainment industries have a powerful impact on youth, and they should use rating systems and marketing codes to reduce the likelihood that underage audiences will be exposed to movies, recordings, television programs, or other digital media with unsuitable alcohol content.
:(6) The National Collegiate Athletic Association, its member colleges and universities, and athletic conferences should affirm a commitment to a policy of discouraging alcohol use among underage students and other young fans.
:(7) Alcohol is a unique product and should be regulated differently than other products by the States and Federal Government. States have primary authority to regulate alcohol distribution and sale, and the Federal Government should support and supplement these State efforts. States also have a responsibility to fight youth access to alcohol and reduce underage drinking. Continued State regulation and licensing of the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages are clearly in the public interest and are critical to promoting responsible consumption, preventing illegal access to alcohol by persons under 21 years of age from commercial and non-commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity and an orderly marketplace, and furthering effective State tax collection.
:(8) The age-21 minimum drinking law, enacted in 1984, has been a remarkably effective public health and safety policy, as evidenced by the fact that the percentage of 12th graders who have drunk alcohol in the past month has fallen by one-third since the enactment of such law.
:(9) The age-21 minimum drinking law has also has been significantly effective in reducing drinking and driving traffic fatalities, as the [[w:National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) estimates that the law has saved over 28,000 lives since 1975.
:(10) Community awareness, support, and mobilization provide an important context for the effective enforcement of the age-21 minimum drinking law.
