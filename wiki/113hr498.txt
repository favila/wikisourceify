This Act may be cited as the
			 “Sober Truth on Preventing Underage
			 Drinking Reauthorization Act” or the “STOP Act”.

={{anchor|HABFB785FE47C4C41A6452FA24CEDA036}}Sec. 2. Amendment to the
			 Public Health Service Act=

Section 519B of the Public Health Service
			 Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb–25b) is amended by striking subsections (a) through (f)
			 and inserting the following:

<blockquote>

=={{anchor|H28253E5ED38A42118DD8E37A6BD5A4ED}}(a) Definitions– ==

For
				purposes of this section:
:(1) The term
				alcohol beverage industry means the brewers, vintners, distillers,
				importers, distributors, and retail or online outlets that sell or serve beer,
				wine, and distilled spirits.
:(2) The term
				school-based prevention means programs, which are
				institutionalized, and run by staff members or school-designated persons or
				organizations in any grade of school, kindergarten through 12th grade.
:(3) The term
				youth means persons under the age of 21.

=={{anchor|H9D88CF2D8DAE4554951961092807F9B3}}(b) Sense of
				congress– ==

It is the sense of the [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] that:
:(1) A multi-faceted
				effort is needed to more successfully address the problem of underage drinking
				in the United States. A coordinated approach to prevention, intervention,
				treatment, enforcement, and research is key to making progress. This section
				recognizes the need for a focused national effort, and addresses particulars of
				the Federal portion of that effort, as well as Federal support for State
				activities.
:(2) The [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
				shall continue to conduct research and collect data on the short- and
				long-range impact of alcohol use and abuse upon adolescent brain development
				and other organ systems.
:(3) States and
				communities, including colleges and universities, are encouraged to adopt
				comprehensive prevention approaches, including—
::(A) evidence-based
				screening, programs, and curricula;
::(B) brief intervention
				strategies;
::(C) consistent policy
				enforcement; and
::(D) science-based
				strategies to reduce underage drinking.
:(4) Public health
				groups, consumer groups, and the alcohol beverage industry should continue and
				expand evidence-based efforts to prevent and reduce underage drinking.
:(5) The entertainment
				industries have a powerful impact on youth, and they should use rating systems
				and marketing codes to reduce the likelihood that underage audiences will be
				exposed to movies, recordings, television programs, or other digital media with
				unsuitable alcohol content.
:(6) The National
				Collegiate Athletic Association, its member colleges and universities, and
				athletic conferences should affirm a commitment to a policy of discouraging
				alcohol use among underage students and other young fans.
:(7) Alcohol is a
				unique product and should be regulated differently than other products by the
				States and Federal Government. States have primary authority to regulate
				alcohol distribution and sale, and the Federal Government should support and
				supplement these State efforts. States also have a responsibility to fight
				youth access to alcohol and reduce underage drinking. Continued State
				regulation and licensing of the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution,
				transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages are clearly in the public
				interest and are critical to promoting responsible consumption, preventing
				illegal access to alcohol by persons under 21 years of age from commercial and
				non-commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity and an orderly
				marketplace, and furthering effective State tax collection.
:(8) The age-21 minimum
				drinking law, enacted in 1984, has been a remarkably effective public health
				and safety policy, as evidenced by the fact that the percentage of 12th graders
				who have drunk alcohol in the past month has fallen by one-third since the
				enactment of such law.
:(9) The age-21 minimum
				drinking law has also has been significantly effective in reducing drinking and
				driving traffic fatalities, as the [[Wikipedia:National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|National Highway Traffic Safety
				Administration]] (NHTSA) estimates that the law has saved over 28,000 lives since
				1975.
:(10) Community
				awareness, support, and mobilization provide an important context for the
				effective enforcement of the age-21 minimum drinking law.
