===A Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act– ===



===Sec. 2001. Purpose===

The purpose of this title is to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, this subtitle will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them. Moreover, as a tax on carbon emissions increases energy costs on consumers, reduces economic growth and is therefore detrimental to individuals, families and businesses, this subtitle includes in the definition of a major rule, any rule that implements or provides for the imposition or collection of a tax on carbon emissions.

  Chapter 29of title 35, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

<blockquote> 

=====Sec. 299A. Discovery in patent infringement action=====



======(a) Discovery in patent infringement action– ======

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), in a civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, if the court determines that a ruling relating to the construction of terms used in a patent claim asserted in the complaint is required, discovery shall be limited, until such ruling is issued, to information necessary for the court to determine the meaning of the terms used in the patent claim, including any interpretation of those terms used to support the claim of infringement.

======(b) Discretion To expand scope of discovery– ======



=======(1) Timely resolution of actions– =======

In the case of an action under any provision of Federal law (including an action that includes a claim for relief arising under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271 section 271(e)]), for which resolution within a specified period of time of a civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents will necessarily affect the rights of a party with respect to the patent, the court shall permit discovery, in addition to the discovery authorized under subsection (a), before the ruling described in subsection (a) is issued as necessary to ensure timely resolution of the action.

=======(2) Resolution of motions– =======

When necessary to resolve a motion properly raised by a party before a ruling relating to the construction of terms described in subsection (a) is issued, the court may allow limited discovery in addition to the discovery authorized under subsection (a) as necessary to resolve the motion.

=======(3) Special circumstances– =======

In special circumstances that would make denial of discovery a manifest injustice, the court may permit discovery, in addition to the discovery authorized under subsection (a), as necessary to prevent the manifest injustice.

=======(4) Actions seeking relief based on competitive harm– =======

The limitation on discovery provided under subsection (a) shall not apply to an action seeking a preliminary injunction to redress harm arising from the use, sale, or offer for sale of any allegedly infringing instrumentality that competes with a product sold or offered for sale, or a process used in manufacture, by a party alleging infringement.

======(c) Exclusion from discovery limitation– ======

The parties may voluntarily consent to be excluded, in whole or in part, from the limitation on discovery provided under subsection (a) if at least one plaintiff and one defendant enter into a signed stipulation, to be filed with and signed by the court.

It is the sense of Congress that it is an abuse of the patent system and against public policy for a party to send out purposely evasive demand letters to end users alleging patent infringement. Demand letters sent should, at the least, include basic information about the patent in question, what is being infringed, and how it is being infringed. Any actions or litigation that stem from these types of purposely evasive demand letters to end users should be considered a fraudulent or deceptive practice and an exceptional circumstance when considering whether the litigation is abusive.

==Title IV— Preserving Access to Abundant and Affordable Sources of Energy==



===A Northern Route Approval– ===



===Sec. 4101. Findings===

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) To maintain our Nation’s competitive edge and ensure an economy built to last, the United States must have fast, reliable, resilient, and environmentally sound means of moving energy. In a global economy, we will compete for the world’s investments based in significant part on the quality of our infrastructure. Investing in the Nation’s infrastructure provides immediate and long-term economic benefits for local communities and the Nation as a whole.
:(2) The delivery of oil from Canada, a close ally not only in proximity but in shared values and ideals, to domestic markets is in the national interest because of the need to lessen dependence upon insecure foreign sources.
:(3) The Keystone XL pipeline would provide both short-term and long-term employment opportunities and related labor income benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes.
:(4) The State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will have minimal environmental impacts.
:(5) The [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]and other Federal agencies have over a long period of time conducted extensive studies and analysis of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, and—
::(A) the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]assessments found that the Keystone XL pipeline“is not likely to impact the amount of crude oil produced from the oil sands”and that“approval or denial of the proposed project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands”;
::(B) the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]found that incremental life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, with the upper end of this range representing twelve one-thousandths of one percent of the 6,702 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the United States in 2011; and
::(C) after extensive evaluation of potential impacts to land and water resources along the Keystone XL pipeline’s 875 mile proposed route, the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]found that“The analyses of potential impacts associated with construction and normal operation of the proposed Project suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with all laws and required conditions and measures).”.
:(6) The transportation of oil via pipeline is the safest and most economically and environmentally effective means of doing so, and—
::(A) transportation of oil via pipeline has a record of unmatched safety and environmental protection, and the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]found that“Spills associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment expected to be rare and relatively small”, and that“there is no evidence of increased corrosion or other pipeline threat due to viscosity”of diluted bitumen oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL pipeline; and
::(B) plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special conditions related to the design, construction, and operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]to find that the pipeline will have“a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline”.
:(7) The Keystone XL is in much the same position today as the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 prior to congressional action. Once again, the Federal regulatory process remains an insurmountable obstacle to a project that is likely to reduce oil imports from insecure foreign sources.

===Sec. 4102. Keystone XL permit approval===

:(2) the constitutionality of any provision of this subtitle, or any decision or action taken, made, granted, or issued, or deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under this subtitle; or
:(3) the adequacy of any environmental impact statement prepared under the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/4321 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] ), or of any analysis under any other Act, with respect to any action taken, made, granted, or issued, or deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under this subtitle.

===Sec. 4104. American burying beetle===



====(a) Findings– ====

The Congress finds that—
:(1) environmental reviews performed for the Keystone XL pipeline project satisfy the requirements of  section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1536 16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)] )in its entirety; and
:(2) for purposes of that Act, the Keystone XL pipeline project will not jeopardize the continued existence of the American burying beetle or destroy or adversely modify American burying beetle critical habitat.

====(b) Biological opinion– ====

The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]is deemed to have issued a written statement setting forth the Secretary’s opinion containing such findings under  section 7(b)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1536 16 U.S.C. 1536(b)(1)(A)] )and any taking of the American burying beetle that is incidental to the construction or operation and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline as it may be ultimately defined in its entirety, shall not be considered a prohibited taking of such species under such Act.

===Sec. 4105. Right-of-way and temporary use permit===
