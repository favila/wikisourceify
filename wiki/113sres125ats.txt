{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating April 30, 2013, as Día de los Niños: Celebrating Young Americans .    Whereas many countries throughout the world, and especially within the Western hemisphere, celebrate Día de los Niños , or Day of the Children , on April 30 each year, in recognition and celebration of the future of their country—their children;   Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the people of the United States and children are the center of families in the United States;   Whereas the people of the United States should nurture and invest in children to preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the spirit of the United States;   Whereas, according to the 2011 American Community Survey by the [[w:Bureau of the Census|Bureau of the Census]], approximately 17,400,000 of the nearly 52,000,000 individuals of Hispanic descent living in the United States are children under the age of 18, representing more than 33 percent of the total Hispanic population residing in the United States;   Whereas Hispanics, the youngest and fastest growing ethnic community in the United States, continue the tradition of honoring their children on Día de los Niños, and wish to share this custom with the rest of the United States;   Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, and culture are parents and family members, and children are responsible for passing on family values, morality, and culture to future generations;   Whereas the importance of literacy and education is most often communicated to children through their family members;   Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family and community activities that include extended and elderly family members and encourage children to explore and develop confidence;   Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of the United States will help affirm the significance of family, education, and community for the people of the United States;   Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for the children of the United States will provide an opportunity for children to reflect on their future, articulate their aspirations, and find comfort and security in the support of their family members and communities;   Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout the United States to declare April 30, 2013, to be Día de los Niños: Celebrating Young Americans , a day to bring together Hispanics and other communities in the United States to celebrate and uplift children; and   Whereas the children of a country are the responsibility of all of the people of that country, and people should be encouraged to celebrate the gifts of children to society: Now, therefore, be it
