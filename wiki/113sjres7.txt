Any bill that imposes a new tax
				or increases the statutory rate of any tax or the aggregate amount of revenue
				may pass only by a two-thirds majority of the duly chosen and sworn Members of
				each House of Congress by a roll call vote. For the purpose of determining any
				increase in revenue under this section, there shall be excluded any increase
				resulting from the lowering of the statutory rate of any tax.

={{anchor|id67fb401dc3a24c05b7d762caf039f03c}}5. =

				imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by
				three-fifths of the duly chosen and sworn Members of each House of Congress by
				a roll call vote. Such suspension must identify and be limited to the specific
				excess of outlays for that fiscal year made necessary by the identified
				military conflict.

				beginning with the fifth fiscal year beginning after its
