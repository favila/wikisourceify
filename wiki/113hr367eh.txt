{{Center|AN ACT}}

 To amendchapter 8of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2013   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them. Moreover, as a tax on carbon emissions increases energy costs on consumers, reduces economic growth and is therefore detrimental to individuals, families and businesses, the REINS Act includes in the definition of a major rule, any rule that implements or provides for the imposition or collection of a tax on carbon emissions. 

=Sec. 3. Congressional review of agency rulemaking=

  Chapter 8of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:

<blockquote> 
:8 Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking–  Sec. 801. Congressional review. 802. Congressional approval procedure for major rules. 803. Congressional disapproval procedure for nonmajor rules. 804. Definitions. 805. Judicial review. 806. Exemption for monetary policy. 807. Effective date of certain rules.
