{{Center|A BILL}}

To require that every mammography summary delivered to a patient after a mammography examination, as required by section 354 of the Public Health Service Act (commonly referred to as the “Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992” ), contain information regarding the patient’s breast density and language communicating that individuals with more dense breasts may benefit from supplemental screening tests, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Breast Density and Mammography Reporting Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) The American Cancer Society reports that an individual with dense breast tissue faces a relative risk of developing breast cancer 4 or more times higher than an individual without dense breast tissue.
:(2) The National Cancer Institute estimates that 1 in 8 women in the United States will develop a cancer of the breast in their lifetime.
:(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that breast cancer is the number one cause of cancer death among Hispanic women, and the number two cause of cancer death among White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.
:(4) Individuals receiving mammograms are not currently required to receive medical summaries or reports from their mammogram providers which address breast density or its correlation to breast cancer, despite the fact that the radiologist interpreting the mammogram makes an assessment of the patient’s breast density.

=Sec. 3. Breast density reporting by facilities that perform mammograms to physicians and patients=
