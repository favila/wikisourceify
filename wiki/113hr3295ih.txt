{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to eliminate contributing factors to disparities in breast cancer treatment through the development of a uniform set of consensus-based breast cancer treatment performance measures for a 6-year quality reporting system and value-based purchasing system under the Medicare program.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Eliminating Disparities in Breast Cancer Treatment Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Delays in receiving care after breast cancer diagnosis are reported to be greater for African-American women than White women.
:(2) Recent studies indicate that African-American women with breast cancer are less likely to receive standard therapy than White women.
:(3) African-American and Hispanic patients are significantly more likely than White patients to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of breast cancer.
:(4) Investigators found that regardless of insurance status, African-American women are 1.9 times more likely to be diagnosed with an advanced stage of breast cancer than White women and Hispanic women are 1.4 times more likely to be diagnosed with an advanced stage of breast cancer than White women.
:(5) African-American women are ten percent more likely not to receive tests to determine if breast cancer has spread to axillary (underarm) lymph nodes. Studies show that health insurance status, race, income, and educational background are directly linked to irregularity in administering this vital screening.
:(6) According to American Cancer Society researchers, substantial disparities remain or persist regarding cancer diagnosis and treatment.

=Sec. 3. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to promote the implementation of standardized health care practices for breast cancer treatment under the Medicare program to eliminate disparities in the provision of care to such patients based on race, level of education, income, and health insurance status of such patients.

=Sec. 4. Consensus-based breast cancer treatment performance measures system under Medicare=

 Title XVIII of the Social Security Actis amended by adding at the end the following new section:
