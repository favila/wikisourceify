				total research and development costs to be paid in advance to an applicant, in
				accordance with the procedures developed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]] for the making of the
				payments, if, after consideration of the reviewer reports described in
				subparagraph (D)
 and such other information as the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]] determines
				appropriate, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]] determines—
(I)
the concept, in
				good faith, will likely result in a viable and marketable policy consistent
				with section 508(h)
;

(II)
in the sole
				opinion of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]], the concept, if developed into a policy and approved by
				the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]], would provide crop insurance coverage—
(aa)
in
				a significantly improved form;

(bb)
to
				a crop or region not traditionally served by the Federal crop insurance
				program; or

(cc)
in
				a form that addresses a recognized flaw or problem in the program;


(III)
the applicant
				agrees to provide such reports as the Corporation determines are necessary to
				monitor the development effort;

(IV)
the proposed
				budget and timetable are reasonable; and

(V)
the concept
				proposal meets any other requirements that the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]] determines
				appropriate.


(ii)
Waiver
The [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]] may waive the cap specified in
				clause (i)
 on the advance payment of costs and pay more of the projected total
				research and development costs in advance if, in the sole discretion of the
				[[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Board]] determines that the concept proposal provides coverage for a
				region or crop that is underserved by the Federal crop insurance program,
				including specialty
				crops.
