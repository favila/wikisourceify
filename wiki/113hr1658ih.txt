{{Center|A BILL}}

To help fulfill the Federal mandate to provide higher educational opportunities for Native American Indians.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Native American Indian Education Act” .

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that Federal funding is provided to support and sustain the longstanding Federal mandate requiring colleges and States to waive, in certain circumstances, tuition charges for Native American Indian students they admit to an undergraduate college program, including the waiver of tuition charges for Indian students who are not residents of the State in which the college is located.

=Sec. 3. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Native American-serving nontribal college institutions have a valuable supplemental role to that provided by tribally controlled community colleges in making available educational opportunities to Native American Indian students.
:(2) Some four-year Native American-serving nontribal college institutions provide tuition-free education, with the support of the State in which they are located, as mandated by Federal statute, to hundreds of Native American Indian students in fulfillment of a condition under which the United States provided land and facilities for such colleges to a State or college.
:(3) The value of the Native student tuition waiver benefits contributed by these colleges and the States which support them today far exceeds the value of the original grant of land and facilities.
:(4) The ongoing financial burden of meeting this Federal mandate to provide tuition-free education to Indian students is no longer equitably shared among the States and colleges because it does not distinguish between Indian students who are residents of the State or of another State.
:(5) Native student tuition waiver benefits are now at risk of being terminated by severe budget constraints being experienced by these colleges and the States which support them.

=Sec. 4. State relief from Federal mandate=

===(2) Eligible colleges– ===

For purposes of this section, an eligible college is any four-year Native American-serving nontribal institution of higher education which provides tuition-free education as mandated by Federal statute, with the support of the State in which it is located, to Native American Indian students in fulfillment of a condition under which the college or State received its original grant of land and facilities from the United States.

===(3) Limitation– ===

==(b) Treatment of payment– ==

Any amounts received by a college under this section shall be treated as a reimbursement from the State in which the college is located, and shall be considered as provided in fulfillment of any Federal mandate upon the State to admit Indian students free of charge of tuition.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to relieve any State from any mandate it may have under Federal law to reimburse a college for each academic year—
