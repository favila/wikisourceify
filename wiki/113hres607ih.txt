 Recognizing the importance of the historic 2014 Indian Elections.    Whereas India is the world’s largest democracy, with more than 1.2 billion people living in 29 states and 7 union territories;   Whereas the United States established diplomatic relations with India on November 1, 1946, and officially recognized India as an independent state on August 15, 1947;   Whereas the United States-India relationship is rooted in common values, including democracy, respect for ethnic and religious diversity, and the rule of law and is further strengthened by strong people-to-people ties;   Whereas the United States supports the fundamental democratic rights guaranteed in the Constitution of India;   Whereas the United States recognizes the critical role India plays in maintaining regional and global stability;   Whereas Indian foreign direct investment in the United States economy has surpassed $5 billion, creating and supporting thousands of United States jobs;   Whereas United States agricultural, manufacturing, defense and energy industries are eager to engage with India for mutual growth opportunities;   Whereas with some 550 million people voting, India’s recent elections marked the largest democratic exercise in the world;   Whereas all parties participating in India’s polls carried out a hard-fought, free and fair election;   Whereas the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prevailed in the election, securing 282 out of 543 total seats of the Lok Sabha (India’s lower house of Parliament);   Whereas the new Indian government’s commitment to efficient governance, respect for the rule of law, and strong alliances with strategic partners like the United States will benefit India and the United States-India partnership;   Whereas the United States has an opportunity to build on the U.S.-India strategic partnership that has been cultivated over the course of the past decades with both the Congress Party and BJP-led governments; and   Whereas the President of the United States,
[[w:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]], has invited Prime Minister Modi to visit the United States and committed to work with the new government to “fulfill the extraordinary promise of the United States-India strategic partnership”: Now, therefore, be it
