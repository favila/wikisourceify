:(2) Banks and other financial institutions that provide trade facilitation credit also profit from export subsidies such as loan guarantees and trade insurance.
:(3) International trade finance is well developed and supplied by the private sector at competitive rates that reflect market conditions.
:(4) The [[w:Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank of the United States]] is an agency of the United States Government that subsidizes exports by insuring or guaranteeing trade facilitation loans and other credit from private financial institutions and by providing direct loans to exporters in the United States.
:(5) Export subsidies impose risks on the taxpayers of the United States.
:(6) In a June 2012 report, the [[w:Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office]] found, using accurate, fair value estimation, that the expected return of the [[w:Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank of the United States]] was less than1/10of the estimate under the current, flawed methodology used pursuant to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/661 2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.] ).
:(7) Recent years have revealed other safe Federal credit programs to have large taxpayer costs, including [[w:Freddie Mac|Freddie Mac]] , [[w:Fannie Mae|Fannie Mae]] , and the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Federal Housing Administration]] .
