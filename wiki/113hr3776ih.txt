In the case of a compensation arrangement between a physician (or an immediate family member of such physician) and a person or entity that is in violation of subsection (a)(1) solely due to technical noncompliance, instead of the sanctions described in paragraphs (1) , (2) , and (3) for any such violation, the person or entity with respect to such arrangement shall be subject to a single civil monetary penalty under this paragraph in an amount that does not exceed—
:(i) in the case where the disclosure of the violation is submitted to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] not later than the date that is one year after the initial date of noncompliance, $5,000; and
:(ii) in the case where the disclosure of the violation is submitted to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] after the date that is one year after the initial date of noncompliance, $10,000.

====(B) Acceptance of voluntary disclosures– ====



=====(i) In general– =====

Effective on the date of the enactment of this paragraph, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall accept the voluntary disclosure of a technically noncompliant compensation arrangement if such voluntary disclosure is made as described in clause (iii) . The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may accept and reasonably rely on information provided by a person or entity that is in violation of subsection (a)(1) only because of a compensation arrangement that is technically noncompliant.

=====(ii) Acceptance of disclosure– =====

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may reject any voluntary disclosure submitted under clause (iii) within 90 days after the receipt of the disclosure only if the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines that the disclosure does not conform to the requirements described in clause (iii) . If the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] fails to reject a voluntary disclosure within such 90-day period, the voluntary disclosure is deemed to be accepted.

=====(iii) Voluntary disclosure– =====

A voluntary disclosure described in this clause, with respect to a compensation arrangement, is a disclosure submitted to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] , by a party to such arrangement that contains the following:
:(I) The identification of the disclosing party and all other parties to the disclosed compensation arrangement.
:(II) A description of the compensation paid under the arrangement and the dates of noncompliance.
:(III) A certification by the disclosing party that the compensation arrangement—
::(aa) is technically noncompliant (as defined by subparagraph (C) );
::(bb) has been cured of the technical noncompliance, or is otherwise terminated; and
::(cc) is, in the case of technical noncompliance under subparagraph (C)(i) , a valid contract under State law, an arrangement consistent with fair market value, and one in which remuneration under the arrangement is not determined in a manner that takes into account directly or indirectly the volume or value of any referrals.
:(IV) Payment for the full amount of the civil monetary penalty under clause (i) or (ii) , as applicable, of subparagraph (A) .

====(C) Definition technical noncompliance– ====

:(i) the arrangement is not set forth in writing;
:(ii) the arrangement is not signed by 1 or more parties to the arrangement; or
:(iii) a prior arrangement expired and services continued without the execution of an amendment to such arrangement or a new arrangement.

====(D) Applicability to pre-enactment disclosures to relieve backlog– ====

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall provide for the application of this paragraph to any technically noncompliant compensation arrangement that has been disclosed, and to which there has not been a final settlement as of the date of enactment of this paragraph.

====(E) Report– ====

Not later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the [[w:Office of the Inspector General|Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services]] shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] a report on the implementation of this paragraph. Such report shall include—
:(i) the number of persons or entities making disclosures of technical noncompliance under this paragraph;
:(ii) the amount and type of alternative sanctions collected or imposed for technical noncompliance;
:(iii) the types of violations disclosed; and
