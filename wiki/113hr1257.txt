[[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) According to the
			 [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], there are 79,000,000 adults with
			 pre-diabetes in America. The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers]] estimates that 50 percent of adults who
			 are 65 years of age or older have pre-diabetes. More than 90 percent of adults
			 with pre-diabetes are unaware they have it.
:(2) For a significant
			 number of people with pre-diabetes, early intervention can reverse elevated
			 blood glucose levels to normal range and prevent diabetes and its complications
			 completely or can significantly delay its onset. According to the Institute for
			 Alternative Futures, if 50 percent of adults with pre-diabetes were able to
			 successfully make lifestyle changes proven to prevent or delay diabetes, then
			 by 2025 approximately 4,700,000 new cases of diabetes could be prevented at a
			 cost savings of $300 billion.
:(3) Nearly 1-in-5
			 hospitalizations in 2008 were related to diabetes according to the [[w:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Agency for
			 Healthcare Research and Quality]].
:(4) Preventing
			 diabetes and its complications can save money and lives. The average annual
			 cost to treat someone with diabetes is $11,744, compared to $2,935 for someone
			 who does not have diabetes. One out of every three Medicare dollars is spent on
			 diabetes.
:(5) Diabetes is unique
			 because its complications and their associated health care costs are often
			 preventable with currently available medical treatment and lifestyle
			 changes.
:(6) In 2002, the
			 Diabetes Prevention Program study conducted by the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of
			 Health]] found that participants (all of whom were at increased risk of
			 developing type 2 diabetes) who made lifestyle changes reduced their risk of
			 developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent and that participants who are 60 years
			 of age or older reduced their risk of developing diabetes by 71 percent.
:(7) The [[w:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Agency for
			 Healthcare Research and Quality]] has demonstrated that $2,500,000,000 in
			 hospitalization costs related to the treatment of diabetes or complications
			 resulting from diabetes could be saved by providing seniors with appropriate
			 primary care to prevent the onset of diabetes.
:(8) The Medicare
			 program currently provides coverage for screening and identifying beneficiaries
			 with pre-diabetes but does not provide adequate services to such beneficiaries
			 to help them prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.
