{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week of October 27 through November 2, 2014, as“National Drug Take-Back Week”, and designating October 2014 as“National Prescription Opioid and Heroin Abuse Awareness Month”.    Whereas prescription opioids can play an integral role in proper pain management and treatment of health conditions;   Whereas when no longer needed or wanted for legitimate pain management or health treatment, prescription opioids are susceptible to diversion;   Whereas prescription opioids may be abused by individuals who were not prescribed such drugs or misused by individuals not taking such drugs as directed;   Whereas prescription opioid pain relievers are powerful, regulated drugs that, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, attach to the same cell receptors as heroin;   Whereas prescription opioids, when used improperly or not taken as prescribed, can be addictive;   Whereas scientific studies indicate a link between prescription opioid abuse and potential future heroin use and addiction;   Whereas compared to prescription opioids, heroin is a cheaper drug and becoming more readily available;   Whereas deaths from heroin overdoses have significantly increased in communities across the United States;   Whereas addiction and overdoses take lives, ruin families, and fuel rising crime rates in communities across the United States;   Whereas drug take-back programs allow for the collection and safe disposal of unwanted or unused drugs; and   Whereas drug take-back days are held infrequently: Now, therefore, be it
