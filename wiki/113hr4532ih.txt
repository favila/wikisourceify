:(ii) a period of 36 months has passed since the bank holding company was last reviewed under subparagraph (A) .

=======(D) Notification of review– =======

If, after a review under this paragraph, the Council determines that a bank holding company described under subparagraph (A) shall be subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards, the Council shall provide the bank holding company with written notice of such determination and an explanation of the Council’s reasoning for such determination.
