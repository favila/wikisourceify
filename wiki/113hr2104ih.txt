{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title 18, United States Code, and the Social Security Act to limit the misuse of Social Security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for such misuse, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title; table of contents=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the “Protecting the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act of 2013” .

==(b) Table of contents– ==

The table of contents of this Act is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.Sec. 2. Findings.Sec. 3. Prohibition of the display, sale, or purchase of Social Security numbers.Sec. 4. Application of prohibition of the display, sale, or purchase of Social Security numbers to public records.Sec. 5. Rulemaking authority of the Attorney General.Sec. 6. Limits on personal disclosure of a Social Security number for consumer transactions.Sec. 7. Extension of civil monetary penalties for misuse of a Social Security number.Sec. 8. Criminal penalties for the misuse of a Social Security number.Sec. 9. Civil actions and civil penalties.Sec. 10. Federal injunctive authority.

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of Social Security numbers has contributed to a growing range of illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.
:(2) While financial institutions, health care providers, and other entities have often used Social Security numbers to confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of individual privacy.
:(3) The Federal Government requires virtually every individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a Social Security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for Social Security benefits, or to seek employment. An unintended consequence of these requirements is that Social Security numbers have become one of the tools that can be used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of Social Security numbers.
:(4) The display, sale, or purchase of Social Security numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, or purchase would not affect public debate.
:(5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or purchase of Social Security numbers in circumstances that create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are assigned.
:(6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that has been assigned a Social Security number some degree of protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful conduct.
