          Removal from the
			 United States of certain criminal aliens is necessary, and the unauthorized

			 States.

          The 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
            
			 should deter such reentry by specifying mandatory sentencing ranges for these
			 crimes.

				aids or assists any alien violating section 276(b) to reenter the United
				States, or who connives or conspires with any person or persons to allow,
