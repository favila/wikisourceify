{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the Department of State a Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBT Peoples.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   International Human Rights Defense Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Appropriate congressional committees– ==

The term appropriate congressional committees means—
:(A) the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Committee on Foreign Relations]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations of the Senate]]; and
:(B) the [[w:United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]]and the [[w:United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives]].

==(2) Gender identity– ==

The term gender identity means the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual’s designated sex at birth.

==(3) LGBT– ==

The term LGBT means lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.

==(4) Sexual orientation– ==

The term sexual orientation means homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality. 

=Sec. 3. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) Eighty-two countries prohibit the public support of the LGBT community, promote homophobia across society, or criminalize homosexuality. That is equal to more than 40 percent of United Nations Member States.
:(2) In seven countries, homosexuality is a crime that is punishable by death.
:(3) Around the world, LGBT people face discrimination, hatred, violence, and bigotry.
:(4) Violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity are documented in the Department of State’s annual Human Rights Report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]. The 2013 report continues to show a clear pattern of increased human rights violations in every region of the world based on sexual orientation and gender identity. These violations include murder, rape, torture, death threats, extortion, imprisonment, as well as loss of employment, housing, access to health care, and other forms of societal stigma and discrimination. The report further documents growing LGBT-specific restrictions on basic freedoms of assembly, press, and speech in every region of the world.
:(5) In Jamaica and other countries, discrimination against LGBT people, including“corrective rape”of lesbian women, occurs all too frequently and with relative impunity.
:(6) In 2013, the Government of the Russian Federation and others in the region passed laws banning“Homosexual Propaganda”, which effectively makes it a crime to publically support LGBT equality.
:(7) In February 2014, the Government of Uganda adopted a law that makes“aggravated homosexuality”a crime punishable with life imprisonment and endangers any individual arbitrarily found to support LGBT people. Concurrently, the Government of Uganda also passed laws severely limiting the basic freedoms of speech and assembly for LGBT citizens.
:(8) In December 2013, the Government of Nigeria adopted a law further criminalizing homosexuality. The law also criminalizes supporting LGBT people in any way, endangering the neighbors, friends, doctors, and landlords of LGBT people.
:(9) The anti-homosexuality laws in Nigeria and Uganda potentially endanger all LGBT individuals in those countries. In addition, international HIV workers could be at risk since the study and treatment of at-risk populations may constitute support for LGBT people.
:(10) On December 6, 2011, President
[[w:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]]released the Presidential Memorandum—International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Persons. The memorandum directed all Federal agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United States diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and protect the human rights of LGBT persons.
:(11) Secretary of State John Kerry has announced that the United States Government will review United States diplomatic relationships with Nigeria and Uganda in light of passage of their recent anti-LGBT laws. On March 23, 2014, the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]announced that the United States Government would cut $6,400,000 in funding for the Interreligious Council of Uganda because of its support for the Anti-Homosexuality Act, halt a survey designed to minimize the spread of HIV/AIDS because of potential harm to respondents, impose short-term travel bans on Ugandan military officials, and halt some joint military exercises with the military of Uganda.
:(12) In December 2013, the Supreme Court of India reversed a lower court ruling and reinstated the criminalization of homosexuality in the second most populous nation on Earth. In April 2014, India’s Supreme Court recognized transgender people as a third gender, improving the legal rights of transgender people in that country. Given these two court decisions, the degree of human rights protections for LGBT persons in India is uncertain.
:(13) Removing institutionalized discrimination and targeted persecution against LGBT people around the world is a critical step in the promotion of human rights and global health internationally.
:(14) According to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project, which monitors homicides of transgender individuals, 238 transgender persons were killed between November 2012 and November 2013 worldwide.
:(15) According to the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, as published by the [[w:United Nations|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], countries should review and reform criminal laws and correctional systems to ensure that they are consistent with international human rights obligations and are not misused in the context of HIV or targeted against vulnerable groups. 

=Sec. 4. Statement of policy=

It is the policy of the United States—
:(1) to take effective action to prevent and respond to discrimination and violence against all people on any basis internationally, including sexual orientation and gender identity, and that human rights policy include attention to hate crimes and other discrimination against LGBT people;
:(2) to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts to prevent and respond to discrimination and violence against LGBT people internationally into United States foreign policy;

:(7) to enhance training by United States personnel of professional foreign military and police forces and judicial officials to include appropriate and thorough LGBT-specific instruction on preventing and responding to discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity;
:(8) to engage non-LGBT people as allies and partners, as an essential element of making sustained reductions in discrimination and violence against LGBT people;
:(9) to require that all Federal contractors and grant recipients in the United States Government's international programs establish appropriate policies and take effective measures to ensure the protection and safety of their staff and workplace, including from discrimination and violence directed against LGBT people and those who provide services to them;
:(10) to exert sustained international leadership to prevent and respond to discrimination and violence against LGBT persons, including in bilateral and multilateral fora;
:(11) to fully implement and expand upon the policies outlined in the Presidential Memorandum—International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Persons;
:(12) to ensure that international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS take all appropriate measures to support at-risk communities, including LGBT persons, and to create enabling legal environments for these communities;
:(13) to work with governments and nongovernmental partners around the world to develop and implement regional strategies to decriminalize homosexuality and to counteract the prohibition of public support of the LGBT community; and
:(14) to ensure that those who have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of being LGBT or supporting LGBT rights have the opportunity to seek protection in the United States.
