{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of National Community Gardening Awareness Month.    Whereas countless American families live with hunger every day;   Whereas countless American families do not have access to fresh produce in their neighborhoods;   Whereas community gardens conserve limited resources and promote sustainability;   Whereas community gardens provide an important and nutritious source of fresh produce donations for local food pantries and social service agencies;   Whereas community gardens enable individuals to gain control over the quality, variety, and cost of their food supply;   Whereas community gardening encourages Americans of diverse cultural and economic backgrounds to work together, foster a better sense of community, and improve the quality of their lives;   Whereas community-based youth and school gardening programs encourage personal self-esteem and a healthy attitude toward learning;   Whereas community gardening and greening projects provide a catalyst for neighborhood and community development;   Whereas community gardens reduce city heat and preserve open spaces for both present and future generations;   Whereas community gardens and other green spaces provide a more livable environment in American municipalities and present a positive local image to a community's residents and visitors; and   Whereas August is an appropriate month to designate as National Community Gardening Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
