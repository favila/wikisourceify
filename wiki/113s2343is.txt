{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to require mandatory reporting of incidents of child abuse or neglect, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Speak Up to Protect Every Abused Kid Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) children are dependent on the adults in their lives, including parents, extended family, teachers, health care providers, and others in their community, to ensure their safety and well-being;
:(2) data from the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Administration on Children and Families]]for 2012 indicate that 678,810 children in the United States were reported as being victims of child abuse or neglect, and 11,539 of those children died as a result of such abuse or neglect;
:(3) regardless of whether an adult is legally required to report child abuse and neglect, every adult who suspects or knows about child abuse or neglect has a moral duty to report such concerns to the appropriate authorities; and
:(4) establishing a Federal standard for the classes of individuals that State law establishes as mandated reporters will protect children and ensure greater consistency among the laws of States, while allowing States the flexibility to establish additional classes of individuals as mandated reporters.
