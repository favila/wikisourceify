The requirement of subsection (a)(7)(B)(i)may be waived by the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] , in the case of an alien who is a national of a country described in subparagraph (B)and who is applying for admission as a nonimmigrant visitor for business or pleasure and solely for entry into and stay in the United States Virgin Islands for a period not to exceed 30 days, if the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] , after consultation with the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] , the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] , the Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, determines that such a waiver does not represent a threat to the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its territories and commonwealths.

=====(B) Countries– =====

A country described in this subparagraph is a country that—
:(i) is a member or an associate member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM); and
:(ii) is listed in the regulations described in subparagraph (D).

=====(C) Alien waiver of rights– =====

An alien may not be provided a waiver under this paragraph unless the alien has waived any right—
:(i) to review or appeal under this Act an immigration officer's determination as to the admissibility of the alien at the port of entry into the United States Virgin Islands; or
:(ii) to contest, other than on the basis of an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of this Actor under the Convention Against Torture, or an application for asylum if permitted under section 208, any action for removal of the alien.

=====(D) Regulations– =====

All necessary regulations to implement this paragraph shall be promulgated by the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] , in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] and the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] , on or before the 60th day after the date of enactment of the Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2013. The promulgation of such regulations shall be considered a foreign affairs function for purposes of [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 section 553(a)of title 5, United States Code] . At a minimum, such regulations should include, but not necessarily be limited to—
:(i) a listing of all member or associate member countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) whose nationals may obtain the waiver provided by this paragraph, except that such regulations shall not provide for a listing of any country if the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] determines that such country's inclusion on such list would represent a threat to the welfare, safety, or security of the United States or its territories and commonwealths; and
:(ii) any bonding requirements for nationals of some or all of those countries who may present an increased risk of overstays or other potential problems, if different from such requirements otherwise provided by law for nonimmigrant visitors.

=====(F) Suspension– =====

The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] shall monitor the admission of nonimmigrant visitors to the United States Virgin Islands under this paragraph. If the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] determines that such admissions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors from a country remaining unlawfully in the United States Virgin Islands, unlawfully obtaining entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking withholding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from a country pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of the United States Virgin Islands or of the United States (including the interest in the enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States), the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] shall suspend the admission of nationals of such country under this paragraph. The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] may in the Secretary's discretion suspend the United States Virgin Islands visa waiver program at any time, on a country-by-country basis, for other good cause.

=====(G) Addition of countries– =====
