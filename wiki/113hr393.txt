			 title– ==

This Act may be cited
			 as the “Domestic Violence Judicial
			 Support Act of 2013”.

=={{anchor|HCF74EEF2BB4C4A50986C2503EF5EC31A}}(b) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) The 2010 National Survey by the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for
			 Disease Control and Prevention]] found that 1 in 4 women have been the victim of
			 severe physical violence by an intimate partner, while 1 in 7 men experienced
			 severe physical violence by an intimate partner. Female victims of intimate
			 partner violence experienced different patterns of violence than male victims.
			 Female victims experienced multiple forms of these types of violence; male
			 victims most often experienced physical violence.
:(2) A critical issue in domestic violence cases
			 is the risk of continued victimization during the pretrial period. Offenders
			 may violate no-contact orders, further injure victims, or intimidate them. Such
			 occurrences highlight a critical need for efficiency in court proceedings.
:(3) Of 3,750 intimate partner violence cases filed in State courts in 16 large
			 urban counties in 2002, children were present during the violent incident in 36
			 percent of the cases. Of those children who were present, 60 percent directly
			 witnessed the violence. Court collection of information and statistics related
			 to children who witnessed a violent incident between intimate partners assists
			 courts in identifying children in need of services as a result of such an
			 incident.
:(4) Domestic violence
			 cases involving spouses and other intimate partners often entail complex
			 processes that require careful consideration by the criminal justice system. In
			 the 1990s, many jurisdictions began to create specialized domestic violence
			 courts for judges to ensure follow-through on cases, aid domestic violence
			 victims, and hold offenders accountable, with the assistance of justice and
			 social service agencies. By specializing in domestic violence offenses, these
			 courts aim to process cases more efficiently and deliver more consistent
			 rulings about domestic violence statutes. Some domestic violence courts also
			 incorporate a stronger focus on rehabilitation of offenders and deterrence of
			 repeat offenses. These courts can also be more sensitive to the needs of
			 victims and be able to direct victims to additional community resources.
:(5) One-third of
			 violent felony defendants in State criminal courts have been charged with
			 domestic violence.
:(6) Teen dating violence cases are best handled
			 by courts who have had the training to make informed decisions and have the
			 resources to make services available, on-site and in the community,
			 including—
::(A) counseling;
::(B) victim witness
			 services;
::(C) assistance with
			 civil restraining orders, paternity determinations, custody and access orders,
			 and child support orders; and
::(D) locating other
			 assistance needed by teen victims.
:(7) There are more than 400,000 children in
			 foster care in the United States. Congress has charged juvenile courts with
			 oversight of child welfare cases. Highly trained and engaged judges focused on
			 effective case oversight and system reform have been shown to save significant
			 foster care costs for the States.
:(8) A 2009 study by the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]
			 found that Kentucky saved $85,000,000 in one year through the issuance of
			 protection orders and the reduction in violence resulting from the issuance of
			 such orders. Examples such as this are prevalent across the Nation.
:(9) Children with a Court Appointed Special
			 Advocate volunteer experience fewer out of home placements, are less likely to
			 age out of foster care without a permanent home, and have significantly
			 improved education performance, compared to their peers without a volunteer
			 advocate.
:(10) By reducing long-term foster care
			 placements, subsequent victimization, and reentry into the foster care system,
			 the Court Appointed Special Advocate program substantially reduces child
			 welfare costs.
