:(1) identifying the support needs of caregivers;
:(2) developing and disseminating modes for intervention;
:(3) providing information that caregivers need, particularly in crisis situations; and

:(2) $3,000,000,000 on HIV/AIDS research; and
:(3) $2,000,000,000 on cardiovascular disease research;Whereas while the cost to the Medicare and Medicaid programs of caring for Alzheimer’s patients is $142,000,000,000 each year, the United States spends slightly more than $500,000,000 each year on Alzheimer's research;Whereas the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services created by the National Alzheimer’s Project Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/11225 42 U.S.C. 11225] )has testified before [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that the United States must devote at least $2,000,000,000 each year to Alzheimer’s research to reach the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer’s by 2025; andWhereas the public members of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services unanimously agree with the testimony of the Chairman regarding the amount of money required to reach the goal for 2025: Now, therefore, be it
