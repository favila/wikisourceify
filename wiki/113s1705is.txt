{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide a Federal charter for the National Fab Lab Network, a national network of local digital fabrication facilities providing community access to advanced manufacturing tools for learning skills, developing inventions, creating businesses, and producing personalized products.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ National Fab Lab Network Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Scientific discoveries and technical innovations are critical to the economic and national security of the United States.
:(2) Maintaining the leadership of the United States in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will require a diverse population with the skills, interest, and access to tools required to advance these fields.
:(3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in communications and computation provided individuals with the Internet and personal computers, a digital revolution in fabrication will allow anyone to make almost anything, anywhere.
:(4) Fab labs like the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provide a model for a new kind of national laboratory that links local facilities for advanced manufacturing to expand access and empower communities.
:(5) A coordinated national public-private partnership will be the most effective way to accelerate the provision of this infrastructure for learning skills, developing inventions, creating businesses, and producing personalized products.
