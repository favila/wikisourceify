Any budget plan for a fiscal year for the Government submitted by the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] to the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] shall include a justification by each department or agency of the Government for any funding proposed for that department or agency in that plan.

={{anchor|H15286889AD2F4DFDBDD7F75DEE95B820}}9. =
