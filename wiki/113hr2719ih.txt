{{Center|A BILL}}

To require the Transportation Security Administration to implement best practices and improve transparency with regard to technology acquisition programs, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:Transportation Security Administration|Transportation Security Administration]] (in this Act referred to as TSA ) does not consistently implement Department of Homeland Security policies and Government best practices for acquisition and procurement.
:(2)  [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] has not developed a multiyear technology acquisition plan. As a result, [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] has underutilized innovation opportunities within the private sector, including from small businesses.
:(3) Due in part to the deficiencies referred to in paragraphs (1)and (2), [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] has faced challenges in meeting key performance requirements for several major acquisitions and procurements, resulting in reduced security effectiveness and wasted expenditures.
