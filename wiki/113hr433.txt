          Findings
          
            
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             finds that—

            (A)
            the land designated as wilderness by this Act is located—

              (i)
              in the semiarid region of the Great Basin; and
            

              (ii)
              at the headwaters of the streams and rivers on land with respect to which there are few, if any—

                (I)
                actual or proposed water resource facilities located upstream; and
              

                (II)
                opportunities for diversion, storage, or other uses of water occurring outside the land that would adversely affect the wilderness values of the land;
              
            
          

            (B)
            the land designated as wilderness by this Act is generally not suitable for use or development of new water resource facilities; and
          

            (C)
            because of the unique nature of the land designated as wilderness by this Act, it is possible to provide for proper management and protection of the wilderness and other values of land in ways different from those used in other laws.
          
        

          (2)
          Purpose
          The purpose of this section is to protect the wilderness values of the land designated as wilderness by this Act by means other than a federally reserved water right.
        

          (3)
          Statutory construction
          Nothing in this Act—

            (A)
            constitutes an express or implied reservation by the United States of any water or water rights with respect to a wilderness designated by this Act;
          

            (B)
            affects any water rights in the State (including any water rights held by the United States) in existence on the date of enactment of this Act;
          

            (C)
            establishes a precedent with regard to any future wilderness designations;
          

            (D)
            affects the interpretation of, or any designation made under, any other Act; or
          

            (E)
            limits, alters, modifies, or amends any interstate compact or equitable apportionment decree that apportions water among and between the State and other States.
          
        

          (4)
          Nevada water law
          The 
                [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]]
             shall follow the procedural and substantive requirements of State law in order to obtain and hold any water rights not in existence on the date of enactment of this Act with respect to the wilderness area designated by this Act.

              (ii)
              Exclusion
              In this paragraph, the term water resource facility does not include wildlife guzzlers.
            
          

            (B)
            Restriction on new water resource facilities
            Except as otherwise provided in this Act, on or after the date of enactment of this Act, neither the 
                [[Executive Office of the President|President]]
             nor any other officer, employee, or agent of the United States shall fund, assist, authorize, or issue a license or permit for the development of any new water resource facility within a wilderness area, any portion of which is located in the County.

             does not intend for the designation of land as wilderness by this Act to create a protective perimeter or buffer zone around the wilderness area.
      

        (b)
        Nonwilderness Activities
        The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or heard from areas within the wilderness designated by this Act shall not preclude the conduct of the activities or uses outside the boundary of the wilderness area.

             finds that, for the purposes of 
            section 603 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782), the 
                [[Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]]
             land in any portion of the Blue Lakes and Alder Creek wilderness study areas not designated as wilderness by section 4(a) has been adequately studied for wilderness designation.
      

        (b)
        Release
        Any public land described in subsection (a) that is not designated as wilderness by this Act—

          (1)
          is no longer subject to 
              section 603(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782(c));

      Wildlife management

        (a)
        In general
        In accordance with 
            section 4(d)(7) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(7)), nothing in this Act affects or diminishes the jurisdiction of the State with respect to fish and wildlife management, including the regulation of hunting, fishing, and trapping, in the wilderness area designated by this Act.
      

        (b)
        Management activities
        In furtherance of the purposes and principles of the 
            Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), management activities to maintain or restore fish and wildlife populations and the habitats to support the populations may be carried out within the wilderness area designated by this Act, if the activities are carried out—

          (1)
          consistent with relevant wilderness management plans; and
        

          (2)
          in accordance with—

            (A)
            the 
                Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.); and
          

            (B)
            appropriate policies, such as those set forth in Appendix B of House Report 101–405, including the occasional and temporary use of motorized vehicles if the use, as determined by the 
                [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]]
            , would promote healthy, viable, and more naturally distributed wildlife populations that would enhance wilderness values with the minimal impact necessary to reasonably accomplish those tasks.
