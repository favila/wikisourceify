{{section|HBD6BF2A3908D4B3F9624D56240C57E8F|1. Short title}}
This Act may be cited as the
			 
          Pool Safety and Accessibility for
			 Everyone Act

        
 or the 
          Pool SAFE Act

        
.

{{section|H7EDDA906DFF2410D9BEBB2BB46C255AD|2. Findings}}
Congress finds the following:
(1)
One of the
			 purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
 is to provide a
			 clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination
			 against individuals with disabilities
.

(2)
The Nation’s
			 proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to ensure equality of
			 opportunity and full participation for such individuals.

(3)
The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of
			 Justice’s]] revised regulations for titles II
 and III of the Americans with
			 Disabilities Act of 1990
 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act)
			 recognize that public accommodations should provide access to their amenities
			 to individuals with disabilities.

(4)
It is important
			 for public accommodations to provide access to their amenities, including
			 pools, to individuals with disabilities.

(5)
Public
			 accommodations should provide access to their amenities, including pools, in a
			 reasonable, efficient, and expedient manner that accounts for the interests of
			 individuals with disabilities and also considers other legitimate concerns,
			 such as safety and feasibility.

(6)
The revised
			 regulations for titles II
 and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of
			 1990
, as the regulations relate to the accessibility of pools at public
			 accommodations, do not reasonably or adequately balance the access needs of
			 individuals with disabilities with other legitimate, and sometimes competing,
			 safety and feasibility concerns.
