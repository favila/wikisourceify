2. Findings


Congress finds the following:
: One of the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is to “provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities ”.: The Nation’s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to ensure equality of opportunity and full participation for such individuals.: The [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice’s ]]revised regulations for titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) recognize that public accommodations should provide access to their amenities to individuals with disabilities.: It is important for public accommodations to provide access to their amenities, including pools, to individuals with disabilities.: Public accommodations should provide access to their amenities, including pools, in a reasonable, efficient, and expedient manner that accounts for the interests of individuals with disabilities and also considers other legitimate concerns, such as safety and feasibility.: The revised regulations for titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 , as the regulations relate to the accessibility of pools at public accommodations, do not reasonably or adequately balance the access needs of individuals with disabilities with other legitimate, and sometimes competing, safety and feasibility concerns.
