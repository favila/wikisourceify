=Sec. 3. Statement of policy=

It is the policy of the United States to support a broad range of implementation and research and development activities that work toward the achievement of cost-effective and sustainable treatment, control and, where possible, elimination of neglected tropical diseases for the economic and social well-being for all people. 

=Sec. 4. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]]( [[w:World Health Organization|WHO]]) has identified 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Approximately two billion people—almost one-third of the world’s population—are at risk of contracting an NTD, and more than 1.4 billion people are currently afflicted with one or more NTDs.
:(2) In 2013, [[w:World Health Organization|WHO]]adopted a comprehensive resolution on NTDs recognizing that increased national and international investments in prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases have succeeded in improving health and social well-being in many countries.
:(3) NTDs have an enormous impact in terms of disease burden and quality of life. NTDs cause the loss of up to 534,000 lives and 57 million disability-adjusted life years each year. NTDs surpass both malaria and tuberculosis in causing greater loss of life-years to disability and premature death. Many NTDs cause disfigurement and disability, leading to stigma, social discrimination, and societal marginalization.
:(4) NTDs create an economic burden of billions of dollars through the loss of productivity and high costs of health care required for treatment. People afflicted by NTDs are less productive than their healthy counterparts. NTDs jeopardize the ability of people to attend work and school, or to produce at full capacity. For example, controlling one NTD, hookworm, in children can result in a 43-percent increase in future wage earnings.
:(5) The social, economic, and health burden of NTDs falls primarily on low- and middle-income countries, where access to safe water, sanitation, and health care is limited. At least 100 countries face two endemic NTD burdens, and 30 countries carry six or more endemic NTDs.
:(6) NTDs are not confined to the developing world, however. Several NTD outbreaks have been reported in the United States and other developed countries, especially among the poor. In the United States, NTDs disproportionately affect people living in poverty, and especially minorities, including up to 2.8 million African-Americans with toxocariasis and 300,000 or more people, mostly Hispanic-Americans, with Chagas disease.
:(7) Many NTDs can be controlled, prevented, and even eliminated using low-cost, effective, and feasible solutions. Understanding the economic burden of NTDs on productivity and health care costs can help to assure governments and donors that the resources directed toward NTDs represent a good investment.
:(8) Research and development efforts are immediately needed for all NTDs, especially those for which limited or no treatment currently exists.
:(9) Critical to developing robust NTD control strategies are epidemiological data that identify at-risk populations, ensure appropriate treatment frequency, and inform decisions about when treatment can be reduced or stopped.
:(10) Of the 14 most common NTDs, roughly 80 percent of infections are caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis. STH are a group of three parasitic worms (roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms) that afflict more than one billion people worldwide, including 600 million school-age children, of whom more than 300 million suffer from severe morbidity. Schistosomiasis is another helminth infection affecting at least 200 million people in developing countries, but some estimates indicate that the true number of people affected may be double or even triple that number.
:(11) The main health problems caused by STH are related to their negative effect on childhood nutritional status, which can cause stunting and wasting. For example, STH infection may lead to anemia, malabsorption of nutrients, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and reduced food intake. When such health problems are experienced in early childhood, a peak growth and development period, the mental and physical damage—and loss of future productivity and wage-earning potential—will likely be irreversible. Schistosomiasis causes end-organ damage to the urinary tract, female genital tract, liver and intestines. It also results in chronic health conditions in children.
:(12) STH and schistosomiasis are also particularly detrimental to the health of women of reproductive age and pregnant women. Their underlying poor iron status makes these women most susceptible to developing anemia. Iron deficiency anemia resulting from hookworm infection during pregnancy has been linked to poor pregnancy outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight, and impaired lactation. Female genital schistosmiasis may be one of the most common gynecologic conditions in Africa leading to genital pain, itching, and bleeding and markedly increased susceptibility to HIV/AIDS.
:(13) Fortunately, there is a simple, cost-effective solution to STH and schistosomiasis infections: single-dose deworming pills that can be safely administered once or twice annually to those at risk. Pharmaceutical companies have committed to donate the drugs needed to treat all at-risk, school-age children in developing countries. Regular administration of deworming pills reduces morbidity associated with STH and schistosomiasis infections by reducing prevalence and transmission rates.
:(14) The benefits of deworming are immediate and enduring. A rigorous randomized controlled trial has shown school-based deworming treatment to reduce school absenteeism by 25 percent. School-based deworming also benefits young siblings and other children who live nearby but are too young to be treated, leading to large cognitive improvements equivalent to half a year of schooling.

==Title I— Foreign affairs==



==Sec. 101. Expansion of USAID NTDs Program==



===(a) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Since fiscal year 2006, the United States Government has been an essential leading partner in advancing control and elimination efforts for seven targeted neglected tropical diseases: lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness), schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH) (round worm, whip worm, and hook worm), and trachoma. Additional information suggests that such efforts could also produce collateral benefits for at least three other NTDs: foodborne trematodiases, rabies, and yaws (endemic treponematoses).
:(2) The [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development (USAID)]]Neglected Tropical Diseases Program has made important and substantial contributions to the global fight to control and eliminate the seven most common NTDs. Leveraging more than $6.7 billion in donated medicines, [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]has supported the distribution of more than one billion treatments in 25 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.
:(3) United States Government leadership has been instrumental in maintaining the global fight against NTDs and is a partner in the 2012 London Declaration on NTDs, which represents a new, coordinated push to accelerate progress toward eliminating or controlling 10 neglected tropical diseases by 2020.
:(4) The USAID NTDs Program is a clear example of a successful public-private partnership between the Government and the private sector and should be judiciously expanded.

===(b) Sense of Congress– ===

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that the USAID NTDs Program (as in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act) should be modified as follows:
:(1) Provide rapid impact package treatments to as many individuals suffering from NTDs or at risk of acquiring NTDs as logistically feasible.
:(2) Better integrate rapid impact package treatments with programs to control and eliminate HIV/AIDS and malaria, including—
::(A) by coordinating HIV/AIDS programs with the control of female genital schistosomiasis, now revealed as one of Africa’s most important co-factors in its AIDS epidemic; and
::(B) by coordinating malaria programs with programs to control schistosomiasis and hook worm—together these diseases produce profound and severe anemia.
:(3) Establish school-based NTD programs to provide an opportunity to reach large numbers of school-age children who require treatments for NTDs, including rapid impact package treatments as feasible and at very low cost.
:(4) For other NTDs, such as human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and dengue fever, develop new approaches to reach the goals relating to the elimination of NTDs as set forth in the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]]( [[w:World Health Organization|WHO]]) NTD Roadmap.

===(c) Expansion of program– ===

The [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Administrator of USAID]]shall expand the USAID NTDs Program (as in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act) as follows:
:(1) Carry out monitoring and evaluation to provide accurate measurements to inform future NTD control and elimination strategies.
:(2) Coordinate with [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]development sectors, such as sectors relating to water and sanitation, hygiene, food security and nutrition, and education (both primary and preprimary), to establish programs that address NTDs and advance the goals of the 2012 London Declaration on NTDs.
:(3) Include morbidity management in treatment plans for high-burden NTDs, such as lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis).
:(4) Include NTDs that are recognized as high-burden diseases in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, including foodborne trematodiases, human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and dengue fever and related arbovirus infections.
:(5) Include research and development, consistent with other [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]disease prevention programs, to ensure the tools required for elimination of these diseases are available, such as drugs, diagnostics, vaccines.

===(d) Research and development– ===
