Whereas the week of May 5 through 11, 2013 has been designated as“Public Service Recognition Week”to honor the employees of the Federal Government and State and local governments of the United States;   Whereas Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity to recognize and promote the important contributions of public servants and honor the diverse men and women who meet the needs of the United States through work at all levels of government;   Whereas millions of individuals work in government service in every city, county, and State across the United States and in hundreds of cities abroad;   Whereas public service is a noble calling involving a variety of challenging and rewarding professions;   Whereas the Federal Government and State and local governments are responsive, innovative, and effective because of the outstanding work of public servants;   Whereas the United States is a great and prosperous country, and public service employees contribute significantly to that greatness and prosperity;   Whereas the United States benefits daily from the knowledge and skills of the highly-trained individuals who work in public service;   Whereas public servants—
