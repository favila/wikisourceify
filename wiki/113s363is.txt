To expand geothermal production, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Noncompetitive leasing of adjoining areas for development of geothermal resources=

 Section 4(b) of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/30/1003 30 U.S.C. 1003(b)] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

::(bb) $50.

====(ii) Industry standards– ====

The term industry standards means the standards by which a qualified geothermal professional assesses whether downhole or flowing temperature measurements with indications of permeability are sufficient to produce energy from geothermal resources, as determined through flow or injection testing or measurement of lost circulation while drilling.

====(iii) Qualified Federal land– ====

The term qualified Federal land means land that is otherwise available for leasing under this Act.

====(iv) Qualified geothermal professional– ====

The term qualified geothermal professional means an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist in good professional standing with at least 5 years of experience in geothermal exploration, development, or project assessment.
