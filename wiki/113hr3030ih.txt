{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat Indian tribal governments in the same manner as State governments for certain Federal tax purposes, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) There is a unique Federal legal and political relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.
:(2) Indian tribes have the responsibility and authority to provide governmental programs and services to tribal citizens, develop tribal economies, and build community infrastructure to ensure that Indian reservation lands serve as livable, permanent homes.
:(3) The United States Constitution, U.S. Federal Court decisions, Executive orders, and numerous other Federal laws and regulations recognize that Indian tribes are governments, retaining the inherent authority to tax and operate as other governments, including (inter alia) financing projects with government bonds and maintaining eligibility for general tax exemptions via their government status.
:(4) Codifying tax parity with respect to tribal governments is consistent with Federal treaties recognizing the sovereignty of tribal governments.
:(5) That Indian tribes face historic disadvantages in accessing the underlying capital to build the necessary infrastructure for job creation, and that certain statutory restrictions on tribal governance further inhibit tribes’ ability to develop strong governance and economies.
:(6) Indian tribes are sometimes excluded from the Internal Revenue Code of 1986in key provisions which results in unfair tax treatment for tribal citizens or unequal enforcement authority for tribal enforcement agencies.
:(7) Congress is vested with the authority to regulate commerce with Indian tribes, and hereby exercises that authority in a manner which furthers tribal self-governance, and in doing so, further affirms the United States government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes.
