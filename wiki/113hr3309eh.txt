The court shall award, to a prevailing party, reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with a civil action in which any party asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, unless the court finds that the position and conduct of the nonprevailing party or parties were reasonably justified in law and fact or that special circumstances (such as severe economic hardship to a named inventor) make an award unjust.

====(b) Certification and recovery– ====

Upon motion of any party to the action, the court shall require another party to the action to certify whether or not the other party will be able to pay an award of fees and other expenses if such an award is made under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/285 subsection (a)].

====(c) Covenant not to sue– ====

A party to a civil action that asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents against another party, and that subsequently unilaterally extends to such other party a covenant not to sue for infringement with respect to the patent or patents at issue, shall be deemed to be a nonprevailing party (and the other party the prevailing party) for purposes of this section, unless the party asserting such claim would have been entitled, at the time that such covenant was extended, to voluntarily dismiss the action or claim without a court order under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. .

=====(A) Discretionary denial of motion– =====

The court may deny a motion to join an interested party under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299 paragraph (1)]if—
:(i) the interested party is not subject to service of process; or

=====(B) Required denial of motion– =====

The court shall deny a motion to join an interested party under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299 paragraph (1)]if—
:(i) the interested party did not timely receive the notice required by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299 paragraph (3)]; or

::(i) an attorney or law firm providing legal representation in the civil action described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299 paragraph (1)]if the sole basis for the financial interest of the attorney or law firm in the patent or patents at issue arises from the attorney or law firm’s receipt of compensation reasonably related to the provision of the legal representation; or

Except as provided in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsections (b)]and[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A (c)], in a civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, if the court determines that a ruling relating to the construction of terms used in a patent claim asserted in the complaint is required, discovery shall be limited, until such ruling is issued, to information necessary for the court to determine the meaning of the terms used in the patent claim, including any interpretation of those terms used to support the claim of infringement.

====(b) Discretion To expand scope of discovery– ====



=====(1) Timely resolution of actions– =====

In the case of an action under any provision of Federal law (including an action that includes a claim for relief arising under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271 section 271(e)]), for which resolution within a specified period of time of a civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents will necessarily affect the rights of a party with respect to the patent, the court shall permit discovery, in addition to the discovery authorized under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)], before the ruling described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)]is issued as necessary to ensure timely resolution of the action.

=====(2) Resolution of motions– =====

When necessary to resolve a motion properly raised by a party before a ruling relating to the construction of terms described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)]is issued, the court may allow limited discovery in addition to the discovery authorized under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)]as necessary to resolve the motion.

=====(3) Special circumstances– =====

In special circumstances that would make denial of discovery a manifest injustice, the court may permit discovery, in addition to the discovery authorized under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)], as necessary to prevent the manifest injustice.

=====(4) Actions seeking relief based on competitive harm– =====

The limitation on discovery provided under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)]shall not apply to an action seeking a preliminary injunction to redress harm arising from the use, sale, or offer for sale of any allegedly infringing instrumentality that competes with a product sold or offered for sale, or a process used in manufacture, by a party alleging infringement.

====(c) Exclusion from discovery limitation– ====

The parties may voluntarily consent to be excluded, in whole or in part, from the limitation on discovery provided under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)]if at least one plaintiff and one defendant enter into a signed stipulation, to be filed with and signed by the court. With regard to any discovery excluded from the requirements of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/299A subsection (a)]under the signed stipulation, with respect to such parties, such discovery shall proceed according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. .

<blockquote>  299A. Discovery in patent infringement action.  . 
</blockquote>


==(e) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that it is an abuse of the patent system and against public policy for a party to send out purposely evasive demand letters to end users alleging patent infringement. Demand letters sent should, at the least, include basic information about the patent in question, what is being infringed, and how it is being infringed. Any actions or litigation that stem from these types of purposely evasive demand letters to end users should be considered a fraudulent or deceptive practice and an exceptional circumstance when considering whether the litigation is abusive.

==(f) Demand letters– ==

</blockquote>

:(4) in the last undesignated paragraph, by striking“The court”and inserting“(d)Expert testimony.—The court”.

==(g) Effective date– ==

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to any action for which a complaint is filed on or after that date.
