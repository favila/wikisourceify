:(6) the Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust conserves and enhances community-based conservation and stewardship inside and outside of the Greenway landscape, illustrated by the fact that—
::(A) the Greenway Trust is led by a 60-person board that includes local and State officials, agency staff, and business and nonprofit representatives;
::(B) thousands of volunteers have donated hundreds of thousands of hours to the Greenway supporting stewardship projects on public lands; and
::(C) over the span of 20 years, partners have collaborated to conserve more than 225,000 acres of land in the Greenway for natural systems, recreation, timber, and agriculture.
