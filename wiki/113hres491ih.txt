Res. 175)in July 2011 affirming the United States support for the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the country of Georgia, and calling upon Russia to remove its occupying forces from Abkhazia and South Ossetia;   Whereas the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]of the112th United States Congress adopted a resolution (H. Res. 526)in September 2012 affirming support for the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Georgia and the inviolability of its borders, and recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia as regions of Georgia illegally occupied by the Russian Federation;   Whereas the August 2008 military conflict between Russia and Georgia resulted in civilian and military causalities, the violation of Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and increased the number of internally displaced persons;   Whereas the August 12, 2008, ceasefire agreement negotiated by the European Union Presidency and agreed to by the Presidents of Georgia and the Russian Federation, provides that all Russian troops shall be withdrawn to preconflict positions;   Whereas Georgia in 2010 made a unilateral pledge not to use force against Russia or Georgia’s Russian-occupied territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and reiterated that pledge in a unanimous parliamentary resolution in 2013;   Whereas since 1993, the territorial integrity of Georgia has been reaffirmed by the international community in 36 United Nations Security Council resolutions;   Whereas Russia continues to erect physical barriers along the Administrative Boundary Lines of the occupied Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where Russian troops continue to be stationed despite a commitment in the 2008 ceasefire agreement to withdraw to preconflict positions;   Whereas Russia has not reciprocated to Georgia’s unilateral pledges for non-use of force;   Whereas the United States supports Georgia’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders of Georgia;   Whereas at the April 15, 2011, meeting in Berlin, Germany, between the Georgian foreign minister and foreign ministers of [[w:NATO|NATO]], Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stated,“U.S. support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity remains steadfast … We share Georgian concerns regarding recent Russian activities that can negatively affect regional stability”;   Whereas the North Atlantic Council Foreign Ministers, meeting on December 7, 2011, applauded the significant operational support provided to [[w:NATO|NATO]]by aspirant partners Georgia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina;   Whereas Vice President Joseph Biden stated in Munich on February 2, 2014, that“there is unfinished business in our common project of a Europe whole and free. Georgia and the states of the Balkans have unfulfilled aspirations for Euro-Atlantic integration. The pace of these integration efforts will be determined by the aspirants themselves. But we too share a responsibility for helping them achieve their rightful place in Europe and the Transatlantic Alliance.”;   Whereas the Government of Georgia, beginning with the Rose Revolution of 2003, has taken significant steps toward promoting democratic, judicial, and economic reforms and has indicated its intent to continue to make progress in these areas;   Whereas Georgia has initiated positive developments and commitments in the areas of constitutional reforms, strengthening the role of Parliament, and utilizing international election organizations and transparency;   Whereas the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, other international observers, and the United States indicated that Georgia’s October 2013 Presidential election met international standards;   Whereas international observers have hailed Georgia’s October 2012 parliamentary elections as competitive and complimented the country’s leaders for conducting a democratic vote;   Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry said in May 2013,“We remain committed to Georgia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders, and to the continued strengthening of Georgia’s democratic institutions … and we continue to support Georgia’s integration into the Euro-Atlantic community”;   Whereas recognizing that members of [[w:NATO|NATO]]share a common adherence to democratic norms, Georgia can best prepare itself for membership by progressing on its democratic reform agenda;   Whereas, H. Res. 526 of September 2012 also expresses support for Georgia’s [[w:NATO|NATO]]membership aspirations and to advance further implementation of decisions taken by the allies at the [[w:NATO|NATO]]Summits in Bucharest, Strasbourg and Kehl, and Lisbon with regard to Georgia’s [[w:NATO|NATO]]membership;   Whereas, during the [[w:NATO|NATO Military Committee]](MC) visit to Georgia on February 11, 2014, and February 12, 2014, General Knud Bartels, Chairman of the NATO MC emphasized Georgia’s significant progress in achieving its ambitious defense reforms; expressed the Committee’s“strong support”for the reforms and its confidence that the“transformation is comprehensive, solid and irreversible”, also noting that“The NATO Military Committee strongly supports these reforms and looks forward to strengthening military cooperation, both in terms of operational engagements and interoperability in order to maintain the beneficial partnership we have built throughout the years.”;   Whereas Georgia has been a reliable partner and ally in enhancing global peace and stability with its contribution to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan;   Whereas in Iraq, thousands of Georgian forces helped guard the Iraqi side of the Iraq-Iran border, having redeployed from the safety of the Green Zone to accept this dangerous mission;   Whereas in Afghanistan, Georgia has contributed troops to the [[w:NATO|NATO-International Security Assistance Force]](ISAF) mission since 2004, and engaged in combat operations in Helmand province side-by-side with the United States Marines;   Whereas Georgia has been the largest non- [[w:NATO|NATO]]troop contributor and the fifth largest troop contributor overall, serving without any national caveats;   Whereas, despite the heavy casualties, Georgia is committed to remain in the [[w:NATO|NATO ISAF]]until the end of the mission and stands ready to continue its significant contribution to the [[w:NATO|NATO]]’s post-ISAF missions in Afghanistan;   Whereas Georgia remains committed to provide full transit capacity in support of the United States and coalition troops in Afghanistan;   Whereas [[w:NATO|NATO]]agreed to include Georgia in the [[w:NATO|NATO]]Response Force in 2015;   Whereas Georgia expressed its intent to participate in EU and [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]-led crisis management and stabilization missions;   Whereas the United States rejects the long-outdated notion of the spheres of influence and strongly stands by the principle that sovereign democracies are free in their decision and choice of their own partnerships and alliances;   Whereas Georgia has sought to strengthen its economic and political ties with [[w:NATO|NATO]]countries; and   Whereas the United States has long supported the European aspirations of Georgia: Now, therefore, be it
