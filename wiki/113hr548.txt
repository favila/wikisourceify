1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Border Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2013”.

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:
: The United States and Mexico share a border of nearly 2,000 miles, a cultural heritage, and a desire to grow both economies through cooperation and hard work.: Border commerce is vital to the United States economy. Mexico is the United States third-largest trading partner, behind only Canada and China. In 2010, trade between the United States and Mexico reached $367,000,000,000, amounting to more than $1,000,000,000 per day.: Mexico is the second-largest export market for United States businesses and approximately 22 States depend on Mexico as their number one or two trading partner.: The growth of international trade has outpaced United States land ports of entry’s workload capacity, resulting in congestion and delays. This increased congestion hurts businesses that rely on safe and efficient cross-border traffic.
