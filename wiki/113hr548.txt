This Act may be cited as the
			 “Border Infrastructure and Jobs Act of
			 2013”.

={{anchor|HAC3332E2D5DC4D479CC9D9D68259808A}}Sec. 2. Findings=

[[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The United States
			 and Mexico share a border of nearly 2,000 miles, a cultural heritage, and a
			 desire to grow both economies through cooperation and hard work.
:(2) Border commerce is
			 vital to the United States economy. Mexico is the United States third-largest
			 trading partner, behind only Canada and China. In 2010, trade between the
			 United States and Mexico reached $367,000,000,000, amounting to more than
			 $1,000,000,000 per day.
:(3) Mexico is the
			 second-largest export market for United States businesses and approximately 22
			 States depend on Mexico as their number one or two trading partner.
:(4) The growth of
			 international trade has outpaced United States land ports of entry’s workload
			 capacity, resulting in congestion and delays. This increased congestion hurts
			 businesses that rely on safe and efficient cross-border traffic.
