{{Center|A BILL}}

To abolish the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Export-Import Bank Termination Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Export subsidies provide advantages to specific industries or businesses at the expense of their domestic competition, other sectors of the United States economy, and the public at large.
:(2) Banks and other financial institutions that provide trade facilitation credit also profit from export subsidies such as loan guarantees and trade insurance.
:(3) International trade finance is well developed and supplied by the private sector at competitive rates that reflect market conditions.
:(4) The [[w:Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank of the United States]] is an agency of the United States Government that subsidizes exports by insuring or guaranteeing trade facilitation loans and other credit from private financial institutions and by providing direct loans to United States exporters.
:(5) Export subsidies impose risks on United States taxpayers. In a June 2012 paper using accurate, fair value estimation, the [[w:|Congressional Budget Office]] found that the expected return of the [[w:Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank of the United States]] was less than a tenth of the estimate under the current, flawed methodology used pursuant to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.
:(6) Recent years have revealed other “safe” Federal credit programs to have large taxpayer costs, for example, [[w:Freddie Mac|Freddie Mac]] , [[w:Fannie Mae|Fannie Mae]] , and the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Federal Housing Administration]] .
:(7) The [[w:Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank of the United States]] claims to serve small businesses primarily, but most of its financing subsidizes exports of large multinational corporations.
