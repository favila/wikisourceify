There is established within the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] a WaterSense program to identify and promote water efficient products, buildings and landscapes, and services in order—
:(1) to reduce water use;
:(2) to reduce the strain on water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure;
:(3) to conserve energy used to pump, heat, transport, and treat water; and
:(4) to preserve water resources for future generations,through voluntary labeling of, or other forms of communications about, products, buildings and landscapes, and services that meet the highest water efficiency and performance standards.

=={{anchor|H3B57DC1164EF4C47B155E5D022B3E493}}(b) Duties– ==

The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]] shall—

::(B) ensuring product and service performance;
:(2) work to enhance public awareness of the WaterSense label through public outreach, education, water recycling and reuse technology research and development, and other means;
:(3) establish and maintain performance standards so that products, buildings and landscapes, and services labeled with the WaterSense label perform as well or better than their less efficient counterparts;
:(4) publicize the importance of proper installation of WaterSense plumbing products by a WaterSense-certified or, if WaterSense certification guidelines do not exist, licensed plumber or mechanical contractor, and the installation, maintenance, and audit of WaterSense irrigation systems by a WaterSense-certified irrigation professional to ensure optimal performance;

::(A) an explanation of changes; and
::(B) as appropriate, responses to comments submitted by interested parties;
:(11) provide appropriate lead time (as determined by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] ) prior to the applicable effective date for a new or significant revision to a category, specification, installation criterion, or other criterion, taking into account the timing requirements of the manufacturing, marketing, training, and distribution process for the specific product, building and landscape, or service category addressed; and
:(12) identify and, where appropriate, implement other voluntary approaches, such as labeling waterless devices that perform the same function as a water consuming product or encouraging reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies, in commercial, institutional, residential, municipal, and industrial sectors to improve water efficiency or lower water use while meeting the performance standards established under paragraph (3).
