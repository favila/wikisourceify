:(1) a national leadership council and forum named the American Lighthouse Council (formerly the American Lighthouse Coordinating Committee), currently headquartered in Illinois;
:(2) the American Lighthouse Foundation in Maine;
:(3) the Michigan Lighthouse Alliance and Michigan Lighthouse Conservancy;
:(4) the Maine Lights Program;
:(5) the Outer Banks Lighthouse Society in North Carolina;
:(6) the New Jersey Lighthouse Society;
:(7) the Florida Lighthouse Association; and
:(8) the Lighthouse Preservation Society in Massachusetts;Whereas major lighthouse publications, including the United States Lighthouse Society’s Keeper’s Log and the Lighthouse Digest, contribute greatly to the promotion of lighthouse heritage and preservation;Whereas single-lighthouse preservation efforts by individuals or organizations, including historical societies and governments, have even longer histories, including preservation efforts in—
:(1) Grosse Point, Illinois, established in 1935;
:(2) Buffalo, New York, established in 1962;
:(3) Navesink Twin Lights, New Jersey, established in 1962;
:(4) Point Fermin, California, established in 1970;

:(8) Ponce de Leon Inlet, Florida, established in 1972;
:(9) St. Augustine, Florida, established in 1981; and
:(10) Fire Island, New York, established in 1982;Whereas, despite progress, many lighthouses in the United States remain threatened by erosion, neglect, vandalism, and deterioration by the elements;Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed, aJoint Resolution entitled “ Joint Resolution designating the day of August 7, 1989, as “National Lighthouse Day” ” , approved November 5, 1988 ([[Public Law 100-622|Public Law 100–622]] ;102 Stat. 3201), in honor of the bicentennial of the United States Lighthouse Service; andWhereas the many completed, ongoing, or planned private and public efforts to preserve lighthouses demonstrate the public support for those historic structures: Now, therefore, be it
