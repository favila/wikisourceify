{{Center|A BILL}}

To direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate and address cancer and disease clusters, including in infants and children.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Strengthening Protections for Children and Communities From Disease Clusters Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) children are particularly at risk from environmental pollutants or toxic substances for various reasons, including because—
::(A) the nervous, immune, digestive, and other systems of children are still developing as the children move though several stages of rapid growth and development;
::(B) exposure to environmental pollutants or toxic substances can affect prenatal, infant, and childhood growth and development;
::(C) children may be less able to detoxify and excrete toxins than adults;
::(D) children eat proportionately more food, drink more fluids, breathe more air, and play outside more, which means children are more exposed to environmental pollutants and toxic substances than adults;
::(E) children are less able to protect themselves from exposures to environmental pollutants or toxic substances;
::(F) the behavior of children exposes children to different environmental pollutants and toxic substances than adults;
::(G) the natural curiosity and tendency of children to explore leaves children open to health risks that adults can more easily avoid; and
::(H) the developing brains, reproductive systems, and other organs of children are more susceptible to permanent disruption that can result in health problems during the lives of the children;
:(2) according to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] , birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the first year of life, accounting for about 20 percent of infant deaths in 2006;
:(3) according to the American Cancer Society, cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, exceeded only by accidents;
:(4) according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] , an estimated 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder;
:(5) scientific research on environmental, genetic, and other influences that may affect environmental health is a national priority;
:(6) Federal agencies should work to address serious environmental health problems to better protect children and other individuals in communities, both large and small, across the United States; and
:(7) according to the National Academy of Sciences—
::(A) it is in the national interest to place a higher priority on the health of children;
::(B) in the short term, that priority will result in children whose health and quality of life is improved and who are more ready and able to learn;
::(C) children have important value in their own right and are worthy of that type of societal commitment;
::(D) it is also in the national interest to optimize the health of children because, in the long term—
:::(i) the continuing viability of society depends on a citizenry and a workforce that are properly equipped to be productive and committed to serving the country; and
:::(ii) failure to improve the health of children will have a substantial long-term consequence for the health of the adult population; and
::(E) investing in the health of children is necessary for all of the reasons described in subparagraphs (A) through (D)and is the right thing to do.

=Sec. 3. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to provide to the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] the authority to help conduct investigations into the potential for environmental pollutants or toxic substances to cause disease clusters;
