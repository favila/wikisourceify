 To provide for the establishment of a National Rare-Earth Refinery Cooperative, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   National Rare-Earth Cooperative Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings; statement of policy=



==(a) Findings– ==

Congress makes the following finding:
:(1) Heavy rare-earth elements are critical for the national defense of the United States, advanced energy technologies, and other desirable commercial and industrial applications.
:(2) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]]has confirmed that the monopoly control of the People’s Republic of China over the rare-earth value chain has resulted in vulnerabilities in the procurement process of multiple United States weapons systems.
:(3) China has leveraged its monopoly control over the rare-earth value chain to force American, European, Japanese, and Korean corporations to transfer manufacturing facilities, technology, and jobs to China in exchange for secure supply contracts.
:(4) China’s increasingly aggressive mercantilist behavior has resulted in involuntary transfers of technology, manufacturing facilities, and jobs as well as onerous trade imbalances with the United States and trading partners of the United States.
:(5) Direct links exist between heavy rare-earth mineralogy and thorium.
:(6) Thorium is a mildly radioactive element commonly associated with the lanthanide elements in the most heavy rare-earth deposits that are located in the United States and elsewhere.
:(7) Regulations regarding thorium represent a barrier to the development of the heavy rare-earth industry that is based in the United States.
:(8) Balancing the strategic national interest objectives of the United States against economic and environmental risks is best met through the creation of a rare-earth cooperative.
:(9) A rare-earth cooperative could—
::(A) greatly increase rare-earth production;
::(B) ensure environmental safety; and
::(C) lower the cost of production and financial risks faced by rare-earth producers in the United States.
:(10) Historically, agricultural and electric cooperatives have stood as some of the greatest success stories of the United States.

==(b) Statement of policy– ==

It is the policy of the United States to advance domestic refining of heavy rare-earth materials and the safe storage of thorium in anticipation of the potential future industrial uses of thorium, including energy, as—
:(1) thorium has a mineralogical association with valuable heavy rare-earth elements;
:(2) there is a great need to develop domestic refining capacity to process domestic heavy rare-earth deposits; and
:(3) the economy of the United States would benefit from the rapid development and control of intellectual property relating to the commercial development of thorium-utilizing technology.
