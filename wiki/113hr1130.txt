{{Center|A BILL}}

To authorize further assistance to Israel for the Iron
		  Dome anti-missile defense system.

={{anchor|H519CE7C7F11942D8BF6BA7A7BF59F3DD}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the
			 “Iron Dome Support
			 Act”.

={{anchor|HA07910CD3AFF47B1A2E7632CB952FA2E}}Sec. 2. Findings=

[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The State of Israel remains under grave
			 threat and frequent attack from missiles, rockets, and mortar shells fired at
			 Israeli civilian targets by militants from the Foreign Terrorist Organization
			 Hamas on its southern border and by the Foreign Terrorist Organization
			 Hezbollah on its northern border, which have killed, wounded, or inflicted
			 psychological trauma on countless Israelis.
:(2) The United States
			 remains committed to Israel’s qualitative military edge, including its
			 advantage over non-state actors such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which boast
			 increasingly sophisticated and powerful weapons as a result of support from
			 Iran, Syria, and other state actors.
:(3) The Israeli
			 Defense Forces report that the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system has
			 achieved a success rate of more than 85 percent, intercepting rockets bound for
			 residential neighborhoods, busy road junctions, shopping centers, and crowded
			 streets in southern Israel.
:(4) The recent success
			 of the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system during Operation Pillar of Defense
			 averted massive Israeli casualties, thereby eliminating Israel’s need to
			 conduct a ground-based attack against Gaza-based terrorists, enhancing Israel’s
			 operational flexibility, and preventing terrorists from plunging the region
			 into crisis whenever they choose.
:(5) The United States
			 can help to advance its own vital national security interests and the cause of
			 Middle Eastern peace and stability by supporting Israel’s ability to defend
			 itself against missiles, rockets, and other threats.
:(6) Israel has
			 indicated that it is ready to share the technology of the Iron Dome
			 anti-missile defense system with the United States for the United States use to
			 strengthen the United States defense capabilities.
:(7) The Government of
			 Israel currently has five operational Iron Dome batteries deployed in the
			 field, which are far from sufficient to protect all of Israel’s
			 territory.

			 assistance to Israel for Iron Dome anti-missile defense system=

The [[Wikipedia:Executive Office of the President|President]], acting through the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Secretary
			 of Defense]] and the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]], is authorized to provide assistance,
			 upon request by the Government of Israel, for the procurement, maintenance,
			 enhancement, and sustainment of the Iron Dome defense system for purposes of
			 intercepting short-range and medium-range rockets, missiles, and projectiles
			 launched against Israel.
