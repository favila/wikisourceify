{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide for the elimination of the Department of Education, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Department of Education Elimination Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) Principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the States and the people and a Federal [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]is inconsistent with such principles.
:(2) Tradition and experience dictate that the governance and management of schools in the United States are best performed by parents, teachers, and communities.
:(3) The education of the Nation’s students is suffering under a managerial government.
:(4) The [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]has weakened the ability of parents to make essential decisions about their children’s education and has undermined the capacity of communities to govern their schools.
:(5) In the 34 years of its existence, the [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]has grown from a budget of $14 billion to almost $65.7 billion in annual discretionary appropriations administering around 100 programs. Meanwhile, education performance for 17-year olds has stagnated since 1971.
:(6) The [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]has fostered over-regulation, standardization, bureaucratization, and litigation in United States education.
:(7) The [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]expends large amounts of money on its own maintenance and overhead. While the average salary for public school teachers is around $56,000, the average salary for a [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]employee is $108,571.
:(8) Recent tests reflect poor results in mathematics, science, and reading for American students compared with students from other nations.
:(9) Only through initiatives led by parents and local communities with the power to act can the United States elevate educational performance toward an acceptable level.
:(10) The current system of top down education uniformity is detrimental to local businesses and communities, the economic needs of the states, and the Nation’s ability to compete globally for jobs.
:(11) The [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]has been hostile to many promising reform ideas or empowering parents, teachers, and local communities. The United States, once a laboratory of innovation through the experiments of the States, is moving toward education standardization that does not consider the individual educational needs of our diverse population of students. 

=Sec. 3. Abolition of Department of Education=

The [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]is abolished, and, with the exception of the programs transferred under section 7 , any program for which the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary of Education]]or the [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]has administrative responsibility as provided by law or by delegation of authority pursuant to law is repealed, including each program under the following:
:(1) The  Department of Education Organization Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/3401 20 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.] ).
:(2) The  General Education Provisions Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1221 20 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.] ).
