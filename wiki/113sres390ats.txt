{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating March 11, 2014, as“World Plumbing Day”.    Whereas the plumbing industry plays an important role in safeguarding the public health of the people of the United States and the world;   Whereas 780,000,000 people around the world do not have access to safe drinking water;   Whereas 2,500,000,000 people around the world live without adequate sanitation facilities;   Whereas the lack of water and sanitation is the largest barrier to childhood survival, public health, education, and economic productivity;   Whereas in the developing world, 24,000 children under the age of 5 die every day from preventable causes, such as diarrhea contracted from unclean water;   Whereas safe and efficient plumbing saves money and reduces future water supply costs and infrastructure costs;   Whereas the installation of modern plumbing systems must be accomplished in a specific, safe manner by trained professionals in order to prevent widespread disease, which can be crippling and deadly to the community;   Whereas the people of the United States rely on plumbing professionals to maintain, repair, and rebuild the aging water infrastructure of the United States;   Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and plumbing professionals across the United States and the world are committed to safeguarding public health; and   Whereas the founding organization of World Plumbing Day, the World Plumbing Council, is actively supported by organizations in the United States such as the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials: Now, therefore, be it
