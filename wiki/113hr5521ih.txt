{{Center|A BILL}}

 To direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council to conduct a study on urban flooding, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Urban Flooding Awareness Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Urban flooding defined=



==(a) In general– ==

In this Act, the term“urban flooding”means the inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas, caused by rain falling on increased amounts of impervious surface and overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, such as storm sewers.

==(b) Inclusions– ==

In this Act, the term“urban flooding”includes—
:(1) situations in which stormwater enters buildings through windows, doors, or other openings;
:(2) water backup through sewer pipes, showers, toilets, sinks, and floor drains;
:(3) seepage through walls and floors;
:(4) the accumulation of water on property or public rights-of-way; and
:(5) the overflow from water bodies, such as rivers and lakes.

==(c) Exclusion– ==

In this Act, the term“urban flooding”does not include flooding in undeveloped or agricultural areas. 

=Sec. 3. Urban flooding study=



==(a) Agreement with National Research Council– ==

The [[w:Federal Emergency Management Agency|Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency]]shall enter into an agreement with the National Research Council under which the National Research Council will conduct a study on urban flooding in accordance with the requirements of this section.

==(b) Contents– ==



===(1) General review and evaluation– ===

In conducting the study, the National Research Council shall review and evaluate the latest available research, laws, regulations, policies, best practices, procedures, and institutional knowledge regarding urban flooding.

===(2) Specific issue areas– ===

The study shall include, at a minimum, an examination of the following:
:(A) The prevalence and costs associated with urban flooding events across the United States, with a focus on the largest metropolitan areas and any clear trends in frequency and severity over the past 2 decades.
:(B) The adequacy of existing federally provided flood risk information and the most cost-effective methods and products to identify, map, or otherwise characterize the risk of property damage from urban flooding on a property-by-property basis, whether or not a property is in or adjacent to a 1-percent (100-year) flood plain, and the potential for training and certifying local experts in flood risk characterization as a service to property purchasers and owners and their communities.
:(C) The causes of urban flooding and its apparent increase over the past 20 years, including the impacts of—
::(i) global climate change;
::(ii) increasing urbanization and the associated increase in impervious surfaces; and
::(iii) undersized, deteriorating and otherwise ineffective stormwater infrastructure.
:(D) The most cost-effective strategies, practices, and technologies used to reduce the impacts of urban flooding, with a focus on decentralized, easy-to-install, and low-cost approaches, such as nonstructural and natural infrastructure on public and private property. The examination under this subparagraph shall include an assessment of opportunities for implementing innovative strategies and practices on government-controlled land, such as Federal, State, and local roads, parking lots, alleys, sidewalks, buildings, recreational areas, and open space.
:(E) The role of the Federal Government and State governments, as conveners, funders, and advocates, in spurring market innovations based on public-private-nonprofit partnerships. Such innovations may include smart home technologies for improved flood warning systems connected to high-resolution weather forecast data and Internet- and cellular-based communications systems.
:(F) The most sustainable and effective methods for funding flood risk and flood damage reduction at all levels of government, including—
::(i) the potential for establishing a State revolving fund program for flood prevention projects similar to the revolving fund programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act ;
::(ii) stormwater fee programs using impervious surface as the basis for fee rates and providing credits for the installation of flood prevention or other stormwater management features;
::(iii) grant programs; and
::(iv) public-private partnerships.
:(G) Information and education strategies and practices, including nontraditional approaches such as the use of social media, for community leaders, government staff, and property owners on—
::(i) flood risks;
::(ii) flood risk reduction strategies and practices; and
::(iii) the availability and effectiveness of different types of flood insurance policies.
:(H) The relevance of the National Flood Insurance Program and Community Rating System to urban flooding areas outside traditional flood plains, and strategies for broadening coverage and increasing participation under the programs.
:(I) Strategies for protecting downstream communities from the flooding impacts of development in upstream communities, including a review of—
::(i) potential standards for watershed-wide flood protection planning; and
::(ii) the potential establishment of streamlined legal processes for victims of flood damage, to avoid the need for expensive litigation.

==(c) Consultation– ==

The [[w:Federal Emergency Management Agency|Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency]]shall carry out this section in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary of the Army]](acting through the [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Chief of Engineers]]), the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]], the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]], and State, regional, and local stormwater management agencies, and such other interested parties as the [[w:Federal Emergency Management Agency|Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency]]considers appropriate.

==(d) Report to Congress– ==

Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Federal Emergency Management Agency|Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency]]shall submit to the [[w:United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]]and the [[w:United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations of the Senate]]a report containing the findings of the National Research Council based on the results of the study, including recommendations for implementation of strategies, practices, and technologies relating to urban flooding by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and the executive branch.
