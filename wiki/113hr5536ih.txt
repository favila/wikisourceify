The Congress finds as follows:
:(1) Approximately 1 in 4 women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime and every year, 1 in 3 women who is a victim of homicide is murdered by her current or former partner.
:(2) Every year, more than 3 million children witness domestic violence in their homes and children who live in homes where there is domestic violence also suffer abuse or neglect at high rates.
:(3) Children are more likely to intervene when they witness severe violence against a parent, which places them at great risk for injury or even death.
:(4) Girls who witness domestic violence are more vulnerable to abuse as teens and adults and boys who witness domestic violence are more likely to become adult abusers of their partners, their children, or both, thus continuing the cycle of violence in the next generation.
:(5) Most domestic violence incidents are never reported.
:(6) Family members, close friends, co-workers, and other persons close to a victim of domestic violence frequently observe things that lead to them to suspect that their loved one or colleague is being abused but do not feel they possess the knowledge and skills needed to provide constructive assistance that can make a real difference in the life of the victim.
:(7) Domestic violence costs the national economy more than $37 billion a year in law enforcement involvement, legal work, medical and mental health treatment, and lost productivity.
