            (c)
            Effective December
				1 of each year, each annuity and allowance under subsection (a) having a

                title II of the
				Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 and following) are increased, effective as
				of such December 1, as a result of a determination under

                (B)
                the applicable reduction amount for

                  $400,000, subject to subparagraph

				account both the amounts properly allocable to the former 
                [[President of the United States|President]]
             and the
				amounts properly allocable to the spouse of the former

                The dollar amount specified in
				subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be adjusted at the same time that, and by the same
				percentage as the percentage by which, the monetary allowance of the former
				
                [[President of the United States|President]]
             is increased under subsection (c) (disregarding this
				subsection).
