{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide a framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in closing procedures for certain types of consumer deposit accounts, to protect individual consumer rights, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act” .

=Sec. 2. Consumer Rights with Respect to Closed Accounts=

The Truth in Savings Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/4301 12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.] )is amended—
:(1) by striking section 262and inserting the following:

<blockquote>

==Sec. 262. Findings and Purposes==



===(a) Findings– ===

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) economic stability would be enhanced, competition between depository institutions would be improved, and the ability of the consumer to make informed decisions regarding deposit accounts, and to verify accounts, would be strengthened if there were uniformity in the disclosure of terms and conditions on which interest is paid and fees are assessed in connection with such accounts; and
:(2) consumers lack meaningful choices for managing household funds because—
::(A) despite dissatisfaction with rising account fees at some depository institutions, consumers often find it too difficult to move their funds to new deposit accounts;
::(B) the process of moving funds to new deposit accounts often involves several steps and substantial time to complete, and it is not always clear what the proper procedures are for closing an account at a given depository institution;
::(C) depository institutions have no obligation and may lack the technical capabilities to help consumers transfer automated deposits or debits from old accounts to new accounts, causing delays and confusion;
::(D) depository institutions may charge fees to close an account and withdraw available funds, which can impede banking mobility for low-income consumers; and
::(E) some depository institutions have engaged in the practice of reopening closed accounts without the consent of the consumer.

===(b) Purposes– ===

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to allow consumers to make a meaningful comparison between competing claims of depository institutions with regard to deposit accounts by requiring the clear and uniform disclosure of—
::(A) the rates of interest that are payable on deposit accounts by depository institutions; and
::(B) the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts; and
:(2) to protect rights of consumers by providing a framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of depository institutions and consumers in closing procedures for certain types of consumer deposit accounts.;
</blockquote>

:(2) by inserting after section 268the following:

<blockquote>

==Sec. 268A. Closure of Covered Accounts==



===(a) In general– ===

A depository institution may not—
:(1) prohibit a consumer from closing a covered account at the depository institution, regardless of whether the balance in the covered account is positive, zero, or negative;
:(2) charge any fee to close a covered account; or
:(3) reopen a covered account that a consumer has requested to be closed in accordance with this section to apply subsequent debits, whether preauthorized or otherwise, or for any other reason, unless the consumer expressly requests that the covered account be reopened.

===(b) Disclosures required– ===

A depository institution shall provide to any consumer that opens a covered account at the depository institution a description of the policies and procedures that the depository institution has in place to close a covered account—
:(1) at the time the consumer opens the covered account;
:(2) at any time, upon request of a consumer; and
:(3) on the website of the depository institution.
