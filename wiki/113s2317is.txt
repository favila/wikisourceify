In this section, the term hazard to public safety or health means an activity, substance, or condition that has a potential to cause harm to the health or safety of the public.

===(b) Disclosure in general– ===



====(1) In general– ====

Except as provided in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 paragraph (2)], a court may not approve or order the enforcement of any provision in a settlement agreement, or other agreement relating to a settlement, between or among parties in a civil suit if—
:(A) a pleading filed in the suit alleges facts that are relevant to protecting the public from a hazard to public safety or health; and
:(B) the provision prohibits a party from—
::(i) disclosing the fact that the settlement was reached;
::(ii) disclosing the terms of the settlement, other than the amount of money, if any, paid under the settlement;
::(iii) discussing the suit or evidence produced in the suit; or
::(iv) otherwise discussing the hazard to public safety or health.

====(2) Balance of interests– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

On a motion by a party to an agreement described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 paragraph (1)], a court may approve or order the enforcement of a provision described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 paragraph (1)(B)], despite the fact that a pleading described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 paragraph (1)(A)]is filed in the suit, if the court, based on an independent finding of fact, determines that—
:(i) the public interest in the disclosure of facts that are relevant to protecting the public from a hazard to public safety or health is outweighed by a specific and substantial interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the information or records that are covered by the provision; and
:(ii) the requested order is no broader than necessary to protect the specific and substantial interest in maintaining confidentiality described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 clause (i)].

=====(B) Considerations– =====

With respect to the balancing of interests described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 subparagraph (A)(i)]—
:(i) there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the interest in protecting financial, medical, or other similar personal information relating to an identifiable individual outweighs the public interest described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 subparagraph (A)(i)];
:(ii) a general interest in the settlement of disputes may not serve as a specific and substantial interest described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 subparagraph (A)(i)]; and
:(iii) a court may redact language in a settlement agreement, in order to accommodate—
::(I) the privacy of personal information; and
::(II) the public benefit of awareness of hazards to public safety and health.

===(c) Disclosure to Federal or State agencies– ===



====(1) In general– ====

A court may not approve or order the enforcement of any provision of a settlement agreement, or other agreement relating to a settlement, between or among parties in a civil suit if—
:(A) a pleading filed in the suit alleges facts that are relevant to protecting the public from a hazard to public safety or health; and
:(B) the provision prohibits or otherwise restricts a party from disclosing a fact described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 subparagraph (A)]to a Federal or State agency with authority to enforce a law or regulate an activity relating to that fact.

====(2) Confidentiality maintained– ====

The confidentiality of a fact described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 paragraph (1)(A)]that is disclosed to a Federal or State agency described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1660 paragraph (1)(B)]shall be protected to the extent otherwise provided under any other law, regulation, or agreement. .
