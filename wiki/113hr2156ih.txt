{{Center|A BILL}}

 To encourage uniformity and reciprocity among States that license insurance claims adjusters and to facilitate prompt and efficient adjusting of insurance claims in the case of natural and other disasters and losses, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act ”or the“ CLAIM Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Model licensing act=

To promote the policy of robust consumer protection for and more efficient interstate adjusting of property, casualty, disability, or workers’ compensation claims, the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]hereby urges the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to adopt a model independent claims adjuster licensing Act that—
:(1) contains basic standards for the integrity, personal qualifications, education, training, and experience required of independent claims adjusters, including continuing education requirements and ethics course requirements; and
:(2) does not impose any limitation or condition upon any independent claims adjuster to be licensed or otherwise authorized to do business in a State because of his or her status as a non-resident of that State. 

=Sec. 3. Multi-State examination=



==(a) Establishment– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]hereby urges the NAIC to adopt and administer a multi-State examination for an independent claims adjuster seeking to adjust claims in a jurisdiction other than his or her home State.

==(b) Examinee eligibility– ==

The NAIC may require that, as a condition for taking a multi-State examination administered pursuant to this section, the examinee shall—
:(1) be duly licensed as an independent claims adjuster by his or her home State;
:(2) meet such integrity, degree, training, and experience requirements as the NAIC considers necessary; and
:(3) meet any continuing education requirements as established by his or her home State.

==(c) Cross-Jurisdiction competency– ==

Any multi-State examination administered pursuant to this section shall require adjusters to demonstrate essential competence with cross-jurisdictional legal and regulatory concepts, and shall include such ethics and other testing as the NAIC deems necessary. 

=Sec. 4. State authorities=

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to—
:(1) require a State that does not have licensing requirements for independent claims adjusters to adopt any such requirements;
:(2) subject to section 6 , limit the right of a State to establish licensing fees or enforce its laws regarding the adjusting of insurance claims, provided that such fee is uniform regardless of the State of residence of the licensee; or
:(3) affect the jurisdiction and authority of a State insurance regulator to prescribe and enforce its insurance laws, rules, and regulations regulating independent claims adjuster activity in its jurisdiction. 

=Sec. 5. Interstate claims adjusting licensing reforms=



==(a) In general– ==

A State is in compliance with the requirements of this subsection, and section 6 shall not apply with respect to such State, if before the expiration of the 4-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act the State has enacted and has in effect—
:(1) in the case only of a State that requires and issues licenses for independent claims adjusters, laws and regulations governing individuals and entities authorized to operate as independent claims adjusters within the State that are functionally equivalent in meaning and effect to those under any model act developed pursuant to section 2 ; and
:(2) laws and regulations governing non-home State individuals and entities operating as independent claims adjusters within that State that provide for the reciprocity required under subsection (c) with other States.

==(b) Uniformity requirements– ==

A State that licenses independent claims adjusters shall be deemed to have established the uniformity referred to in subsection (a)(1) if it has enacted and adheres to criteria for the licensing and authorization of adjusters that are functionally equivalent in meaning and effect to those set forth in a model act established pursuant to section 2 .

==(c) Reciprocity requirements– ==

The laws and regulations of a certain State shall be considered to provide for the reciprocity required under this subsection only if such laws and regulations—
:(1) do not require licensure of independent claims adjusters; or
:(2) permit any independent claims adjuster who has a license in another State that is the adjuster’s home State to obtain authorization to engage in the business of adjusting in such certain State as a non-resident to the same extent that such adjuster is permitted to practice in the adjuster’s home State, without satisfying any additional requirements other than, if required under applicable law, to submit—
::(A) proof of being licensed in good standing in the adjuster’s home State;Provided, That such home State has enacted laws and regulations governing individuals and entities authorized to operate as independent claims adjusters within such home State that are functionally equivalent in meaning and effect to those under any model act developed pursuant to section 2 ; and
::(B) payment of any requisite fee to the appropriate authority of the certain State;Provided, That the amount of such fee does not exceed any fee required to be paid by an adjuster whose home State is such certain State.

===(2) Continued review– ===

With respect to any State that the NAIC has determined to be in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a) , the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]hereby urges NAIC to continue to review and determine such State’s compliance with the requirements of subsection (a) on an annual basis. If the NAIC determines at any time that a State no longer is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (a) , section 6 shall apply with respect to such State.
