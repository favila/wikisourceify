{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to extend the application of the Medicare payment rate floor to primary care services furnished under Medicaid and to apply the rate floor to additional providers of primary care services.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Ensuring Access to Primary Care for Women & Children Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) Medicaid plays a key role in providing coverage for millions of working families.
:(2) Medicaid enrollees include families, pregnant women, children, individuals with disabilities, and other low-income individuals. Without Medicaid coverage, many enrollees would be uninsured or lack coverage for services they need.
:(3) In 2013, the Medicaid program covered 62,000,000 individuals, or 1 in every 5 Americans. This number will continue to grow, particularly since the Affordable Care Act significantly expanded eligibility to millions of uninsured adults. Enrollment in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program is projected to increase by 12,800,000 by 2016.
:(4) If all States expand their Medicaid programs, an estimated 7,000,000 women ages 18 to 64 would gain coverage under Medicaid.
:(5) In 47 States and in the District of Columbia, Medicaid pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for the same primary care services.
:(6) Multiple studies have concluded that higher Medicaid payment rates would increase the probability of primary care providers accepting new Medicaid patients, and would further support current Medicaid providers.
:(7)   [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has recognized that low provider participation in Medicaid decreases access to health care. To address this problem, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]acted to increase Medicaid payments for certain primary care services to be not less than the Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014.
:(8) As more Americans become insured and empowered participants in their own health care, demand for primary care services is expected to increase over the next few years.
:(9) Six in 10 women ages 18 to 44 (58 percent) report they see an obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physician on a regular basis. They are more likely to see their OB/GYN physician on a regular basis than any other type of provider. Given that women comprise the majority of Medicaid enrollees, it is critical that primary care providers, including OB/GYN physicians, receive sufficient reimbursement to participate in Medicaid.
:(10) Nurse practitioners and other mid-level health professionals deliver many primary care services. Applying Medicare’s rates for nurse practitioners and mid-level health professionals encourages greater participation in Medicaid, thereby increasing access to primary care, particularly in underserved areas.
:(11) The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures providers have the financial capability to serve their patients’ primary care needs. Furthermore, adding nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, and OB/GYN physicians serving in primary care settings increases access to critical health care services for women and children nationwide.
