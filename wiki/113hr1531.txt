=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) According to the National Cancer Institute, excluding cancers of the skin, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women.
:(2) According to the National Cancer Institute, an estimated 39,510 women and 410 men died from breast cancer in 2012.
:(3) According to the National Cancer Institute, in 2012 an estimated 226,870 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in women, and an estimated 2,190 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in men.
:(4) According to the American Cancer Society, most breast cancer patients undergo some type of surgical treatment, which may involve lumpectomy or mastectomy with removal of some of the axillary lymph nodes.
:(5) The offering and operation of health plans affect commerce among the States.
:(6) Health care providers located in a State serve patients who reside in the State and patients who reside in other States.
:(7) In order to provide for uniform treatment of health care providers and patients among the States, it is necessary to cover health plans operating in one State as well as health plans operating among the several States.

:(9) Breast cancer patients have reported adverse outcomes, including infection and inadequately controlled pain, resulting from premature hospital discharge following breast cancer surgery.

====(1) In general– ====

A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, that provides medical and surgical benefits shall ensure that inpatient (and in the case of a lumpectomy, outpatient) coverage and radiation therapy is provided for breast cancer treatment. Such plan or coverage may not—
:(A) insofar as the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, determines it to be medically necessary—
::(i) restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with a mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (such as a lumpectomy) for the treatment of breast cancer to less than 48 hours; or
::(ii) restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with a lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer to less than 24 hours; or
:(B) require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the issuer for prescribing any length of stay required under this paragraph.

====(2) Exception– ====

Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the provision of inpatient coverage if the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, determines that either a shorter period of hospital stay, or outpatient treatment, is medically appropriate.

===(b) Prohibition on certain modifications– ===

In implementing the requirements of this section, a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may not modify the terms and conditions of coverage based on the determination by a participant or beneficiary to request less than the minimum coverage required under subsection (a).

===(c) Notice– ===

A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, shall provide notice to each participant and beneficiary under such plan regarding the coverage required by this section in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary.

Such plan or issuer shall ensure that coverage is provided for such secondary consultation whether such consultation is based on a positive or negative initial diagnosis. In any case in which the attending physician certifies in writing that services necessary for such a secondary consultation are not sufficiently available from specialists operating under the plan with respect to whose services coverage is otherwise provided under such plan or by such issuer, such plan or issuer shall ensure that coverage is provided with respect to the services necessary for the secondary consultation with any other specialist selected by the attending physician for such purpose at no additional cost to the individual beyond that which the individual would have paid if the specialist was participating in the network of the plan.

====(2) Exception– ====

Nothing in paragraph (1)shall be construed as requiring the provision of secondary consultations where the patient determines not to seek such a consultation.

===(e) Prohibition on penalties or incentives– ===

A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may not—
:(1) penalize or otherwise reduce or limit the reimbursement of a provider or specialist because the provider or specialist provided care to a participant or beneficiary in accordance with this section;
:(2) provide financial or other incentives to a physician or specialist to induce the physician or specialist to keep the length of inpatient stays of patients following a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or a lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer below certain limits or to limit referrals for secondary consultations; or
:(3) provide financial or other incentives to a physician or specialist to induce the physician or specialist to refrain from referring a participant or beneficiary for a secondary consultation that would otherwise be covered by the plan or coverage involved under subsection (d)..
