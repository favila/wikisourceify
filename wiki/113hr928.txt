<blockquote>

=1860D–11A. Medicare operated prescription drug plan option=


==(a) In general==

Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, for each year (beginning with 2012), in addition to any plans offered under section 1860D–11 , the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]shall offer one or more Medicare operated prescription drug plans (as defined in subsection (c) ) with a service area that consists of the entire United States and shall enter into negotiations in accordance with subsection (b) with pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D drugs for eligible part D individuals who enroll in such a plan.
==(b) Negotiations==

Notwithstanding section 1860D–11(i) , for purposes of offering a Medicare operated prescription drug plan under this section, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]shall negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to the purchase price of covered part D drugs in a Medicare operated prescription drug plan and shall encourage the use of more affordable therapeutic equivalents to the extent such practices do not override medical necessity as determined by the prescribing physician. To the extent practicable and consistent with the previous sentence, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]shall implement strategies similar to those used by other Federal purchasers of prescription drugs, and other strategies, including the use of a formulary and formulary incentives in subsection (e) , to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D drugs.
==(c) Medicare operated prescription drug plan defined==

For purposes of this part, the term Medicare operated prescription drug plan means a prescription drug plan that offers qualified prescription drug coverage and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D–2(a)(1)(A) . Such a plan may offer supplemental prescription drug coverage in the same manner as other qualified prescription drug coverage offered by other prescription drug plans.
==(d) Monthly beneficiary premium==


===(1) Qualified prescription drug coverage===

The monthly beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D–2(a)(1)(A) to be charged under a Medicare operated prescription drug plan shall be uniform nationally. Such premium for months in 2014 and each succeeding year shall be based on the average monthly per capita actuarial cost of offering the Medicare operated prescription drug plan for the year involved, including administrative expenses.
===(2) Supplemental prescription drug coverage===

Insofar as a Medicare operated prescription drug plan offers supplemental prescription drug coverage, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]may adjust the amount of the premium charged under paragraph (1) .
==(e) Use of a formulary and formulary incentives==


===(1) In general===

With respect to the operation of a Medicare operated prescription drug plan, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]shall establish and apply a formulary (and may include formulary incentives described in paragraph (2)(C)(ii) ) in accordance with this subsection in order to—: increase patient safety;: increase appropriate use and reduce inappropriate use of drugs; and: reward value.
===(2) Development of initial formulary===

The [[Wikipedia:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ]]shall be responsible for assessing the clinical benefit of covered part D drugs and making recommendations to the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]regarding which drugs should be included in the formulary. In conducting such assessments and making such recommendations, the [[Wikipedia:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Director ]]shall—: consider safety concerns including those identified by the Federal [[Wikipedia:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration ]];: use available data and evaluations, with priority given to randomized controlled trials, to examine clinical effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, safety, and enhanced compliance with a drug regimen;: use the same classes of drugs developed by United States Pharmacopeia for this part;: consider evaluations made by—:: the [[Wikipedia:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Director ]]under section 1013 of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ;:: other Federal entities, such as the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs ]]; and:: other private and public entities, such as the Drug Effectiveness Review Project and Medicaid programs; and: recommend to the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]—:: those drugs in a class that provide a greater clinical benefit, including fewer safety concerns or less risk of side-effects, than another drug in the same class that should be included in the formulary;:: those drugs in a class that provide less clinical benefit, including greater safety concerns or a greater risk of side-effects, than another drug in the same class that should be excluded from the formulary; and:: drugs in a class with same or similar clinical benefit for which it would be appropriate for the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]to competitively bid (or negotiate) for placement on the formulary.
====(C) Consideration of AHRQ recommendations====


=====(i) In general=====

The [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]], after taking into consideration the recommendations under subparagraph (B)(v) , shall establish a formulary, and formulary incentives, to encourage use of covered part D drugs that—: have a lower cost and provide a greater clinical benefit than other drugs;: have a lower cost than other drugs with same or similar clinical benefit; and: drugs that have the same cost but provide greater clinical benefit than other drugs.

===(3) Limitations on formulary===

In any formulary established under this subsection, the formulary may not be changed during a year, except—: to add a generic version of a covered part D drug that entered the market;: to remove such a drug for which a safety problem is found; and: to add a drug that the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]identifies as a drug which treats a condition for which there has not previously been a treatment option or for which a clear and significant benefit has been demonstrated over other covered part D drugs.

====(E) Recommendations====

The advisory committee shall make recommendations to the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]]regarding—: whether a covered part D drug is found to provide a greater clinical benefit, including fewer safety concerns or less risk of side-effects, than another drug in the same class that is currently included in the formulary and should be included in the formulary;: whether a covered part D drug is found to provide less clinical benefit, including greater safety concerns or a greater risk of side-effects, than another drug in the same class that is currently included in the formulary and should not be included in the formulary; and: whether a covered part D drug has the same or similar clinical benefit to a drug in the same class that is currently included in the formulary and whether the drug should be included in the formulary.
