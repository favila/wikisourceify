{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2259 section 2259]of title 18, United States Code, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Amy and Vicky Child Pornography Victim Restitution Improvement Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The demand for child pornography harms children because it drives production, which involves severe and often irreparable child sexual abuse and exploitation.
:(2) The harms caused by child pornography are more extensive than the harms caused by child sex abuse alone because child pornography is a permanent record of the abuse of the depicted child, and the harm to the child is exacerbated by its circulation. Every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim's original childhood sexual abuse.
:(3) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals have viewed and will in the future view images of their childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason that child pornography is outlawed.
:(4) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a victim’s childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining and aggravating the harms to that individual victim. Multiple actors independently commit intentional crimes that combine to produce an indivisible injury to a victim.
:(5) It is the intent of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that victims of child pornography be fully compensated for all the harms resulting from each and every perpetrator who contributes to their anguish.
:(6)   [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]intends to adopt and hereby adopts an aggregate causation standard to address the unique crime of child pornography and the unique harms caused by child pornography.
:(7) Victims should not be limited to receiving restitution from defendants only for losses caused by each defendant’s own offense of conviction. Courts must apply a less restrictive aggregate causation standard in child pornography cases, while also recognizing appropriate constitutional limits and protections for defendants. 

=Sec. 3. Mandatory restitution=

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2259  Section 2259of title 18, United States Code], is amended—
