Amounts received by the United States as royalties under this subsection shall be deposited into the Treasury.

====(b) Duties of claim holders, operators, and transporters– ====

Such responsibility for the periods referred to in the preceding sentence shall include any and all additional amounts billed by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] and determined to be due by final agency or judicial action. Any person liable for royalty payments under this section who assigns any payment obligation shall remain jointly and severally liable for all royalty payments due for the claim for the period.
:(3) A person conducting mineral activities shall—
::(A) develop and comply with the site security provisions in the operations permit designed to protect from theft the locatable minerals, concentrates or products derived therefrom which are produced or stored on a mining claim, and such provisions shall conform with such minimum standards as the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] may prescribe by rule, taking into account the variety of circumstances on mining claims; and
::(B) not later than the 5th business day after production begins anywhere on a mining claim, or production resumes after more than 90 days after production was suspended, notify the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] , in the manner prescribed by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] , of the date on which such production has begun or resumed.
:(4) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] may by rule require any person engaged in transporting a locatable mineral, concentrate, or product derived there from to carry on his or her person, in his or her vehicle, or in his or her immediate control, documentation showing, at a minimum, the amount, origin, and intended destination of the locatable mineral, concentrate, or product derived there from in such circumstances as the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] determines is appropriate.

====(c) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements– ====


:(1) A claim holder, operator, or other person directly involved in developing, producing, processing, transporting, purchasing, or selling locatable minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom, subject to this title, through the point of royalty computation shall establish and maintain any records, make any reports, and provide any information that the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] may reasonably require for the purposes of implementing this section or determining compliance with rules or orders under this section. Such records shall include, but not be limited to, periodic reports, records, documents, and other data. Such reports may also include, but not be limited to, pertinent technical and financial data relating to the quantity, quality, composition volume, weight, and assay of all minerals extracted from the mining claim. Upon the request of any officer or employee duly designated by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] conducting an audit or investigation pursuant to this section, the appropriate records, reports, or information that may be required by this section shall be made available for inspection and duplication by such officer or employee. Failure by a claim holder, operator, or other person referred to in the first sentence to cooperate with such an audit, provide data required by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] , or grant access to information may, at the discretion of the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] , result in involuntary forfeiture of the claim.
:(2) Records required by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] under this section shall be maintained for 7 years after release of financial assurance under section 136 unless the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] notifies the operator that the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] has initiated an audit or investigation involving such records and that such records must be maintained for a longer period. In any case when an audit or investigation is underway, records shall be maintained until the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] releases the operator of the obligation to maintain such records.

====(d) Audits– ====

The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] is authorized to conduct such audits of all claim holders, operators, transporters, purchasers, processors, or other persons directly or indirectly involved in the production or sales of minerals covered by this title, as the Secretary deems necessary for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the requirements of this section. For purposes of performing such audits, the Secretary shall, at reasonable times and upon request, have access to, and may copy, all books, papers and other documents that relate to compliance with any provision of this section by any person.

====(e) Cooperative agreements– ====


:(1) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] is authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] of Agriculture to share information concerning the royalty management of locatable minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom, to carry out inspection, auditing, investigation, or enforcement (not including the collection of royalties, civil or criminal penalties, or other payments) activities under this section in cooperation with the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] , and to carry out any other activity described in this section.
:(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection(relating to trade secrets), and pursuant to a cooperative agreement, the [[w:Rural Utilities Service|Secretary of Agriculture]] shall, upon request, have access to all royalty accounting information in the possession of the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] respecting the production, removal, or sale of locatable minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom from claims on lands open to location under this title.

====(f) Interest and substantial underreporting assessments– ====


:(1) In the case of mining claims where royalty payments are not received by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] on the date that such payments are due, the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall charge interest on such underpayments at the same interest rate as the rate applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In the case of an underpayment, interest shall be computed and charged only on the amount of the deficiency and not on the total amount.
:(2) If there is any underreporting of royalty owed on production from a claim for any production month by any person liable for royalty payments under this section, the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall assess a penalty of not greater than 25 percent of the amount of that underreporting.
:(3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term underreporting means the difference between the royalty on the value of the production that should have been reported and the royalty on the value of the production which was reported, if the value that should have been reported is greater than the value that was reported.
:(4) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] may waive or reduce the assessment provided in paragraph (2) of this subsectionif the person liable for royalty payments under this section corrects the underreporting before the date such person receives notice from the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] that an underreporting may have occurred, or before 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, whichever is later.
:(5) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall waive any portion of an assessment under paragraph (2) of this subsectionattributable to that portion of the underreporting for which the person responsible for paying the royalty demonstrates that—

::(B) such person had substantial authority for reporting royalty on the value of the production on the basis on which it was reported;
::(C) such person previously had notified the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] , in such manner as the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] may by rule prescribe, of relevant reasons or facts affecting the royalty treatment of specific production which led to the underreporting; or
