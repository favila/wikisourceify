====={{anchor|H9E7CCDE61D434B46A658A0EBF531E3CB}}(ii) Information– =====

To fulfill the requirement under clause (i), the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] shall rely on information that it routinely collects or that is publicly available.

A participating broadband service provider need not be an eligible telecommunications carrier to receive support under such program, but such provider shall obtain authorization from the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] in order to participate in the program.
