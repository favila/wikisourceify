=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously declared the independence of the 13 colonies, and the achievement of peace was recognized as one of the highest duties of the new organization of free and independent States by declaring, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.” 
:(2) The Constitution of the United States of America, in its Preamble, further sets forth the insurance of the cause of peace in stating: “We the People of the United States, in Order to Form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity” .
:(3) During the course of the 20th century, more than 100,000,000 people perished in wars. The United States has been at war over the past decade, with 6,600 members of the Armed Forces and hundreds of thousands of civilians estimated to have been killed in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
:(4) Every year 300,000 people are killed by gun violence around the world. In the United States, 100,000 people are shot each year in murders, assaults, suicides and suicide attempts, accidents, and police actions. Over 30,000 people die each year of gunshot wounds, 12,000 of whom are murdered. Every day, 50 children are shot, and 8 of those children die.
:(5) A 2004 [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] report estimates that interpersonal violence within the United States costs approximately $300 billion annually, not including war-related costs. The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] states that an average of 16 people age 10 to 24 were murdered each day in the United States in 2005. The Pew Charitable Trust calculates that child abuse and neglect in the United States cost $103.8 billion in 2007.
:(6) In 1999, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] adopted a Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, stating that a culture of peace is an integral approach to preventing violence and violent conflicts, an alternative to the culture of war and violence, and is based on education for peace, the promotion of sustainable economic and social development, respect for human rights, equality between women and men, democratic participation, tolerance, and the free flow of information and disarmament. The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] declared the years 2001 through 2010 an International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World and the United Nations supports a culture of peace going forward.
:(7) On April 4, 2012, the Institute for Economics and Peace released a United States Peace Index, which assessed peacefulness at the State and city levels and analyzed the costs associated with violence and the socio-economic measures associated with peace. While violence within the United States had declined over the year 2011, violence and violence containment still cost the average taxpayer $3,257. The total cost of violence to the United States—including lost productivity from violence—was conservatively calculated to be over $460 billion.
:(8) A study by the Institute for Economics and Peace released September 20, 2012, reports conservative estimates for 2010, that 15 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States, or $15,000 per taxpayer, was spent on containing violence. The study included government, corporate, and individual expenditure, regardless of whether it was related to international affairs such as offshore military activities, or domestic spending such as dealing with crime and the consequences of crime.
:(9) Violence prevention is cost effective. For every dollar spent in violence prevention and peacebuilding, many lives and many dollars are saved. The philosophy and techniques of nonviolence and the science of peacebuilding provide tools and techniques that can be applied not only at the levels of individual and community growth, but also within the Federal Government and at national and international levels.
:(10) Peacebuilding is defined by the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] as a range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management, and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace and development. Peacebuilding is built upon research into the root causes of violence in the United States and the world, through promotion and promulgation of effective policies and programs that ameliorate those root causes of violence, and through providing all citizens, organizations, and governmental bodies with opportunities to learn about and practice the essential tools of nonviolent conflict resolution and peacebuilding.
:(11) In 2000, the Earth Charter Commission released the Earth Charter, an international declaration of fundamental values and principles created to build a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society. The preamble of the Earth Charter provides, “To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace.” Peacebuilding is working together with all nations to protect both life and land and hold the Earth in balance.
