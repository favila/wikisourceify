Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President should award the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously to Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both of whom died from enemy action during the attack on United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on the night of September 11–12, 2012.Whereas on September 11, 2012, United States facilities and personnel in Benghazi, Libya, were attacked by militants with ties to Islamist terrorist groups;Whereas four Americans were killed in the attack: Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods;Whereas Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were former Navy SEALs serving as security personnel in Libya who, as the attack unfolded, fought valiently to defend American property and protect United States personnel;Whereas their small security team was thrown into action in the face of enemies who were better armed with heavier weapons and who greatly outnumbered the Americans, and in ensuing combat, Woods and Doherty sacrificed their own lives in the effort to save the lives of others;Whereas according to Executive Order 1086, signed by President John F. Kennedy on February 22, 1963, the first listed criterion for the award of the Medal of Freedom by the President is to “any person who has made an especially meritorious contribution to … the security or national interests of the United States” , which is a description that clearly fits both Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods: Now, therefore, be it
