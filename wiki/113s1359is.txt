This Act may be cited as the “Clean Cruise Ship Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) cruise ships carry millions of passengers through North American waters each year, showcase some of the most beautiful ocean and coastal environments in the United States, and provide opportunities for passengers to relax and enjoy oceans and marine ecosystems;
:(2) the natural beauty and health of the ocean and coastal environment is what draws passengers to travel along these waterways by ship;
:(3) protecting the natural environment is beneficial to both the environment and to the cruise industry;
:(4) the number of cruise passengers continues to grow, making the cruise industry 1 of the fastest growing tourism sectors in the world;
:(5) in 2010, more than 10,000,000 passengers departed from North America on thousands of cruise ships;
:(6) as of 2010, the average annual growth rate of cruise passengers is 7.5 percent;
:(7) during the 2 decades preceding the date of enactment of this Act, the average cruise ship size has increased at a rate of approximately 90 feet every 5 years;
:(8) an average-sized cruise vessel generates millions of gallons of liquid waste and many tons of solid waste;
:(9) in just 1 week, a 3,000-passenger cruise ship generates approximately 200,000 gallons of human sewage, more than 1,000,000 gallons of water from showers and sinks and dishwashing water (commonly known as “graywater” ), more than 8 tons of solid waste, and toxic wastes from dry cleaning and photo-processing laboratories;
:(10) in an [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] survey of 29 ships traveling in Alaskan waters, reported sewage generation rates ranged from 1,000 to 74,000 gallons per day per vessel, with the average volume of sewage generated being 21,000 gallons per day per vessel;
:(11) those frequently untreated cruise ship discharges deliver nutrients, hazardous substances, pharmaceuticals, and human pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, directly into the marine environment;
:(12) in the final report of the [[w:|United States Commission on Ocean Policy]] , that [[w:|Commission]] found that cruise ship discharges, if not treated and disposed of properly, and the cumulative impacts caused when cruise ships repeatedly visit the same environmentally sensitive areas, “can be a significant source of pathogens and nutrients with the potential to threaten human health and damage shellfish beds, coral reefs, and other aquatic life” ;
:(13) pollution from cruise ships not only has the potential to threaten marine life and human health through consumption of contaminated seafood, but also poses a health risk for recreational swimmers, surfers, and other beachgoers;
:(14) according to the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] , “Sewage may host many pathogens of concern to human health, including Salmonella, Shigella, Hepatitis A and E, and gastro-intestinal viruses. Sewage contamination in swimming areas and shellfish beds poses potential risks to human health and the environment by increasing the rate of waterborne illnesses” ;
:(15) the nutrient pollution from human sewage discharges from cruise ships can contribute to the incidence of harmful algal blooms;
:(16) algal blooms have been implicated in the deaths of marine life, including the deaths of more than 150 manatees off the coast of Florida;
:(17) in a 2005 report requested by the International Council of Cruise Lines, the Science Panel of the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance recommended that—
::(A) <nowiki>“[a]ll blackwater should be treated”;</nowiki>
::(B) treated blackwater should be “avoided in ports, close to bathing beaches or water bodies with restricted circulation, flushing or inflow”; and
::(C) blackwater should not be discharged within 4 nautical miles of shellfish beds, coral reefs, or other sensitive habitats;
:(18) that Science Panel further recommended that graywater be treated in the same manner as blackwater and that sewage sludge be off-loaded to approved land-based facilities;
:(19) in a summary of recommendations for addressing unabated point sources of pollution, the Pew Oceans Commission states that, “ [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] should enact legislation that regulates wastewater discharges from cruise ships under the Clean Water Actby establishing uniform minimum standards for discharges in all State waters and prohibiting discharges within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that do not meet effluent standards.”; and
:(20) a comprehensive statutory regime for managing pollution discharges from cruise vessels, applicable throughout the United States, is needed—
::(A) to protect coastal and ocean areas from pollution generated by cruise vessels;
::(B) to reduce and better regulate discharges from cruise vessels; and
::(C) to improve monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of standards regarding discharges.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1251 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.] )to establish national standards and prohibitions for discharges from cruise vessels.
