[[w:John Sarbanes|Mr. Sarbanes]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize competitive grants to prepare and train school principals on effective core competencies and instructional leadership skills.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Instructional Leadership Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) According to a 2004 study commissioned by the Wallace Foundation entitled “How Leadership Influences Student Learning” , principals are second only to teachers in impacting increased student academic achievement (Leithwood, Louis, Whalstrom).
:(2) According to education research conducted by the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in 2010 entitled “Principal Effectiveness and Leadership in an Era of Accountability: What Research Says” , a school principal must serve as both an organizational leader and most importantly, is expected to be an instructional leader, meaning the principal must possess the knowledge and instructional skills to guide teaching and learning in a school (Rice).
:(3) There is a clear intention within the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] ] )that principals become instructional leaders. Section 2113(c) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6613 20 U.S.C. 6613(c)] ] )calls for principals to have—
::(A) the instructional leadership skills to help teachers teach and students learn; and
::(B) to help students meet challenging State student academic achievement standards.
:(4) Despite this recognition of the importance of instructional leadership, adequate attention and resources have not been committed to training and supporting school principals—
::(A) in meeting the standards of instructional leadership in States where such standards exist; and
::(B) in developing such standards in States where such standards do not exist.
:(5) Licensure of school principals typically does not give adequate emphasis to instructional leadership skills in the certification process.
:(6) The term highly qualified principal added by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] )should be defined in such Act to include a strong emphasis on instructional leadership.
