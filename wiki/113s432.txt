:(7) Enhanced trade with least-developed Muslim countries, including Afghanistan and Bangladesh, is consistent with other United States objectives of encouraging a strong private sector and individual economic empowerment in those countries.
:(8) Offering least-developed countries enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of positive economic and political developments throughout the world.
:(9) Encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers will enhance the benefits of trade and investment as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and the countries designated for benefits under this Act.
