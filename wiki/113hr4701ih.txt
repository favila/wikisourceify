====(C) Recommendations– ====

Recommendations for appropriate actions that should be taken to advance research in the areas described in subparagraph (A)(i) and to address the research questions identified in subparagraph (B) , as well as for appropriate benchmarks to measure progress on achieving such action, including the following:

=====(i) Researchers– =====

Ensuring adequate availability of individuals described in subparagraph (A)(iv) .

=====(ii) Coordinated research initiatives– =====

Promoting and developing initiatives and partnerships described in subparagraph (A)(v) .

=====(iii) Research resources– =====

Developing additional public and private resources described in subparagraph (A)(vi) and strengthening existing resources.

===(3) Timing– ===



====(A) Initial development and subsequent update– ====

For each vector-borne disease identified under subsection (b)(1) , the Directors shall—
:(i) develop a scientific framework under this subsection not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this section; and
:(ii) review and update the scientific framework not later than 5 years after its initial development.

====(B) Other updates– ====

The Directors may review and update each scientific framework developed under this subsection as necessary.

===(4) Public Notice– ===

With respect to each scientific framework developed under this subsection, not later than 30 days after the date of completion of the framework, the Directors shall—
:(A) submit such framework to the [[w:United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]and the [[w:United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives]], and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations of the Senate]]; and
:(B) make such framework publicly available on the Internet Web site of the Department of Health and Human Services.

==(b) Identification of vector-Borne diseases– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this section, the Directors shall identify 2 or more bacterial or parasitic vector-borne diseases that each have a high incidence domestically.

===(2) Treating tick-borne diseases as a single vector-borne disease– ===

For purposes of identifying vector-borne diseases under this subsection and developing scientific frameworks for such diseases under subsection (a) , tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases that are known to be transmitted by ticks to humans in the United States, shall be treated as a single vector-borne disease.

===(3) Additional vector-borne diseases– ===

Subject to paragraph (2) , the Directors may, at any time, identify other vector-borne diseases for purposes of this section. In identifying a vector-borne disease pursuant to the previous sentence, the Directors may consider additional metrics of progress against such type of vector-borne disease.

==(c) Working groups– ==



===(1) In general– ===

For each vector-borne disease identified under subsection (b) , the Directors shall convene a working group in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act . The Directors (or their designees) shall participate in the meetings of each such working group.
