At the end of chapter 54of title 39, United States Code, add the following:

<blockquote> 

==Sec. 5404. Contracts for foreign and interstate air transportation==



===(a) Definitions– ===

In this section—
:(1) the terms air carrier , foreign air carrier , foreign air transportation , and interstate air transportation have the meanings given such terms in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/40102  section 40102(a)of title 49];
:(2) the term certificated air carrier means an air carrier that holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/41102  section 41102(a)of title 49];
:(3) the term code-share relationship means a relationship pursuant to which any certificated air carrier or foreign air carrier’s designation code is used to identify a flight operated by another air carrier or foreign air carrier; and
:(4) the term Secretary means the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]].

===(b) International mail– ===



====(1) In general– ====



=====(A) Use of certificated air carriers; code-share relationships– =====

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]may contract for the transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the points in foreign air transportation only with certificated air carriers. A contract may be awarded to a certificated air carrier to transport mail by air between any of the points in foreign air transportation that the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]has authorized the carrier to serve either directly or through a code-share relationship with 1 or more foreign air carriers.

=====(B) Use of foreign air carriers– =====

If the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]has sought offers or proposals from certificated air carriers to transport mail in foreign air transportation between points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, and has not received offers or proposals that meet [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]requirements at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 such carriers, the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]may seek offers or proposals from foreign air carriers. Where service in foreign air transportation meeting the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]’s requirements is unavailable at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 certificated air carriers, either directly or through a code-share relationship with 1 or more foreign air carriers, the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]may contract with foreign air carriers to provide the service sought if, when the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]seeks offers or proposals from foreign air carriers, it also seeks an offer or proposal to provide that service from any certificated air carrier providing service between those points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, on the same terms and conditions that are being sought from foreign air carriers.

=====(C) Methodology for determining fair and reasonable prices– =====

For purposes of this subsection, the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]shall use a methodology for determining fair and reasonable prices for the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]designated region or regions developed in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest.

=====(D) Ceiling prices– =====

For purposes of this subsection, ceiling prices determined pursuant to the methodology used under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/5404 subparagraph (C)]shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable if they do not exceed the ceiling prices derived from—
:(i) a weighted average based on market rate data furnished by the International Air Transport Association or a subsidiary unit thereof; or
:(ii) if such data are not available from those sources, such other neutral, regularly updated set of weighted average market rates as the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]], with the concurrence of certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest, may designate.

=====(E) Situations in which concurrence cannot be attained– =====

If, for purposes of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/5404 subparagraph (D)(ii)], concurrence cannot be attained, the most recently available market rate data described in this paragraph shall continue to apply for the relevant market or markets.

====(2) Contract process– ====

The [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]shall contract for foreign air transportation as set forth in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/5404 paragraph (1)]through an open procurement process that will provide—
:(A) potential offerors with timely notice of business opportunities in sufficient detail to allow them to make a proposal;
:(B) requirements, proposed terms and conditions, and evaluation criteria to potential offerors; and
:(C) an opportunity for unsuccessful offerors to receive prompt feedback upon request.

====(3) Emergency or unanticipated conditions; inadequate lift space– ====

The [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]may enter into contracts to transport mail by air in foreign air transportation with a certificated air carrier or a foreign air carrier without complying with the requirements of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/5404 paragraph (1)]or[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/5404 (2)]if—
:(A) emergency or unanticipated conditions exist that make it impractical for the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]to comply with such requirements; or
:(B) the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]’s demand for lift exceeds the space available to the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]under existing contracts and—
::(i) there is insufficient time available to seek additional lift using procedures that comply with those requirements without compromising the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]’s service commitments to its own customers; and
::(ii) the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]first offers any certificated air carrier holding a contract to carry mail between the relevant points the opportunity to carry such excess volumes under the terms of its existing contract.

===(c) Good-Faith effort required– ===

The [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]and potential offerors shall put a good-faith effort into resolving disputes concerning the award of contracts made under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/5404 subsection (b)].

===(d) Special circumstances– ===

If the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]determines that service by certificated air carriers or combination of air carriers between any pair or pairs of points in foreign air transportation is not adequate for its purposes, the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]may contract, without advertising for bids, in such manner and under such terms and conditions as the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]may deem appropriate, with any air taxi operator or combination thereof for such air transportation service.
