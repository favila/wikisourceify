{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish a 5-year demonstration program to provide skills to classroom teachers and staff who work with children with autism spectrum disorders.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Autism Understanding and Training in School Methodologies for Educators Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) Autism is a group of complex developmental brain disorders collectively referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) that can cause a wide range of symptoms, skills, and levels of impairment including social, communication and behavior changes.
:(2) Autism spectrum disorders are also referred to as pervasive developmental disorders and include subcategories of classic autism with ranges from high functioning autism (HFA) to low functioning autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified (PDD–NOS), as well as more severe cases of Rhett Syndrome and Child Disintegrative Disorder.
:(3) Autism affects an estimated 1 in 88 children by age 8 and 1 in 54 boys.
:(4) An estimated 1,500,000 individuals in the United States are affected by autism.
:(5) More children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with AIDS, diabetes, and cancer combined.
:(6) Autism is the fastest growing serious developmental disability in the United States.
:(7) Autism costs the Nation over $35,000,000,000 per year, a figure expected to significantly increase in the next decade.
:(8) Boys are five times more likely than girls to have autism.
:(9) There is currently no medical cure for autism, but there are evidence-based educational methods proven to be effective in improving outcomes for students with autism and research demonstrating the benefits of routine and consistency.
:(10) The least restrictive environment for educating students with autism spectrum disorder, including, but not limited to, students with high functioning autism, Asperger syndrome, and PDD–NOS, often is best achieved by enrollment in a general education classroom with proper support.
:(11) General education classroom teachers and staff often are not adequately trained to work effectively with students with autism spectrum disorders, who have a wide diversity of characteristics, although such skills may be attained through qualified training programs and may be relatively easy to implement in school settings.
:(12) Training general education classroom teachers and staff to implement evidence-based practices for educating students with autism spectrum disorders with accuracy and fidelity will help provide for best possible outcomes not only for students with autism, but also for other students in the classroom.
:(13) Children with autism in highly transient families, such as the military (where the rate of children on the spectrum is even higher) and foreign service families, often face additional challenges in the public education system because of frequent changes in the family’s geographic duty station or a parent’s deployment, which can interrupt the provision of appropriate interventions and continuity of effective educational methods.
:(14) In school districts that have a large population of transient families or that border military bases it is especially important to have staff who are highly trained to provide effective services and build a proven track record of academic achievement in serving students with autism.
