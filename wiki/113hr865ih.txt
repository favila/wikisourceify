To establish the African Burial Ground International Memorial Museum and Educational Center in New York, New York, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “African Burial Ground International Memorial Museum and Educational Center Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the African Burial Ground National Historic Landmark in New York, New York, holds the remains of up to 20,000 enslaved Africans and early-generation African-Americans from the colonial era;
:(2) the Africans and African-Americans that suffered under slavery show us the strength of the human character and provide us with a model of courage, commitment, and perseverance;
:(3) as President George W. Bush stated on July 8, 2003, during his remarks at Goree Island, Senegal: “For 250 years the captives endured an assault on their culture and their dignity. The spirit of Africans in America did not break. … All the generations of oppression under the laws of man could not crush the hope of freedom and defeat the purposes of God.”;
:(4) on February 27, 2006, President George W. Bush established the National Monument, which was comprised of the approximately 15,000-square-foot parcel of the National Historic Landmark that was bounded by Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattan;
:(5) an international memorial museum facility dedicated to those individuals who suffered the grave injustice of slavery in the United States, while at the same time helping to build the country, would—
::(A) reflect the significance of the African Burial Ground; and
::(B) help the people of the United States understand the past and honor the history of all people in the United States;
:(6) in 1998, the [[w:Smithsonian Institution|Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution]] —
::(A) stated that the African Burial Ground affords the perfect opportunity to gain insight into—
:::(i) the institution of slavery, as practiced in urban, rural, northern, and southern parts of the United States; and
:::(ii) the international slave trade; and
::(B) proposed that a partnership be formed among the Smithsonian, the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]] , and the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] to further develop the African Burial Ground;
:(7) the National Museum of African American History and Culture Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/80r 20 U.S.C. 80r et seq.] ), which authorized construction of a museum in Washington, DC, identified the period of slavery as one of the periods of the African-American diaspora that would be encompassed by the museum;
:(8) the African Burial Ground—
::(A) is unlike any other anthropological and symbolic site in the United States or the world;
::(B) includes DNA samples from the remarkably well-preserved human remains that will enable researchers to trace the home roots in Africa of those individuals buried at the African Burial Ground; and
::(C) provides a fitting location for a national memorial facility, relating to the National Museum of African American History and Culture that would—
:::(i) pay special tribute to—
::::(I) the thousands of enslaved individuals who are buried at the African Burial Ground; and
::::(II) all of the individuals who were enslaved during the history of the United States;
:::(ii) examine the African cultural traditions brought to the United States by the enslaved; and
:::(iii) explore in-depth the institution of slavery;
:(9) a memorial museum at the site of the African Burial Ground—
::(A) was first recommended by a Federal steering committee in 1992; and
::(B) in conjunction with the planned World Trade Center memorial and other nearby sites, would attract millions of visitors from the United States and abroad, making a substantial contribution to the development and revitalization of Lower Manhattan in response to the attacks on the World Trade Center of September 11, 2001;
:(10) [[Public Law 99-511|Public Law 99–511]] (100 Stat. 2080)encouraged support for the establishment of a commemorative structure within the [[w:National Park Service|National Park System]] or on other Federal land that is dedicated to the promotion of understanding, knowledge, opportunity, and equality for all people;
:(11) similar to the National Museum of the Native American that was established by section 3(a) of the National Museum of the American Indian Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/80q–1 20 U.S.C. 80q–1(a)] ), a memorial museum at the site of the African Burial Ground would benefit from a partnership among—
::(A) the Federal Government;
::(B) the State of New York;
::(C) the city of New York; and
::(D) members of the private sector;
:(12) the African Burial Ground—
::(A) has been determined to be nationally significant as—
:::(i) a National Historic Landmark; and
:::(ii) a National Monument; and
::(B) provides an important opportunity for interpretation, understanding, partnership and pride; and
:(13) the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]] —
::(A) has played an important role in the development of the African Burial Ground (including the designation of the African Burial Ground as a National Monument);
::(B) successfully operates other national facilities in the city of New York that symbolize freedom and the quest for freedom in America, including—
:::(i) the Statue of Liberty National Monument; and
:::(ii) Ellis Island National Monument;
::(C) provided key support to the Presidential Study Commission for the National Museum of African American History and Culture; and
::(D) is well-suited to assume a leadership role with respect to the creation of the Museum.
