{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for auditable financial statements for the Department of Defense, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Audit the Pentagon Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Section 9 of article I of the Constitution of the United States requires all agencies of the Federal Government, including the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] , to publish “a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money” .
:(2)  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3515 Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code] , requires the agencies of the Federal Government, including the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] , to present auditable financial statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] has not complied with this law.
:(3) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3512 31 U.S.C. 3512note] )requires financial systems acquired by the Federal Government, including the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] , to be able to provide information to leaders to manage and control the cost of Government. The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] has not complied with this law.
:(4) The financial management of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] has been on the High-Risk list of the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] , which means that the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] is not consistently able to “<nowiki>control costs; ensure basic accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; [and] prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse</nowiki>” .
:(5) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002([[Public Law 107-107|[[Public Law -|Public Law 107–107]] ]] )requires the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] to report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] annually on the reliability of the financial statements of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] , to minimize resources spent on producing unreliable financial statements, and to use resources saved to improve financial management policies, procedures, and internal controls.
:(6) In 2005, the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] created a Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a directorate within the office of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)]] , to improve [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] business processes with the goal of producing timely, reliable, and accurate financial information that could generate an audit-ready annual financial statement. In December 2005, that directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first of a series of semiannual reports on the status of the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.
:(7) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010([[Public Law 111-84|[[Public Law -|Public Law 111–84]] ]] )requires regular status reports on the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described in paragraph (6), and codified as a statutory requirement the goal of the Plan in ensuring that [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] financial statements are validated as ready for audit not later than September 30, 2017. In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013([[Public Law 112-239|Public Law 112–239]] )requires that the statement of budgetary resources of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] be validated as ready for audit by not later than September 30, 2014.
:(8) At a September 2010 hearing of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] , the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] stated that past expenditures by the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] of $5,800,000,000 to improve financial information, and billions of dollars more of anticipated expenditures on new information technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] . At that hearing, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] could not predict when the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.
:(9) At a 2013 hearing of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] , [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Chuck Hagel affirmed his commitment to audit-ready budget statements for the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] by the end of 2014, and stated that he “will do everything he can to fulfill this commitment” . At that hearing, Secretary Hagel noted that auditable financial statements were essential to the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department]] not only for improving the quality of its financial information, but also for reassuring the public and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that it is a good steward of public funds.
