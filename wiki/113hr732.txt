{{section|H31C17314B3B54F96A8C3630AB5F79D13|2431. Transportation of minors in circumvention of certain laws relating to abortion}}
(a)
Offense
(1)
Generally
Except
				as provided in subsection (b)
, whoever knowingly transports a minor across a
				State line, with the intent that such minor obtain an abortion, and thereby in
				fact abridges the right of a parent under a law requiring parental involvement
				in a minor’s abortion decision, in force in the State where the minor resides,
				shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or
				both.

(2)
Definition
For
				the purposes of this subsection, an abridgement of the right of a parent occurs
				if an abortion is performed or induced on the minor, in a State or a foreign
				nation other than the State where the minor resides, without the parental
				consent or notification, or the judicial authorization, that would have been
				required by that law had the abortion been performed in the State where the
				minor resides.


(b)
Exceptions
(1)
The prohibition of
				subsection (a)
 does not apply if the abortion was necessary to save the life of
				the minor because her life was endangered by a physical disorder, physical
				injury, or physical illness, including a life endangering physical condition
				caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.

(2)
A minor
				transported in violation of this section, and any parent of that minor, may not
				be prosecuted or sued for a violation of this section, a conspiracy to violate
				this section, or an offense under section 2
 or 3 of this title
 based on a
				violation of this section.


(c)
Affirmative
				Defense
It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution for an
				offense, or to a civil action, based on a violation of this section that the
				defendant—
(1)
reasonably
				believed, based on information the defendant obtained directly from a parent of
				the minor, that before the minor obtained the abortion, the parental consent or
				notification took place that would have been required by the law requiring
				parental involvement in a minor’s abortion decision, had the abortion been
				performed in the State where the minor resides; or

(2)
was presented with
				documentation showing with a reasonable degree of certainty that a court in the
				minor’s State of residence waived any parental notification required by the
				laws of that State, or otherwise authorized that the minor be allowed to
				procure an abortion.


(d)
Civil
				Action
Any parent who suffers harm from a violation of subsection
				(a)
 may obtain appropriate relief in a civil action unless the parent has
				committed an act of incest with the minor subject to subsection (a)
.

(e)
Definitions
For
				the purposes of this section—
(1)
the term
				abortion
 means the use or prescription of any instrument,
				medicine, drug, or any other substance or device—
(A)
to intentionally
				kill the unborn child of a woman known to be pregnant; or

(B)
to intentionally
				prematurely terminate the pregnancy of a woman known to be pregnant, with an
				intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth or of
				preserving the life or health of the child after live birth, or to remove a
				dead unborn child;


(2)
the term law
				requiring parental involvement in a minor’s abortion decision
 means a
				law—
(A)

				an abortion is performed on a minor, either—
(i)
the notification
				to, or consent of, a parent of that minor; or

(ii)

				State court; and


(B)
that does not
				provide as an alternative to the requirements described in subparagraph (A)

				notification to or consent of any person or entity who is not described in that
				subparagraph;


(3)
the term
				minor
 means an individual who is not older than the maximum age
				requiring parental notification or consent, or proceedings in a State court,
				under the law requiring parental involvement in a minor’s abortion
				decision;

(4)
the term
				parent
 means—
(A)
a parent or
				guardian;

(B)
a legal custodian;
				or

(C)
a person standing
				in loco parentis who has care and control of the minor, and with whom the minor
				regularly resides, who is designated by the law requiring parental involvement
				in the minor’s abortion decision as a person to whom notification, or from whom
				consent, is required; and


(5)
the term
