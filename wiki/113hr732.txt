Except as provided in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2431 subsection (b)] , whoever knowingly transports a minor across a State line, with the intent that such minor obtain an abortion, and thereby in fact abridges the right of a parent under a law requiring parental involvement in a minor’s abortion decision, in force in the State where the minor resides, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

====(2) Definition– ====

For the purposes of this subsection, an abridgement of the right of a parent occurs if an abortion is performed or induced on the minor, in a State or a foreign nation other than the State where the minor resides, without the parental consent or notification, or the judicial authorization, that would have been required by that law had the abortion been performed in the State where the minor resides.

===(b) Exceptions– ===


:(1) The prohibition of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2431 subsection (a)] does not apply if the abortion was necessary to save the life of the minor because her life was endangered by a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a life endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.
:(2) A minor transported in violation of this section, and any parent of that minor, may not be prosecuted or sued for a violation of this section, a conspiracy to violate this section, or an offense under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2 section 2] or[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3 3 of this title] based on a violation of this section.

===(c) Affirmative Defense– ===

It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution for an offense, or to a civil action, based on a violation of this section that the defendant—

:(2) was presented with documentation showing with a reasonable degree of certainty that a court in the minor’s State of residence waived any parental notification required by the laws of that State, or otherwise authorized that the minor be allowed to procure an abortion.

===(d) Civil Action– ===

Any parent who suffers harm from a violation of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2431 subsection (a)] may obtain appropriate relief in a civil action unless the parent has committed an act of incest with the minor subject to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2431 subsection (a)] .
