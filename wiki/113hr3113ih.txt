{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title III of the Public Health Service Act to provide for the establishment and implementation of guidelines on best practices for diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBIs) in school-aged children, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act of 2013 ”or the“ ConTACT Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Concussions are mild traumatic brain injuries, the long-term effects of which are not well understood.
:(2) According to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]](CDC), each year United States emergency departments treat an estimated 173,285 sports- and recreation-related mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBIs), including concussions, among children and adolescents, from birth to 19 years of age. However, this number does not capture the total number, as many MTBIs go undiagnosed.
:(3) There is an increased risk for subsequent brain injuries among persons who have had at least one previous brain injury.
:(4) A repeat concussion, one that occurs before the brain recovers from a previous concussion, can slow recovery or increase the likelihood of having long-term problems.
:(5) In rare cases, repeat concussions can result in second impact syndrome, which can be marked by brain swelling, permanent brain damage, and death.
:(6) Recurrent brain injuries and second impact syndrome are highly preventable.
:(7) Many States have adopted concussion management rules and regulations, but many schools lack the resources to implement best practices in concussion diagnosis and management. 

=Sec. 3. Guidelines on best practices for diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injuries in school-aged children=

   Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act 6 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/243 42 U.S.C. 243 et seq.] )is amended by inserting after section 317T the following:
