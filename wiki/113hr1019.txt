				excessive, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory rates– ===



===={{anchor|H2D3CDA94DE5A49BA96E4FC88129EABFD}}(1) Authority of
				States– ====

Nothing in this
				section shall be construed to prohibit a State from imposing requirements
				(including requirements relating to rate review standards and procedures and
				information reporting) on health insurance issuers with respect to rates that
				are in addition to the requirements of this section and are more protective of
				consumers than such requirements.

===={{anchor|H5FCCADF26D724B15AE12E518400802C7}}(2) Consultation in
				rate review process– ====

In
				carrying out this section, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall consult with the National
				Association of Insurance Commissioners and consumer groups.

===={{anchor|HEF7FC88D0F054B1A9C3D5DBE2CCC30AB}}(3) Determination of
				who conducts reviews for each State– ====

The [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall determine, after the
				date of enactment of this section and periodically thereafter, the
				following:
:(A) In which markets in each State the State
				insurance commissioner or relevant State regulator shall undertake the
				corrective actions under
				paragraph (4), as a condition of the State
				receiving the grant in subsection (c), based on the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary’s]] determination
				that the State regulator is adequately undertaking and utilizing such actions
				in that market.
:(B) In which markets in each State the
				[[Wikipedia:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary]] shall undertake the corrective actions under
				paragraph (4), in cooperation with the
				relevant State insurance commissioner or State regulator, based on the
				[[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary’s]] determination that the State is not adequately undertaking and
				utilizing such actions in that market.

===={{anchor|HE9538AF40D514444A29EEA2145B3E4A5}}(4) Corrective
				action for excessive, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory
				rates– ====

In accordance with the
				process established under this section, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] or the relevant State
				insurance commissioner or State regulator shall take corrective actions to
				ensure that any excessive, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory rates are
				corrected prior to implementation, or as soon as possible thereafter, through
				mechanisms such as—
:(A) denying
				rates;
:(B) modifying rates; or
:(C) requiring rebates
				to consumers.

===={{anchor|HBA0F939E5CFC41919B8942BD79F2A0C0}}(5) Noncompliance– ====

Failure
				to comply with any corrective action taken by the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] under this
				subsection may result in the application of civil monetary penalties and, if
				the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines appropriate, make the plan involved ineligible for
				classification as a Qualified Health
				Plan..
