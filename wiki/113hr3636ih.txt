{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the excise tax on gasoline, diesel, and kerosene fuels.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Update, Promote, and Develop America’s Transportation Essentials Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings; sense of Congress=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Since the passage of SAFETEA–LU, Congress has transferred over $50 billion from the General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund, in order to maintain solvency.
:(2) The [[w:Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office]] estimates after the end of Fiscal year 2014, annual General Fund transfers of approximately $15 billion will be necessary in order to maintain current Highway Trust Fund spending levels.
:(3) The [[w:Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office]] also estimates that in order to provide funding for surface transportation projects where the Federal benefit outweighs the cost, an additional $83 billion a year would need to be allocated to the Highway and Transit Trust Funds.
:(4) The American Society for Civil Engineers estimates that in order to meet our economic and transportation needs, the United States should invest at least an additional $500 billion in our surface transportation system by 2020.
:(5) The National Commission on Fiscal Reform and Responsibility report, often referred to as the Simpson-Bowles plan, includes a recommendation to raise the gas tax by fifteen cents.
:(6) The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission recommended, in their 2009 report, that Congress take action to prevent the Highway Trust Fund from becoming insolvent, and to avoid any reductions in infrastructure spending. The Commission also noted that a Federal funding system based on a vehicle miles traveled system, is the consensus choice for the future.

==(b) Sense of Congress regarding replacement of gas tax– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that by 2024 the gas tax should be repealed and replaced with a more sustainable, stable funding source.
