{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of May as“National Bladder Cancer Awareness Month”.    Whereas 500,000 families in the United States live with bladder cancer;   Whereas more than 72,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with bladder cancer and 15,000 people are expected to die from the disease in 2013 alone;   Whereas bladder cancer affects people of all ages and backgrounds and is among the top 10 cancers with the highest incidence rates in the United States;   Whereas bladder cancer is known as one of the most expensive cancers to treat on a per patient basis with a recurrence rate of approximately 50 to 80 percent, requiring lifelong surveillance;   Whereas bladder cancer symptoms, such as blood in the urine, are easily recognized, however, many are unaware of the threat of bladder cancer, often prolonging time to diagnosis;   Whereas if diagnosed early, bladder cancer is treatable;   Whereas military veterans are twice as likely as non-veterans to be diagnosed with bladder cancer;   Whereas women are often diagnosed at a later stage in the development of bladder cancer, and when diagnosed at the same stage as men, women have a worse prognosis;   Whereas if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the life expectancy of an individual with bladder cancer decreases;   Whereas the quality of life of a person with bladder cancer will depend on future treatment and diagnosis developments, which will rely on research advancements;   Whereas there have been no new treatments developed for bladder cancer in more than 20 years;   Whereas research advancements for bladder cancer are limited by lack of awareness about the disease within the medical community and general public;   Whereas increased awareness will promote early diagnosis and increase chances of survival;   Whereas increased awareness will bolster public support of the disease and thus increase funding for innovative research and the development of new treatment options and diagnostic tools;   Whereas traditionally on the first Saturday in May, survivors, caregivers, and loved ones walk together throughout the United States to raise awareness of bladder cancer;   Whereas the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network and its community of patients, caregivers, and specialists, seek to foster a community of hope and support, fund and conduct research for innovative treatments and diagnostic tools, and increase public awareness and understanding of bladder cancer; and   Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as“National Bladder Cancer Awareness Month”: Now, therefore, be it
