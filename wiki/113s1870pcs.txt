======(j) Registration for modification– ======



=======(1) In general– =======

A tribunal may modify a child support order issued in another State which has been registered in the State of the tribunal if, after notice and hearing, the tribunal finds—
:(A) that—
::(i) no individual contestant or child resides in the State of the tribunal issuing the child support order;
::(ii) the individual contestant seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a child support order issued in another State does not reside in the State in which the registering tribunal is located; and
::(iii) the tribunal of the State in which the child support order has been registered has personal jurisdiction of the parties not seeking to modify, or modify and enforce, the child support order;
:(B) that the State in which the child support order has been registered—

A tribunal may not modify any term of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing State, including the duration of the obligation of support. If 2 or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the law of the State of the tribunal issuing the controlling order, as determined under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738B subsection (g)] , establishes the terms of the child support order which are not modifiable.

=======(3) Proceeding to modify– =======

In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the State of the tribunal that issued the initial controlling order, as determined under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738B subsection (g)] , governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor’s fulfillment of the duty of support established by that controlling order precludes a tribunal of another State from imposing a further obligation of child support on the obligor.

=======(4) Parties residing outside the United States– =======

Notwithstanding [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738B paragraph (1)] , a tribunal in the issuing State retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued in that State if—
:(A) 1 party resides in another State; and
:(B) the other party resides outside of the United States..
