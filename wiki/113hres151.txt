{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Recognizing the sesquicentennial of West Virginia statehood.Whereas 2013 marks 150 years since the United States admitted West Virginia as the 35th State in the Union;Whereas the sesquicentennial of West Virginia statehood is a truly momentous occasion that allows all West Virginians to reflect on the State’s proud heritage and bright future;Whereas the territory that is now the State of West Virginia was originally part of the Commonwealth of Virginia;Whereas, on May 23, 1861, Virginia voters ratified the Secession Ordinance to leave the United States and join the Confederacy;Whereas in June 1861, a group of pro-union Virginians met in Wheeling, West Virginia, in what became known as the Second Wheeling Convention;Whereas the Second Wheeling Convention declared all State offices in Virginia vacant, and all acts of the General Assembly to be null and void by virtue of its attempt to force“<nowiki>the people of Virginia to separate from and wage war against the government of the United States and against citizens of neighboring states[.]</nowiki>”;Whereas the Second Wheeling Convention created the Restored Government of Virginia that sought to rebuild ties with the Union;Whereas, on October 24, 1861, residents of the area that is now West Virginia voted to approve West Virginia statehood;Whereas President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation on April 20, 1863, during the heat of the Civil War, admitting West Virginia to the Union;Whereas West Virginia formally joined the Union on June 20, 1863; andWhereas President Lincoln recognized the importance of West Virginia’s admission to the Union by writing“<nowiki>[T]he admission of the new state, turns that much slave soil to free; and thus, is a certain, and irrevocable encroachment upon the cause of the rebellion. The division of a State is dreaded as a precedent. But a measure made expedient by a war, is no precedent for times of peace. It is said that the admission of West Virginia, is secession, and tolerated only because it is our secession. Well, if we call it by that name, there is still difference enough between secession against the constitution, and secession in favor of the constitution. I believe the admission of West Virginia into the Union is expedient.</nowiki>”: Now, therefore, be it
