[[w:Jim Moran|Mr. Moran]] (for himself and
[[w:Ander Crenshaw|Mr. Crenshaw]] ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a program to provide grants to nonprofit organizations to enable such organizations to assign and support volunteers to assist foreign countries in the administration of their natural resources in an environmentally sustainable manner.

=Section 1. Short Title=

This Act may be cited as the“International Conservation Corps Act of 2013”.

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) There is a significant deficit in the capability of many developing countries to manage their natural resources sustainably, which is fundamental to achieving economic development, poverty alleviation, conflict avoidance, good governance, and regional security.
:(2) Developing countries with a great wealth of natural resources are facing a great risk of conflict. Issues that arise in these countries include corruption, disputes over control and distribution of the resources and resulting wealth, fighting over and destruction of resources and resource-rich areas, and human rights abuses.
:(3) Developing countries that successfully manage their natural resource wealth, however, continue to benefit from these resources without resulting conflict.
:(4) It is in the security interest of the United States to share the vast experience and proven methodologies that the United States has achieved over many decades with developing countries struggling to establish their own successful natural resource management programs and policies.
:(5) The many United States senior professionals retiring from both the public and private sector with extensive experience and expertise in the field of natural resource management, acting in a voluntary capacity, presents a unique and important opportunity to help other countries develop the capacity to manage their natural resources sustainably.
