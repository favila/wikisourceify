={{anchor|id1038C938BC604DEC87FF9DC138F2EA1C}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Peace Corps Equity Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|id7e93fb58279540cc988a0e8769c9fb3f}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Women of the United States, particularly women serving the United States overseas, deserve a basic standard of care when it comes to their health.
:(2) Since its founding in 1961, the [[w:Peace Corps|Peace Corps]] has advanced interests of the United States by working to promote peace and friendship between the United States and the 139 nations in which the [[w:Peace Corps|Peace Corps]] has operated.
:(3) Over the past 50 years, more than 210,000 Peace Corps volunteers have served the United States by working in developing countries to address needs in areas such as education, health, youth and community development, business and information and communications technology, agriculture, and the environment.
:(4) More than 60 percent of the more than 8,000 current Peace Corps volunteers are women.
:(5) Peace Corps volunteers face inherent risks to their safety and security by virtue of living and working abroad.
:(6) Data from the [[w:Peace Corps|Peace Corps]] from 2000 to 2009 indicate that more than 1,000 Peace Corps volunteers experienced sexual assaults, including 221 rapes or attempted rapes. Data from the Peace Corps also show that incidents of sexual assault and rape against volunteers often go unreported.
:(7) Recognizing the high incidence of sexual assault in the [[w:Peace Corps|Peace Corps]] , [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] enacted the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011([[Public Law -|Public Law 112–57]] )to strengthen protections and support for sexual assault survivors.
:(8) Since fiscal year 1979, annual appropriations Acts have prohibited the Peace Corps from covering abortion services for its volunteers (including trainees), even in cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment of the woman. Employees of the [[w:Peace Corps|Peace Corps]] , on the other hand, are provided this coverage.
:(9) Abortion services in cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment of the woman are now available to almost all groups of women of the United States covered by Federal law, except Peace Corps volunteers.
:(10) Abortion coverage in cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment of the woman is available to most women, excluding Peace Corps volunteers, covered under Federal health plans, including employees covered by the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, servicewomen covered by TRICARE, Native Americans covered by the [[w:Indian Health Service|Indian Health Service]] , women inmates and immigration detainees, and Medicaid and Medicare recipients.
:(11) There is no rational basis for denying Peace Corps volunteers a basic health care benefit that is extended to other women covered under Federal health care plans.
