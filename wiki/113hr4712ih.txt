::(1) In selecting a location for the establishment of a new national cemetery under this chapter, the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]shall—
:::(A) give priority to a location in accordance with[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/2404 paragraph (2)]; and
:::(B) with respect to a location given such priority, ensure that the location is within 10 miles of the location that the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]determines likely to have a significant amount of the population to be served by such national cemetery during the 25-year period following such establishment.
::(2) 
:::(A) Except as provided by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/2404 subparagraph (C)], in selecting a location for the establishment of a new national cemetery under this chapter, the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]shall give priority to a State that does not have a national cemetery.
:::(B) In determining priority among more than one State described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/2404 subparagraph (A)], the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]shall give priority to the State that has the largest population of veterans.
:::(C) After any time that the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]establishes two national cemeteries in accordance with the priority described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/2404 subparagraph (A)], the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]may waive the requirements of such priority in establishing the national cemetery that immediately follows such two national cemeteries if the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]determines that such waiver will allow the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]to establish a national cemetery that will serve a larger population of veterans as compared to establishing a national cemetery in accordance with such priority.
