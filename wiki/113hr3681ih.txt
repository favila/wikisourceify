{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to promote health care technology innovation and access to medical devices and services for which patients choose to self-pay under the Medicare program, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Accelerating Innovation in Medicine Act of 2013” or the “AIM Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Innovation in health care technology is necessary to improve health outcomes and depends in part on the ability of medical technology developers, including scientists, physicians, engineers, and patient advocates, to introduce medical devices into the marketplace.
:(2) Even after meeting requirements for marketing set by the Food and Drug Administration, there may be uncertainties about patient access through government health care programs, causing significant delays in bringing innovative medical devices to patients or causing medical technology developers to abandon potential health care solutions.
:(3) Patients covered by the Medicare program are often willing to enter into self-pay arrangements with physicians and other providers to purchase items or services, yet under current laws restricting such freedom of choice, the self-pay arrangements may be associated with regulatory impediments or a risk of civil penalties.
:(4) Enabling health care technology manufacturers to designate products to be directly available to self-pay patients and excluded from government health program payments at an early stage of product development will promote innovation and result in increased patient access to desired products and services, save taxpayer dollars, and reduce administrative burdens on physicians and the government.
:(5) Enabling health care technology manufacturers to designate their devices as available to self-pay patients would permit a window of time during which additional data may be obtained on outcomes, comparative clinical effectiveness or other data elements for possible future coverage by the Medicare program.

=Sec. 3. Establishment of manufacturer opt-out program for medical devices=



==(a) In general– ==

 Section 1862 of the Social Security Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395y 42 U.S.C. 1395y] )is amended adding at the end the following new subsection:

====(1) In general– ====

Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall develop and maintain a listing (in this section referred to as the “AIM list” ) of medical devices for which, because of their inclusion in such listing, no insurance benefit and no payment may be made for such a device under this title either directly or on a capitated basis such that no claim for payment may be submitted under this title for such a device and an individual who consents to receive such a device is responsible for payment for the device and services related to furnishing the device.

====(2) Procedures for inclusion in AIM list– ====



=====(A) Requirement for written consent of manufacturer– =====

No medical device may be included in the AIM list without the written consent of the manufacturer of the device.

:(ii) the device is exempt from such approval and clearance requirements, the request may be submitted at a time that is not later than the first business day of the month beginning at least 30 days after the date of the first sale of the device by its manufacturer.

====(3) Listing periods; removal from list– ====



=====(A) 3-year listing periods– =====

A medical device included in the AIM list shall be initially listed for a period of 3 years and shall remain so listed for subsequent 3-year periods subject to subparagraphs (B)and (C).

=====(B) Removal at request of manufacturer– =====

At any time a device of a manufacturer included in the AIM list shall be removed from the AIM list upon the written request of the manufacturer. Subject to subparagraph (C), such a device of a manufacturer may not be removed from the AIM list except upon the written request of the manufacturer.

=====(C) Provision of data on clinical studies as a condition for continued listing– =====

As a condition for the continued inclusion of the device of a manufacturer in the AIM list for a subsequent 3-year listing period under subparagraph (A), the manufacturer shall provide the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] with published or publicly available data on clinical studies completed for the device at the end of the previous 3-year listing period. If the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines that a manufacturer of a device has materially failed to provide such data for the device, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may remove the device from the AIM list or not renew the listing for the device or both.
