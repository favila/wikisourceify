{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide a Federal charter to the Fab Foundation for the National Fab Lab Network, a national network of local digital fabrication facilities providing community access to advanced manufacturing tools for learning skills, developing inventions, creating businesses, and producing personalized products.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ National Fab Lab Network Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Scientific discoveries and technical innovations are critical to the economic and national security of the United States.
:(2) Maintaining the leadership of the United States in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will require a diverse population with the skills, interest, and access to tools required to advance these fields.
:(3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in communications and computation provided individuals with the Internet and personal computers, a digital revolution in fabrication will allow anyone to make almost anything, anywhere.
:(4) The Center for Bits and Atoms of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CBA) has contributed significantly to the advancement of these goals through its work in creating and advancing digital fab labs in the United States and abroad.
:(5) CBA’s fab labs provide a model for a new kind of national laboratory that links local facilities for advanced manufacturing to expand access and empower communities.
:(6) A coordinated national public-private partnership will be the most effective way to accelerate the provision of this infrastructure for learning skills, developing inventions, creating businesses, and producing personalized products. 

=Sec. 3. Establishment of national fab lab network=

In carrying out its functions, the [[w:|NFLN’s]] purposes and goals shall be—
:(1) to create a national network of connected local fab labs to empower individuals and communities in the United States;
:(2) to foster the use of distributed digital fabrication tools to promote science, technology, engineering and math skills, increase invention and innovation, create businesses and jobs, and fulfill needs; and
:(3) to seek to establish at least one fab lab per every 700,000 individuals in the United States in the first ten years of its operation, corresponding to availability in all 435 Congressional districts.

==(e) Definitions– ==

In this section, the term fab lab shall refer to a facility equipped with an integrated suite of fabrication tools to convert digital designs into functional physical things, and scanning tools to convert physical things into digital designs, as exemplified by CBA’s fab labs. These labs shall be available for a range of individual and collaborative educational, commercial, creative, and social purposes, with the [[w:|NFLN]] to provide guidelines for their sustainable operation.
