Whereas the United States and Indonesia are the world’s second and third largest democracies, respectively;   Whereas the United States and Indonesia share many common values, including respect for human rights and the rule of law;   Whereas in November 2010, the United States and Indonesia launched the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership, which solidified a long-term commitment to cooperation on key bilateral, regional and global issues;   Whereas the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership’s Democracy and Civil Society Working Group promotes enhanced cooperation on parliamentary and electoral processes and political empowerment for women;   Whereas Indonesia, a regional and global leader, has undergone a remarkable democratic transformation over the last 2 decades;   Whereas on July 9, 2014, approximately 135,000,000 votes were cast in Indonesia’s Presidential election, which was the largest single day election in the world to date;   Whereas on July 22, 2014, Joko Widodo was declared the winner in Indonesia’s Presidential election; and   Whereas Indonesia, with its vast geography, large multi-ethnic population, and largest Muslim majority population in the world, is a powerful model for a peaceful, democratic transition of power: Now, therefore, be it
