The [[w:Fannie Mae|Federal National Mortgage Association]] and the [[w:Freddie Mac|Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation]] shall each carry out a program under this section to provide for the refinancing of qualified mortgages on single-family housing owned by such enterprise through a refinancing mortgage, and for the purchase of and securitization of such refinancing mortgages, in accordance with this section and policies and procedures that the [[w:Federal Housing Finance Agency|Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency]] shall establish.

The property that is subject to the mortgage shall be the same property that is subject to the qualified mortgage being refinanced.

===(3) Interest rate– ===

The mortgage shall bear interest at a single rate that is fixed for the entire term of the mortgage, which shall be equivalent to the premium received by the enterprise on the qualified mortgage being refinanced plus the cost of selling a newly issued mortgage having comparable risk and term to maturity in a mortgage-backed security, as such rate may be increased to the extent necessary to cover, over the term to maturity of the mortgage, any fee paid to the servicer pursuant to subsection (d) , the cost of any title insurance coverage issued in connection with the mortgage, and, as determined by the [[w:Federal Housing Finance Agency|Director]] , a portion of any administrative costs of the program under this section as may be attributable to the mortgage.

===(5) Term to maturity– ===

The mortgage shall have a term to maturity of not more than 40 years from the date of the beginning of the amortization of the mortgage.

===(6) Prohibition on borrower fees– ===

The servicer conducting the refinancing shall not charge the mortgagor any fee for the refinancing of the qualified mortgage through the refinancing mortgage.

===(7) Title insurance– ===

The fee for title insurance coverage issued in connection with the mortgage shall be reasonable in comparison with fees for such coverage available in the market for mortgages having similar terms.

==(d) Fee to servicer– ==

The [[w:Federal Housing Finance Agency|Director]] may, in the Director’s sole discretion, require each enterprise to pay to the servicer of a qualified mortgage a fee, in such amount as the [[w:Federal Housing Finance Agency|Director]] considers appropriate, for each qualified mortgage of an enterprise that the servicer refinances through a refinancing mortgage pursuant to this section.

==(f) Termination– ==
