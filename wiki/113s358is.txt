{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Master Teacher Corps program.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “STEM Master Teacher Corps Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Numerous recent reports by national advisory groups, including the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] and National Academies' committees, have highlighted the need to raise student achievement in STEM fields to enable the United States to maintain its competitive edge in the global economy.
:(2) Success in the American workforce increasingly requires science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills.
:(3) According to the [[w:Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor Statistics]] , there will be 6,750,000 STEM-related job openings by 2020, as defined by the Occupational Information Network.
:(4) Recent standardized tests show United States students’ mathematics and science performance is only average or below average compared with their international peers. According to the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, 60 percent of U.S. eighth graders failed to meet the intermediate international benchmark in mathematics and 27 percent failed to reach the same benchmark in science.
:(5) Too few American students graduate from high school with the interest and the preparation to successfully pursue STEM degrees in college. Well over half of college students in China and Japan major in STEM fields, compared with only a third of U.S. students.
:(6) Several researchers, including at Stanford University, have found that the effects of well-prepared teachers on student achievement can be stronger than the influences of student background factors, such as poverty, language background, and minority status.
:(7) The Harvard Graduate School of Education report “Who Stays in Teaching and Why” cites research that shows more young people would consider teaching if it offered more opportunities for advancement, and that if schools fail to offer teachers these opportunities throughout their teaching careers, they may risk losing them permanently. It also reports that well implemented mentoring and induction programs provide the support novices need to feel satisfied and remain in their schools.
:(8) Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have found that STEM teachers migrate within the teaching profession to better paying jobs at better-funded schools, resulting in local imbalances and leaving schools in high-poverty communities struggling to find knowledgeable teachers.
:(9) Individuals with strong STEM skills have opportunities for more lucrative careers outside of teaching. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States ranks in the bottom third of OECD countries in terms of teacher salary relative to other occupations requiring tertiary education. Furthermore, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers show the average salary offered to recent college graduates in 2012 in certain STEM-related fields was up to $20,000 higher than that offered to new secondary school teachers and up to $23,000 higher than that offered to new elementary school and middle school teachers.
