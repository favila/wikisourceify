{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of cancer care planning and coordination under the Medicare program.

=Section 1. Short title=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the “Planning Actively for Cancer Treatment (PACT) Act of 2013” .

==(b) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Individuals with cancer often do not have access to a cancer care system that incorporates shared decision-making and the coordination of all elements of care.
:(2) The cancer care system has not traditionally offered individuals with cancer a shared decision-making process, a prospective and comprehensive plan for treatment, symptom management and supportive care, strategies for updating and evaluating such plan with the assistance of a health care professional, and a follow-up plan for monitoring and treating possible late effects of cancer and its treatment.
:(3) Cancer survivors often experience the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of the symptoms of cancer, a problem that begins at the time of diagnosis and may become more severe with disease progression and at the end of life. The failure to treat the symptoms, side effects, and late effects of cancer and cancer treatment may have a serious adverse impact on the health, survival, well-being, and quality of life of cancer survivors.
:(4) The 1999 Institute of Medicine report entitled The Unequal Burden of Cancer found that low-income people often lack access to adequate cancer care and that ethnic minorities have not benefitted fully from cancer treatment advances.
:(5) Individuals with cancer often do not participate in a shared decision-making process that considers all treatment options and do not benefit from coordination of all elements of active treatment and palliative care.
:(6) Quality cancer care should incorporate access to psychosocial services and management of the symptoms of cancer and the symptoms of cancer treatment, including pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and depression.
:(7) Quality cancer care should include a means for engaging cancer survivors in a shared decision-making process that produces a comprehensive care summary and a plan for follow-up care after primary treatment to ensure that cancer survivors have access to follow-up monitoring and treatment of possible late effects of cancer and cancer treatment, including appropriate psychosocial services.
:(8) The Institute of Medicine report entitled Ensuring Quality Cancer Care described the elements of quality care for an individual with cancer to include—
::(A) the development of initial treatment recommendations by an experienced health care provider;
::(B) the development of a plan for the course of treatment of the individual and communication of the plan to the individual;
::(C) access to the resources necessary to implement the course of treatment;
::(D) access to high-quality clinical trials;
::(E) a mechanism to coordinate services for the treatment of the individual; and
::(F) psychosocial support services and compassionate care for the individual.
:(9) In its report From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition , the Institute of Medicine recommended that individuals with cancer completing primary treatment be provided a comprehensive summary of their care along with a follow-up survivorship plan of treatment.
:(10) In Cancer Care for the Whole Patient , the Institute of Medicine stated that the development of a plan that includes biomedical and psychosocial care should be a standard for quality cancer care in any quality measurement system.
:(11) Because more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, cancer care inadequacies should be addressed through the Medicare program.
:(12) Shortcomings in providing cancer care, resulting in a lack of shared decision-making, inadequate management of cancer symptoms, and insufficient monitoring and treatment of late effects of cancer and its treatment, relate in part to the inadequacy of Medicare payments for such planning and coordination services.
:(13) Changes in Medicare payment for cancer care planning and coordination will support shared decision-making that reviews all treatment options and will contribute to improved care for individuals with cancer from the time of diagnosis through the end of the life.

Such standards shall include standards for determining the need and frequency for revisions of the treatment plans and follow-up survivorship care plans based on changes in the condition of the individual or elements and intent of treatment and standards for the communication of the plan to the individual.
:(3) In this subsection, the term shared decision-making process means, with respect to an individual, a process in which the individual and the individual’s health care providers consider the individual’s diagnosis, treatment options, the medical evidence related to treatment options, the risks and benefits of all treatment options, and the individual’s preferences regarding treatment, and then jointly develop and implement a treatment plan..
