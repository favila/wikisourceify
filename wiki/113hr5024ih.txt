{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title II of the Social Security Act to credit prospectively individuals serving as caregivers of dependent relatives with deemed wages for up to five years of such service.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Social Security Caregiver Credit Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds that:
:(1) Caregiving is an essential element of family life and a vital service for children, the ill, the disabled, and the elderly.
:(2) The establishment of a caregiver credit would bolster the economic prospects of unpaid caregivers and would provide them with vital retirement security.
:(3) The 2013 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds concluded that the combined Trust Funds will be able to pay scheduled benefits in full until 2033.
:(4) While there is no immediate crisis, policy options should be considered to extend OASDI solvency, including by eradicating the gender wage gap, increasing overall employment, or increasing the minimum wage. 

=Sec. 3. Deemed wages for caregivers of dependent relatives=

  Title II of theSocial Security Actis amended by adding after  section 234 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/434 42 U.S.C. 434] )the following new section:

<blockquote>

:(2) The term dependent relative means, in connection with an individual—
::(A) a child, grandchild, niece, or nephew (of such individual or such individual’s spouse or domestic partner) who is under the age of 12, or
::(B) a child, grandchild, niece, or nephew (of such individual or such individual’s spouse or domestic partner), a parent, aunt, or uncle (of such individual or his or her spouse or domestic partner), or such individual’s spouse or domestic partner, if such child, grandchild, niece, nephew, parent, aunt, uncle, spouse, or domestic partner is a chronically dependent individual.

::(B) In any case in which there are more than 60 qualifying months for an individual, only the last 60 of such months shall be taken into account for purposes of this section.
:(2)   Paragraph (1) shall not be applicable in the case of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment if a larger such benefit or payment, as the case may be, would be payable without its application.

==(c) Identification Requirements– ==
