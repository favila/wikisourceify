=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The individual right to keep and bear arms protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution includes the right to acquire firearms and ammunition without undue burdens.
:(2) Jurisdictions have imposed taxes or fees on the acquisition of firearms and ammunition that inhibit the exercise of the Second Amendment, particularly among individuals of limited means.
:(3) Local taxation of firearms and ammunition suppresses lawful interstate commerce that is vital to a robust Second Amendment to the Constitution.
:(4) The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has the authority to regulate interstate commerce in firearms and ammunition to ensure that States are not suppressing access to these lawful products.
:(5) The singling out of firearms and ammunition for special taxation as a means to suppress their acquisition is an infringement of the Second Amendment and disproportionately affects those in low income communities whose need for self-defense may be especially acute.
