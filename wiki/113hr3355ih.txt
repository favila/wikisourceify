=Sec. 3. Findings; sense of the Congress=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Data indicate that manufacturing employees earn a higher average salary and receive greater benefits than workers in other industries.
:(2) Recent data also show that United States manufacturing companies cannot fill as many as 600,000 skilled positions, even as unemployment numbers hover at historically high levels.
:(3) Postsecondary success and workforce readiness can be achieved through attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials.
:(4) Data indicate that United States manufacturers invest a far greater percentage of revenue in research and development than other industries.
:(5) The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world.
:(6) A recent report indicates that United States manufacturers face a 20 percent structural cost burden compared to companies from the Nation’s 9 largest trading partners.
:(7) Excessive Federal regulations are placing a heavy burden on United States manufacturers.
:(8) According to a recent report, it is estimated that pending and recently finalized Environmental Protection Agency regulations alone could cost manufacturers over $100,000,000,000 per year in compliance, plus additional one-time costs of over $500,000,000.
:(9) Data indicate that regulatory costs could cut annual United States economic output by as much as $630,000,000,000, or 4.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product, resulting in a net loss of 9,000,000 jobs.
:(10) Expanded domestic resource development would further reduce energy costs, increasing United States manufacturers’ competitive advantage.
:(11) Data show that United States manufacturers have reduced energy usage and emissions to below the 1990 levels.
:(12) Reports indicate United States health care costs have increased over 80 percent in the past decade, creating greater personnel costs for manufacturers.
:(13) Data show that United States manufacturers are responsible for 47 percent of total United States exports.
:(14) A widening trade gap with major trade partners means that manufacturers are at risk of losing export market share.

==(b) Sense of the Congress– ==

It is the sense of the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that increasing the competitiveness of United States manufacturers will strengthen the national economy.
