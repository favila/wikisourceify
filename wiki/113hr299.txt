      Findings
      The 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             finds the following:
			
        (1)
        There is no
			 reason, either historically or by virtue of law, why the people of the District
			 of Columbia, the capital of the United States of America, should not have full
			 voting representation in the 
                [[United States Congress|Congress of the United States]]
            .
			
      
        (2)
        Article I, section
			 8, clause 17 of the Constitution of the United States, which authorized the
			 creation of the District of Columbia, provides only that the Congress shall
			 have exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over that
			 District.
			
      
        (3)
        The same clause of
			 the Constitution provides that 
                [[United States Congress|Congress ]]
            
          shall exercise like authority
			 over other Federal territories that have been purchased from the States
			 for Federal purposes. Residents of other Federal enclaves, though also denied
			 voting rights after becoming subject to exclusive Federal jurisdiction, have
			 had restored their right to vote for and serve as elected Federal officials
			 from their respective States which ceded the Federal enclaves to the United
			 States.
			
      
        (4)
        
          
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             has
			 exercised its authority to regulate Federal elections under article I, section
			 4 of the Constitution to set the legal requirements that States must follow in
			 establishing Congressional districts. 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             has also exercised this
			 authority to require States to allow United States citizens who are former
			 residents, and their children who are United States citizens, who are living
			 overseas to vote in Federal elections in the previous State of residence,
			 notwithstanding the fact that such former residents and their children may have
			 no intention of returning or establishing residence in that State, and
			 notwithstanding the fact that such citizens are not subject to the laws of that
			 State, including tax laws.
			
      
        (5)
        The entire
			 territory of the current District of Columbia was ceded to the United States by
			 the State of Maryland, one of the original 13 States of the United States. The
			 portion of the original District of Columbia ceded to the United States by the
			 Commonwealth of Virginia was returned to the authority of that state in 1846,
			 and the people who now reside in that area vote as citizens of the Commonwealth
			 of Virginia.
			
      
        (6)
        The 
                [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court
			 of the United States]]
             has found that the cession of legislative authority over
			 the territory that became the District of Columbia by the States of Maryland
			 and Virginia did not remove that territory from the United States, and that the
			 people who live in that territory are entitled to all the rights, guarantees,
			 and immunities of the Constitution that they formerly enjoyed as citizens of
			 those States. O’Donoghue v. United States, 289 U.S. 516 (1933); Downes v.
			 Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901). Among those guarantees are the right to equal
			 protection of the laws and the right to participate, equally with other
			 Americans, in a Republican form of government.
			
      
        (7)
        Since the people
			 who lived in the territory that now makes up the District of Columbia once
			 voted in Maryland as citizens of Maryland, and Congress by adoption of the
			 Organic Act of 1801 severed the political connection between Maryland and the
			 District of Columbia by statute, Congress has the power by statute to restore
			 Maryland state citizenship rights, including Federal electoral rights, that it
			 took away by enacting the Organic Act of 1801.
