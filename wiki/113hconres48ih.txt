{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Commemorating the 46th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.    Whereas for 3,000 years Jerusalem has been the focal point of Jewish religious devotion;   Whereas there has been a continuous Jewish presence in Jerusalem for three millennia and a Jewish majority in the city since the 1840s;   Whereas the once thriving Jewish majority of the historic Old City of Jerusalem was driven out by force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War;   Whereas from 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city, and Israeli citizens of all faiths, as well as Jewish citizens of all states, were denied access to holy sites in the area controlled by Jordan;   Whereas in 1967, Jerusalem was reunited by Israel during the conflict known as the Six Day War;   Whereas since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city, and persons of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full access to holy sites within the city;   Whereas this year marks the 46th year that Jerusalem has been administered as a unified city, in which the rights of all faiths have been respected and protected;   Whereas each sovereign country, under international law and custom, has the right to designate its own capital;   Whereas this year marks the 65th anniversary of Israel’s independence;   Whereas Jerusalem is the seat of the Government of Israel, including the President, Parliament, and the Supreme Court;   Whereas the United States maintains its embassy in the functioning capital of every country except in the case of Israel, a friend and strategic ally of the United States;   Whereas the  Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 ([[Public Law 104-45|Public Law 104–45]] ), which became law on November 8, 1995, states as a matter of United States policy that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel; and   Whereas the  Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 ( [[Public Law 107-228|Public Law 107–228]]  )directs that the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]]shall, upon the request of a citizen or a citizen’s legal guardian, record the place of birth of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem as Israel: Now, therefore, be it
