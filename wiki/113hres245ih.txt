{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 24th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, calling for the release of Dr. Wang Bingzhang, and for other reasons.    Whereas the freedoms of expression, assembly, and association are fundamental human rights and are recognized as such under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;   Whereas the protests in Tiananmen Square were the result of the peaceful democratic movement throughout China and were calling for open dialogue with the Government of the People’s Republic of China and its leaders regarding democratic reform;   Whereas the People’s Liberation Army and other security forces used lethal force to disperse demonstrations in Beijing on June 3, 1989, and June 4, 1989;   Whereas the People’s Liberation Army and other security forces wounded and killed thousands of innocent people;   Whereas thousands of people throughout China who were suspected of taking part in the democracy movement were arrested and sentenced without trial;   Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China has become increasingly sophisticated in its persecution of religious groups, human rights and democracy advocates, and ethnic minorities;   Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China kidnapped Dr. Wang Bingzhang, a United States permanent resident and one of the founders of the Chinese democracy movement, and sentenced him to life in prison on charges of espionage and terrorism in a closed trial, and whose detention was declared arbitrary by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention;   Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China continues to— 
:(1) take active measures to deny citizens information regarding the Tiananmen Square massacre, and continues to suppress access to information about the event on the Internet; 
:(2) harass, detain, or imprison members of the Chinese democracy movement and other advocates for democratic reform, human rights, and religious freedom; 
:(3) oppress and persecute the peaceful, spiritual movement of Falun Gong and its leaders and practitioners; and 
:(4) restrict and censor free speech on the Internet; and   Whereas June 4, 2013, is the 24th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre: Now, therefore, be it
