=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the United States has a history of catastrophic natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, flood, fire, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions;
:(2) although catastrophic natural disasters occur infrequently, they will continue to occur and are predictable;
:(3) such disasters generate large economic losses and a major component of those losses comes from damage and destruction to homes;
:(4) for the majority of Americans, their investment in their home represents their single biggest asset and the protection of that investment is paramount to economic and social stability;
:(5) historically, when a natural disaster eclipses the ability of the private industry and a State to manage the loss, the Federal Government has stepped in to provide the funding and services needed for recovery;
:(6) the cost of such Federal bail-outs are borne by all taxpayers equally, as there is no provision to repay the money and resources provided, which thereby unfairly burdens citizens who live in lower risk communities;
:(7) as the risk of catastrophic losses grows, so do the risks that any premiums collected by private insurers for extending coverage will be insufficient to cover future catastrophes (known as timing risk), and private insurers, in an effort to protect their shareholders and policyholders (in the case of mutually owned companies), have thus significantly raised premiums and curtailed insurance coverage in States exposed to major catastrophes;
:(8) such effects on the insurance industry have been harmful to economic activity in States exposed to major catastrophes and have placed significant burdens on existing residents of such States;
:(9) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma struck the United States in 2005, causing over $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses, and insured losses to homeowners in excess of $50,000,000,000;
:(10) since 2004, the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has appropriated more than $58,000,000,000 in disaster relief to the States affected by natural catastrophes;
:(11) the Federal Government has provided and will continue to provide resources to pay for losses from future catastrophes;
:(12) when Federal assistance is provided to the States, accountability for Federal funds disbursed is paramount;
:(13) the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] or other appropriate agencies must have the means in place to confirm that Federal funds for catastrophe relief have reached the appropriate victims and have contributed to the recovery effort as efficiently as possible so that taxpayer funds are not wasted and citizens are enabled to rebuild and resume productive activities as quickly as possible;
:(14) States that are recipients of Federal funds must be responsible to account for and provide an efficient means for distribution of funds to homeowners to enable the rapid rebuilding of local economies after a catastrophic event without unduly burdening taxpayers who live in areas seldom affected by natural disasters;
:(15) State insurance and reinsurance programs can provide a mechanism for States to exercise that responsibility if they appropriately underwrite and price risk, and if they pay claims quickly and within established contractual terms; and
:(16) State insurers and reinsurers, if appropriately backstopped themselves, can absorb catastrophic risk borne by private insurers without bearing timing risk, and thus enable all insurers (whether State-operated or privately owned) to underwrite and price insurance without timing risk and in such a way to encourage property owners to pay for the appropriate insurance to protect themselves and to take steps to mitigate against the risks of disaster by locally appropriate methods.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are to establish a program to provide a Federal backstop for State-sponsored insurance programs to help homeowners prepare for and recover from the damages caused by natural catastrophes, to encourage mitigation and prevention for such catastrophes, to promote the use of private market capital as a means to insure against such catastrophes, to expedite the payment of claims and better assist in the financial recovery from such catastrophes.

=Sec. 3. Qualified reinsurance programs=



==(a) In general– ==

For purposes of this Act only, a program shall be considered to be a qualified reinsurance program if the program—
:(1) is authorized by State law for the purposes described in this section;
:(2) is an entity in which the authorizing State maintains a material, financial interest;
:(3) provides reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to underlying primary insurers or reinsurers for losses arising from all personal residential lines of insurance, as defined in the Uniform Property & Casualty Product Coding Matrix published and maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners;
:(4) has a governing body, a majority of whose members are public officials;
:(5) provides reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to underlying primary insurers or reinsurers for losses in excess of such amount that the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] has determined represents a catastrophic event in that particular State;
:(6) is authorized by a State that has in effect such laws, regulations, or other requirements, as the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] shall by regulation provide, that—
::(A) ensure, to the extent that reinsurance coverage made available under the qualified reinsurance program results in any cost savings in providing insurance coverage for risks in such State, such cost savings are reflected in premium rates charged to consumers for such coverage;
::(B) require that any new construction, substantial rehabilitation, and renovation insured or reinsured by the program complies with applicable State or local government building, fire, and safety codes;
::(C) require State authorized insurance entities within that State to establish an insurance rate structure that takes into account measures to mitigate insurance losses;
::(D) require State authorized insurance and reinsurance entities within that State to establish rates at a level that annually produces expected premiums that shall be sufficient to pay the expected annualized cost of all claims, loss adjustment expenses, and all administrative costs of reinsurance coverage offered; and
::(E) encourage State authorized insurance and reinsurance entities within that State to establish rates that do not involve cross-subsidization between any separate property and casualty lines covered under the State authorized insurance or reinsurance entity; and
:(7) complies with such additional organizational, underwriting, and financial requirements as the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] shall, by regulation, provide to carry out the purposes of this Act.
