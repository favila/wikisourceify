====={{anchor|HE860DFFEA6D84302AF11D1C1B2B96384}}(I) In general– =====

In determining any estimate under clause (i), with respect to the following calendar year, of the projected volume of cellulosic biofuel production (as described in paragraph (7)(D)(i)), the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Administrator of the Energy Information Administration]] shall—
:(aa) for each cellulosic biofuel production facility that is producing (and continues to produce) cellulosic biofuel during the period of January 1 through October 31 of the calendar year in which the estimate is made (in this clause referred to as the“current calendar year”)—
::(AA) determine the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by such facility, based on the actual volume produced by such facility during such period; and
::(BB) based on such average monthly volume of production, determine the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for such facility for the current calendar year; and
:(bb) for each cellulosic biofuel production facility that begins initial production of (and continues to produce) cellulosic biofuel after January 1 of the current calendar year—
::(AA) determine the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by such facility, based on the actual volume produced by such facility during the period beginning on the date of initial production of cellulosic biofuel by the facility and ending on October 31 of the current calendar year; and
::(BB) based on such average monthly volume of production, determine the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for such facility for the current calendar year.

An estimate under clause (i)with respect to the following calendar year of the projected volume of cellulosic biofuel production (as described in paragraph (7)(D)(i)), shall be equal to the total of the estimated annual volumes of cellulosic biofuel production for all cellulosic biofuel production facilities described in subclause (I)for the current calendar year..
