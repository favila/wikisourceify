={{anchor|ID649da25bff804a8d9221dc73c2f5ebee}}Sec. 3. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Nearly 11,000,000 children under age 5 are in some type of child care setting every week.
:(2) Numerous reports have found that child care is hard to find in many communities throughout the United States.
:(3) A 2010 study by the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] found children who received high-quality care in the first few years of life scored higher on measures of academic and cognitive achievement when the children were 15 years old, and were less likely to misbehave, than children enrolled in low-quality care in those years.
:(4) More than 1,000,000 families a year receive assistance in finding child care through a national child care referral line and website, with nearly half the calls to the referral line coming from military families, including those who are faced with deployment.
:(5) The national child care referral line had 57,000,000 page views by parents looking for child care in their community as well as parents looking for information about selecting a child care provider.
:(6) Over 200,000 publications were mailed to parents last year, in both English and Spanish, by the operator of the national referral line and website, to provide consumer education to parents looking for child care.
