=Sec. 3. Separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures=



==(a) In General– ==

   Subtitle B of title IV of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17081 42 U.S.C. 17081 et seq].)is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 

==Sec. 424. Separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures==



===(a) Definitions– ===

In this section:

====(1) High-performance energy efficiency measure– ====

The term high-performance energy efficiency measure means a technology, product, or practice that will result in substantial operational cost savings by reducing energy consumption and utility costs.

====(2) Separate spaces– ====

The term separate spaces means areas within a commercial building that are leased or otherwise occupied by a tenant or other occupant for a period of time pursuant to the terms of a written agreement.

===(b) Study– ===



====(1) In general– ====

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]], acting through the [[w:|Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]], shall complete a study on the feasibility of—
:(A) significantly improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction, by owners and tenants, of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures; and
:(B) encouraging owners and tenants to implement high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces.

====(2) Scope– ====

The study shall, at a minimum, include—
:(A) descriptions of—
::(i) high-performance energy efficiency measures that should be considered as part of the initial design and construction of separate spaces;
::(ii) processes that owners, tenants, architects, and engineers may replicate when designing and constructing separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures;
::(iii) policies and best practices to achieve reductions in energy intensities for lighting, plug loads, heating, cooling, cooking, laundry, and other systems to satisfy the needs of the commercial building tenant;
::(iv) return on investment and payback analyses of the incremental cost and projected energy savings of the proposed set of high-performance energy efficiency measures, including consideration of available incentives;
::(v) models and simulation methods that predict the quantity of energy used by separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures and that compare that predicted quantity to the quantity of energy used by separate spaces without high-performance energy efficiency measures but that otherwise comply with applicable building code requirements;
::(vi) measurement and verification platforms demonstrating actual energy use of high-performance energy efficiency measures installed in separate spaces, and whether such measures generate the savings intended in the initial design and construction of the separate spaces;
::(vii) best practices that encourage an integrated approach to designing and constructing separate spaces to perform at optimum energy efficiency in conjunction with the central systems of a commercial building; and
::(viii) any impact on employment resulting from the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures; and
:(B) case studies reporting economic and energy savings returns in the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures.

====(3) Public participation– ====

Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comments regarding effective methods, measures, and practices for the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures.

====(4) Publication– ====

The Secretary shall publish the study on the website of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. .

=Sec. 4. Tenant star program=



==(a) In General– ==

   Subtitle B of title IV of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17081 42 U.S.C. 17081 et seq].)(as amended by section 3 ) is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>
