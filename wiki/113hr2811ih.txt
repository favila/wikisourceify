Making supplemental appropriations for the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Research First Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) In fiscal year 2013, the budget of the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]] was decreased by approximately $1.55 billion pursuant to section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/901a 2 U.S.C. 901a] ).
:(2) The [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]] is the true [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for the citizens of the United States, conducting vital research to fight the enemy of disease and protect the infrastructure of the human body. Such research funding should not be slashed while the Pentagon budget continues to increase.
:(3) The national security interests of the United States can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as suggested by the Department of Defense’s January 2012 strategic guidance titled “Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense” .
:(4) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] has found that there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear facilities of the [[w:National Nuclear Security Administration|National Nuclear Security Administration of the Department of Energy]] . Significant savings can also be found by reducing expenditures on weapons which the military has not requested such as the Abrams Tank, bringing military and infrastructure operations in Afghanistan to a close, and decreasing the Nation’s reliance on expensive, private contractors.
