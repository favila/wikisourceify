				insurance option
						
              (a)

				and administration of a public health insurance option
							
                (1)
                Establishment
                For
				years beginning with 2014, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]]
             (in this
				subtitle referred to as the Secretary) shall provide for the
				offering through Exchanges established under this title of a health benefits
				plan (in this Act referred to as the public health insurance
				option) that ensures choice, competition, and stability of affordable,
				high-quality coverage throughout the United States in accordance with this
				section. In designing the option, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
            ’s primary responsibility is to
				create a low-cost plan without compromising quality or access to care.
							
              
                (2)
                Offering through
				Exchanges
								
                  (A)
                  Exclusive to
				Exchanges
                  The public health insurance option shall only be made
				available through Exchanges established under this title.
								
                
                  (B)
                  Ensuring a level
				playing field
                  Consistent with
				this section, the public health insurance option shall comply with requirements
				that are applicable under this title to health benefits plans offered through
				such Exchanges, including requirements related to benefits, benefit levels,
				provider networks, notices, consumer protections, and cost sharing.
								
                
                  (C)
                  Provision of
				benefit levels
                  The public health insurance option—
									
                    (i)
                    shall offer bronze, silver, and gold plans;
				and
									
                  
                    (ii)
                    may offer
				platinum plans.

                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             may
				enter into contracts for the purpose of performing administrative functions
				(including functions described in subsection (a)(4) of section 1874A of the
				Social Security Act) with respect to the public health insurance option in the
				same manner as the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             may enter into contracts under subsection (a)(1)
				of such section. The 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             has the same authority with respect to the
				public health insurance option as the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             has under subsections (a)(1)
				and (b) of section 1874A of the Social Security Act with respect to title XVIII
				of such Act. Contracts under this subsection shall not involve the transfer of
				insurance risk to such entity.
							
              
                (4)

                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             shall establish an office of
				the ombudsman for the public health insurance option which shall have duties
				with respect to the public health insurance option similar to the duties of the
				Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman under section 1808(c)(2) of the Social Security
				Act. In addition, such office shall work with States to ensure that information
				and notice is provided that the public health insurance option is one of the
				health plans available through an Exchange.
							
              
                (5)
                Data
				collection
                The 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
            
				shall collect such data as may be required to establish premiums and payment
				rates for the public health insurance option and for other purposes under this
				section, including to improve quality and to reduce racial, ethnic, and other
				disparities in health and health care.
							
              
                (6)
                Access to
				Federal courts
                The provisions of Medicare (and related provisions
				of title II of the Social Security Act) relating to access of Medicare
				beneficiaries to Federal courts for the enforcement of rights under Medicare,
				including with respect to amounts in controversy, shall apply to the public
				health insurance option and individuals enrolled under such option under this
				title in the same manner as such provisions apply to Medicare and Medicare
				beneficiaries.

                    (ii)

				sufficient to fully finance the costs of—
										
                      (I)
                      health benefits
				provided by the public health insurance option; and

             shall continue to use an administrative
				process to set such rates in order to promote payment accuracy, to ensure

				excessive or deficient, taking into account the provisions of subsection (a)(1)

				shall the correction of payments under this paragraph result in a level of
				expenditures per enrollee that exceeds the level of expenditures that would
				have occurred under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A), as certified by the 
                [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Office of

				in this section shall be construed as affecting the authority of the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
            
				to establish payment rates, including payments to provide for the more
				efficient delivery of services, such as the initiatives provided for under

				beginning with 2014, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             may utilize innovative payment mechanisms
				and policies to determine payments for items and services under the public
				health insurance option. The payment mechanisms and policies under this
				subsection may include patient-centered medical home and other care management
				payments, accountable care organizations, value-based purchasing, bundling of
				services, differential payment rates, performance or utilization based
				payments, partial capitation, and direct contracting with providers. Payment
				rates under such payment mechanisms and policies shall not be set at levels
				expected to increase average medical costs per enrollee covered under the
				public health insurance option beyond what would be expected if the process
				under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A) of subsection (c) were continued, as
				certified by the 
                [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare &

                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             shall design and implement the payment mechanisms and policies under
				this subsection in a manner that—
								
                  (A)
                  seeks to—
									
                    (i)
                    improve health
				outcomes;

                    reduce health
				disparities (including racial, ethnic, and other disparities);
									
                  
                    (iii)
                    provide
				efficient and affordable care;
									
                  
                    (iv)
                    address
				geographic variation in the provision of health services; or
									
                  
                    (v)
                    prevent or manage
				chronic illness; and

                (3)
                Encouraging the
				use of high value services
                To the extent allowed by the benefit
				standards applied to all health benefits plans participating under the Exchange
				involved, the public health insurance option may modify cost sharing and
				payment rates to encourage the use of services that promote health and
				value.
							
              
                (4)
                Non-uniformity
				permitted
                Nothing in this
				subtitle shall prevent the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]

				payment structure models (such as accountable care organizations and medical
				homes) under the public health insurance option for different geographic
				areas.

				provider to participate in the public health insurance option unless such
				provider is appropriately licensed or certified under State law.
