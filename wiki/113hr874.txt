={{anchor|H8992E57392D9437689827C9E91291E7B}}Section 1. Short title=

={{anchor|HF4364BD615E04CBC997577143709ED7C}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Alice Paul was born on January, 11, 1885, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, and died on July 9, 1977.
:(2) Alice Paul dedicated her life to securing suffrage and equal rights for all women and, as founder of the World Woman’s Party, she was instrumental in the passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
:(3) Alice Paul and the National Woman’s Party were the first group ever to picket the White House.
:(4) While President Woodrow Wilson trumpeted America’s values of democracy abroad during World War I, Alice Paul was dedicated to reminding the President that not all Americans enjoyed democracy at home.
:(5) Alice Paul used nonviolent civil disobedience to bring national attention to the women’s suffrage movement, such as the 3-week hunger strike she undertook when she was sentenced to jail in October, 1917, for her demonstrations.
:(6) Alice Paul’s courage inspired thousands of women to join the women’s suffrage movement.
:(7) Instead of patiently waiting for States to grant women suffrage, Alice Paul mobilized an entire generation of women to pressure the United States Congress and the President to give all women in America the right to vote.
:(8) Alice Paul did not stop her fight after the 19th Amendment was ratified; she drafted the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1923 and fought tirelessly for its passage until her death 54 years later.
:(9) Alice Paul lobbied [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to include gender in civil rights bills and was successful in including sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

:(12) Few people have played a greater role in shaping the history of the United States than Alice Paul.
