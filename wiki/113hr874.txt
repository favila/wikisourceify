			 Congressional Gold Medal Act

        
.

{{section|HF4364BD615E04CBC997577143709ED7C|2. Findings}}
The [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
(1)
Alice Paul was born on January, 11, 1885,
			 in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, and died on July 9, 1977.

(2)
Alice Paul
			 dedicated her life to securing suffrage and equal rights for all women and, as
			 founder of the World Woman’s Party, she was instrumental in the passage of the
			 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution.

(3)
Alice Paul and the
			 National Woman’s Party were the first group ever to picket the White
			 House.

(4)
While President
			 Woodrow Wilson trumpeted America’s values of democracy abroad during World War
			 I, Alice Paul was dedicated to reminding the President that not all Americans
			 enjoyed democracy at home.

(5)
Alice Paul used
			 nonviolent civil disobedience to bring national attention to the women’s
			 suffrage movement, such as the 3-week hunger strike she undertook when she was
			 sentenced to jail in October, 1917, for her demonstrations.

(6)
Alice Paul’s
			 courage inspired thousands of women to join the women’s suffrage
			 movement.

(7)
Instead of
			 patiently waiting for States to grant women suffrage, Alice Paul mobilized an
			 entire generation of women to pressure the United States Congress and the
			 President to give all women in America the right to vote.

(8)
Alice Paul did not
			 stop her fight after the 19th Amendment was ratified; she drafted the Equal
			 Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1923 and fought
			 tirelessly for its passage until her death 54 years later.

(9)
Alice Paul lobbied
			 [[United States Congress|Congress]] to include gender in civil rights bills and was successful in
			 including sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
			 1964
.

(10)
Alice Paul sought
			 equal rights for women all over the world, not just Americans and, as a means
			 of pursuing this goal, founded the World Party for Equal Rights for Women in
			 the 1930s.

(11)
Alice Paul was
			 instrumental in the placement of a passage on gender equality in the preamble
			 of the United Nations Charter.

(12)
Few people have played a greater role in
			 shaping the history of the United States than Alice Paul.

(13)
Alice Paul is an
			 example to all Americans of what one person can do to make a difference for
			 millions of people.
