{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Supporting women’s reproductive health.Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care is critical to improving the health and well-being of women and their families;Whereas access to affordable contraceptives and medically accurate information prevents unintended pregnancies, thereby improving the health of women, children, families, and society as a whole;Whereas title X of the Public Health Service Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300 42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.] )and the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] )cover health care and family planning services for millions of women and men who do not have other insurance coverage, with the Medicaid program alone covering 71 percent of publicly funded family planning services and more than 40 percent of all births in the United States;Whereas women need access to comprehensive, affordable insurance that covers family planning services, prenatal and postnatal care, miscarriage management, labor and delivery services, and abortion; andWhereas the lack of adequate prenatal care increases the risks of infant and maternal mortality and preterm birth, which cost our health care system approximately $26,000,000,000 annually: Now, therefore, be it
