{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the year of 2014 as the“International Year of Family Farming”.    Whereas United Nations Resolution A/Res/66/222, adopted by the [[w:United Nations|General Assembly]]on December 22, 2011, designates the year 2014 as the“International Year of Family Farming”;   Whereas the International Year of Family Farming recognizes the important contribution of family farming in food security and eradicating poverty around the world;   Whereas in the United States, family farms constitute 96 percent of all farms;   Whereas the agriculture sector contributes more than $130,000,000,000 to the United States economy, employs approximately 14 percent of the total workforce in the United States, and accounts for nearly 5 percent of the United States gross domestic product;   Whereas 45 percent of individuals around the world make a living directly by farming;   Whereas family farming is the predominant form of agriculture in both developing and developed countries;   Whereas family farming serves as a means of organizing agricultural, forestry, fishery, pastoral, and aquaculture production;   Whereas family farming plays important socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural roles;   Whereas family farmers grow high-quality food, are active participants in civil society, and are stewards of the land;   Whereas 75 percent of the poorest individuals around the world live in rural areas;   Whereas family farms are linked to most areas of rural development and have invested significantly in local communities;   Whereas the majority of farmers around the world are women who produce up to 80 percent of food around the world; and   Whereas 870,000,000 individuals are suffering from chronic undernourishment and a disproportionate number of such individuals are farmers: Now, therefore, be it
