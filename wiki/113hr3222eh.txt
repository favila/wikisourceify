 To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of sites associated with the 1657 signing of the Flushing Remonstrance in Queens, New York, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Flushing Remonstrance Study Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) Dutch involvement in North America started with Henry Hudson’s 1609 voyage on the ship, Half Moon, employed by the Dutch East India Company.
:(2) After 1640, New Netherland gradually began to transform from a chain of trading posts into a settlement colony.
:(3) As Dutch and English settlers moved closer to one another, they began to assimilate in what would later become Queens County.
:(4) The Dutch and English settlements had not been without conflict. Although the Dutch Republic was well known for its toleration of other faiths, Director General Peter Stuyvesant and his council thought that liberty of worship should not be granted to Quakers.
:(5) When Quakers began to arrive in Flushing, the colonial government issued an ordinance that formally banned the practice of all religions outside of the Dutch Reformed Church.
:(6) On December 27, 1657, 30 Flushing residents signed what was later called the Flushing Remonstrance, objecting to this order. None of the remonstrance’s authors were Quakers.
:(7) Dutch colonial authorities proceeded to arrest the signers of the Flushing Remonstrance. In 1662, John Bowne defied the ban and allowed Quakers to hold services in his house. Bowne was fined and banished to the Dutch Republic for showing contempt for secular authority.
:(8) Bowne was later exonerated after appealing to the guarantees of religious liberty before the Dutch West India Company and returned to Flushing in 1664. The colony later fell to British control on September 24, 1664.
:(9) The Flushing Remonstrance is now considered by many to be instrumental in the development of religious liberty in the United States and a precursor to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
:(10) In 1957, the [[w:United States Postal Service|United States Postal Service]]released a 3-cent postage stamp commemorating the 300th Anniversary of the signing of the Flushing Remonstrance which read, Religious Freedom in America .
:(11) Queens remained rural and agricultural through the 18th and 19th Centuries. Although its Dutch identity diminished, the tolerance of diversity that has harbored Quakers and other religious sects in the Dutch Colonial period continues to this day. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world, with a population of over 2,200,000 representing over 100 different nations and speaking over 138 different languages.
