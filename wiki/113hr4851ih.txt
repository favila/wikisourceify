{{Center|A BILL}}

 To promote access for United States officials, journalists, and other citizens to Tibetan areas of the People’s Republic of China, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The Chinese Government does not grant United States officials, journalists, and other citizens access to the People’s Republic of China on a reciprocal basis to the access the United States Government grants Chinese officials, journalists, and citizens.
:(2) The Chinese Government imposes greater restrictions on travel to Tibetan areas than to other areas of the People’s Republic of China.
:(3) Officials of the People’s Republic of China have stated that Tibet is open to foreign visitors.
:(4) The Chinese Government is promoting tourism in Tibetan areas, and has announced plans to make tourism a“pillar industry”for the region.
:(5) The Chinese Government requires foreigners to obtain permission from the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office or from the Tibet Tourism Bureau to enter the Tibet Autonomous Region, a restriction that is not imposed on travel to any other provincial-level jurisdiction in the People’s Republic of China.
:(6) The [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]reports that the Tibet Foreign and Overseas Affairs Office denied more than 10 requests for United States diplomatic access to the Tibet Autonomous Region between May 2011 and December 2012, and that when such requests are granted, diplomatic personnel are closely supervised and given few opportunities to meet local residents not approved by authorities.
:(7) The Chinese Government restricted United States consular access after an October 28, 2013, bus crash in the Tibet Autonomous Region, in which at least two Americans died and more than a dozen others, all from Walnut, California, were injured.
:(8) The Chinese Government has failed to respond positively to the United States Government’s request to open a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region.
:(9) The [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]reports that the Chinese government regularly denies requests by American diplomats, foreign journalists, and observers to visit Tibetan areas, and that those permitted to visit are subject to“highly structured, government-organized tours”that limit independent, objective reporting.
:(10) The [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]reports that foreign diplomats who were permitted to travel in Tibetan areas outside the Tibet Autonomous Region were“repeatedly approached by local police and sometimes forced to leave without reasonable explanation”.
:(11) The [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]reports that permission is not always granted to foreign tourists, and that when granted, Lhasa, Rikaze (Shigatse), and Shannan (Lhoka) are usually the only places in the Tibet Autonomous Region open to foreigners.
:(12) Foreign visitors also face restrictions in their ability to travel freely in Tibetan areas outside the Tibet Autonomous Region.
:(13) Foreign visitors to Tibetan areas are explicitly limited to tours that are tightly managed by authorities.
:(14) Restrictions on journalists’ access to Tibetan areas conflict with government regulations, adopted in 2008, lifting requirements that foreign journalists get permission of local authorities to travel in the country and interview Chinese citizens.
:(15) The United States Government generally allows journalists and other citizens of the People’s Republic of China to travel freely within the United States. The United States Government requires Chinese diplomats to notify the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]of their travel plans, and in certain situations, the United States Government requires Chinese diplomats to obtain approval from the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]before travel. However, where approval is required, it is almost always granted expeditiously.
:(16) The United States regularly grants visas to Chinese officials, scholars, and others who travel to the United States to discuss, promote and display the Chinese Government’s perspective on the situation in Tibetan areas, even as the Chinese Government restricts the ability of United States citizens to travel to Tibetan areas to gain their own perspective.
:(17) Chinese diplomats based in the United States generally avail themselves of the freedom to travel to United States cities and lobby city councils, mayors, and governors to refrain from passing resolutions, issuing proclamations, or making statements of concern on Tibet.
:(18) The Chinese Government characterizes statements made by United States officials about the situation in Tibetan areas as inappropriate interference in the internal affairs of China.
