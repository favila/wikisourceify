==Title VII— Policy Provisions==



==Sec. 701. Asteroid Retrieval Mission==



===(a) In General– ===

Consistent with the policy stated in section 201(b) , the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]may not fund the development of an asteroid retrieval mission to send a robotic spacecraft to a near-Earth asteroid for rendezvous, retrieval, and redirection of that asteroid to lunar orbit for exploration by astronauts.

===(b) Asteroid survey– ===

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]may not pursue a program to search for asteroids of 20 meters or less in diameter unless the survey program described in section 322(c) is at least 90 percent complete.

===(c) Report– ===

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall provide to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]]a report on the proposed Asteroid Retrieval Mission. Such report shall include—
:(1) a detailed budget profile, including cost estimates for the development of all necessary technologies and spacecraft required for the mission;
:(2) a detailed technical plan that includes milestones and a specific schedule;
:(3) a description of the technologies and capabilities anticipated to be gained from the proposed mission that will enable future human missions to Mars which could not be gained by lunar missions;
:(4) a description of the technologies and capabilities anticipated to be gained from the proposed mission that will enable future planetary defense missions, against impact threats from near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter, which could not be gained by current or planned missions; and

==Sec. 702. Termination liability==



===(a) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) The International Space Station, the Space Launch System, and the Orion crew capsule will enable the Nation to continue operations in low-Earth orbit and to send its astronauts to deep space. The James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionize our understanding of star and planet formation and how galaxies evolved and advance the search for the origins of our universe. As a result of their unique capabilities and their critical contribution to the future of space exploration, these systems have been designated by Congress and the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]as priority investments.
:(2) While the Space Launch System and the Orion programs, currently under development, have made significant progress, they have not been funded at levels authorized, and as a result congressionally authorized milestones will be delayed by several years.
:(3) Although the James Webb Space Telescope is making steady progress towards its scheduled 2018 launch, it confronts a number of challenging integration tests that will stress a congressionally imposed development cost cap.
:(4) In addition, contractors are currently holding program funding, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, to cover the potential termination liability should the Government choose to terminate a program for convenience. As a result, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are unavailable for meaningful work on these programs.
:(5) According to the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]], the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]procures most of its goods and services through contracts, and it terminates very few of them. In fiscal year 2010, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]terminated 28 of 16,343 active contracts and orders—a termination rate of about 0.17 percent.
:(6) Providing processes requiring congressional action on termination of these high-priority programs would enable contractors to apply taxpayer dollars to making maximum progress in meeting the established technical goals and schedule milestones of these programs.

===(b) NASA termination liability– ===



====(1) General rule– ====

Termination liability costs for a covered program shall be provided only pursuant to this subsection.

====(2) Prohibition on reserving funds– ====

====(3) Intent of Congress– ====

It is the intent of Congress that funds authorized to be appropriated for covered programs be applied in meeting established technical goals and schedule milestones.

====(4) Application of prior reserved funds– ====

Funds that have been reserved before the date of enactment of this Act for potential termination liability shall be promptly used to make maximum progress in meeting the established goals and milestones of the covered program.

====(5) Notification– ====

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall notify the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]]not later than 120 days in advance of initiating termination for convenience or termination for cause of a prime contract on a covered program.

=====(B) Intent of Congress– =====

It is the intent of Congress to provide additional authorization for appropriations as may be necessary to pay termination liability costs on prime contracts for covered programs if Congress deems it appropriate that the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]terminate such prime contracts. The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]shall be responsible for applying these additional funds for payment of all allowable and reasonable negotiated termination liability costs if the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]terminates a prime contract for a covered program. If the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]]terminates a prime contract for a covered program for the convenience of the Federal Government, then the Federal Government is responsible for payment of all allowable and reasonable negotiated termination liability costs on the prime contract.

===(c) Reporting– ===

Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the prime contracts on covered programs, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]]shall transmit to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]]a report that provides—
