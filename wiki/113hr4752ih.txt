{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to limit the authority of the Federal Communications Commission over providers of broadband Internet access service.   

=Section 1. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The Internet is a powerful engine for economic growth that has remained open, free, and accessible without government regulation since its entrance into the public sphere.
:(2)   Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 was designed for the monopoly telephone system in 1934 and has its origins in 19th century shipping regulations.
:(3) Imposing the obligations and requirements of title II of such Act on broadband Internet access service would severely harm broadband investment and create myriad negative unintended consequences.
:(4) The [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]]has consistently taken actions that classify broadband Internet access service, even in different forms, as an information service. Such actions include the following:
::(A) In 1998, Chairman Bill Kennard issued a Report to Congress finding that Internet access is an information service with a telecommunications component.
::(B) In 2002, the Commission issued a Declaratory Ruling (17 FCC Rcd 4798) classifying cable modem broadband Internet access service as an information service. In the 2005 case of National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services (545 U.S. 967), the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed this determination that such service is not a common carrier service and is appropriately classified as an information service.
::(C) In 2005, the Commission issued a Report and Order (20 FCC Rcd 14853) affirming the classification of wireline broadband Internet access service as an information service.
::(D) In 2007, the Commission issued a Declaratory Ruling (22 FCC Rcd 5901) affirming the classification of wireless broadband Internet access service as an information service.
:(5) These Commission rulings unleashed tens of billions of dollars of investment in the Nation’s broadband networks, investment that would not have been made if broadband services were subject to common carrier requirements.
