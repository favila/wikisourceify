		Expressing the sense of Congress that a
		  carbon tax is not in the economic interest of the United
		  States.
	
	
		
      Whereas a carbon tax is regressive in nature and would
			 unfairly burden those vulnerable individuals and families in the United States
			 that are already struggling under a stagnating economy;
		
    
      Whereas a carbon tax would increase the cost of every good
			 manufactured in the United States;
		
    
      Whereas a carbon tax would harm the entire United States
			 manufacturing sector;
		
    
      Whereas the increase in production of domestic energy
			 resources on private and State-owned land has created significant job growth
			 and private capital investment; and
		
    
      Whereas affordable and reliable energy sources are
			 critical to maintaining the United States global competitiveness: Now,
			 therefore, be it
