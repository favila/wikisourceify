The enterprises shall include as eligible borrowers in the [[w:|Home Affordable Refinance Program]]all current borrowers who have an eligible mortgage and meet those underwriting requirements for eligibility for same servicer refinancing in the [[w:|Program]]as of January 1, 2013, except that the enterprises may not disqualify or impose varying rules within the Program for borrowers based on LTV, CLTV, employment status or income.

The enterprises shall not require of any qualified lender executing a loan under the [[w:|Program]]any representations or warranties—
