To provide for a comprehensive assessment of the
		  scientific and technical research on the implications of the use of mid-level
		  ethanol blends, and for other purposes.

In this Act:

=={{anchor|H8FE7DCF21E9242EDB760C68BD2772309}}(1) Administrator– ==

The
			 term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the Environmental
			 Protection Agency.

=={{anchor|HBEE78C01F56C4E0798416BB60B071DB5}}(2) Mid-level
			 ethanol blend– ==

The term “mid-level ethanol blend”
			 means an ethanol-gasoline blend containing greater than 10 and up to and
			 including 20 percent ethanol by volume that is intended to be used in any
			 conventional gasoline-powered motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle or
			 engine.

=={{anchor|H77D7F4F6FC1845EEB630724510E30688}}(a) In
			 general– ==

The Administrator, acting through the Assistant
			 Administrator of the Office of Research and Development at the Environmental
			 Protection Agency, shall—
:(1) not later than 45
			 days after the date of enactment of this Act, enter into an agreement with the
			 National Academy of Sciences to provide, within 18 months after the date of
			 enactment of this Act, a comprehensive assessment of the scientific and
			 technical research on the implications of the use of mid-level ethanol blends,
			 comparing mid-level ethanol blends to gasoline blends containing 10 percent or
			 zero percent ethanol; and
:(2) not later than 30
			 days after receiving the results of the assessment under paragraph (1), submit
			 a report to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of
			 Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate
			 on the findings of the assessment, together with the agreement or disagreement
			 of the Administrator with each of its findings.

=={{anchor|HD49D722886034D1D8A097A2F7DD3768F}}(b) Waivers– ==

Prior to the submission of the report under
			 subsection (a)(2), any waiver granted under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air
			 Act (42 U.S.C. 7545 (f)(4)) before the date of enactment of this Act that
			 allows the introduction into commerce of mid-level ethanol blends for use in
			 motor vehicles shall have no force or effect. The Administrator shall grant no
			 new waivers under such section 211(f)(4) until after the submission of the
			 report described under subsection (a)(2).

=={{anchor|H75001269911F411D8AF3F534A25B531D}}(c) Contents– ==

The
			 assessment performed under subsection (a)(1) shall include the
			 following:
:(1) An evaluation of
			 the short-term and long-term environmental, safety, durability, and performance
			 effects of the introduction of mid-level ethanol blends on onroad, nonroad, and
			 marine engines, onroad and nonroad vehicles, and related equipment. Such
			 evaluation shall consider the impacts of qualifying mid-level ethanol blends or
			 blends with higher ethanol concentrations as a certification fuel. Such
			 evaluation shall include a review of all available scientific evidence,
			 including all relevant government and industry data and testing, including that
			 relied upon by the Administrator and published at 75 Fed. Reg. 68094 et seq.
			 (November 4, 2010), 76 Fed. Reg. 4662 et seq. (January 26, 2011), and 76 Fed.
			 Reg. 44406 et seq. (July 25, 2011), and identify gaps in understanding and
			 research needs related to—
::(A) tailpipe
			 emissions;
::(B) evaporative
			 emissions;
::(C) engine and fuel
			 system durability;
::(D) onboard
			 diagnostics;
::(E) emissions
			 inventory and other modeling effects;
::(F) materials
			 compatibility;
::(G) operability and
			 drivability;
::(H) fuel
			 efficiency;
::(I) fuel
			 economy;
::(J) consumer education
			 and satisfaction;
::(K) cost-effectiveness
			 for the consumer;
::(L) catalyst
			 durability; and
::(M) durability of
			 storage tanks, piping, and dispensers for retail.
:(2) An identification
			 of areas of research, development, and testing necessary to—
::(A) ensure that
			 existing motor fuel infrastructure is not adversely impacted by mid-level
			 ethanol blends, including an examination of potential impacts of mid-level
			 ethanol blends on metal, plastic, rubber, or any other materials used in pipes
			 or storage tanks; and
::(B) reduce the risk of
			 misfueling by users at various points in the distribution and supply chain,
			 including at bulk storage, retail storage, and distribution configurations
			 by—
:::(i) assessing the best
			 methods and practices to prevent misfueling;
:::(ii) examining
			 misfueling mitigation strategies for blender pumps, including volumetric
			 purchase requirements and labeling requirements;
:::(iii) assessing the
			 adequacy of and ability for misfueling mitigation plans approved by the
			 Environmental Protection Agency; and
:::(iv) examining the
			 technical standards and recommendations of the National Institute of Standards
			 and Technology, the American National Standards Institute, and the
			 International Organization for Standardization regarding fuel pump
			 labeling.

			 appropriations=

In order to
			 carry out this Act, the Administrator shall utilize up to $900,000 from the
			 funds made available for science and technology, including research and
			 development activities, at the Environmental Protection Agency.
