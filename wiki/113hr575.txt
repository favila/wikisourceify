1. Short title

2. Sense of the Congress


=(a) Findings=

The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds that—: it is the constitutional power of [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]to determine United States foreign policy through the ratification of international treaties and adoption of laws;: by prematurely signing treaties and executive agreements, [[Wikipedia:Executive Office of the President|Presidents of the United States ]]have opened the door for international organizations to unilaterally regulate the lives of citizens of the United States;: these international agreements, laws, and regulations are being applied domestically in the United States through the Supremacy Clause, which states, “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding ”;: the Supremacy Clause is useful to supersede conflicting Federal and State laws;: international and transnational organizations force their rules on people of the United States through conventions, multilateral agreements, and nonratified treaties, such as agreements that affect the private ownership of firearms by law-abiding citizens; and: United States sovereignty is risked by domestic legal applicability of international treaties and executive agreements that have not been voted on and congressionally adopted through formal processes which pose a threat to national sovereignty and the liberty of the people of the United States, including fundamental rights guaranteed under the United States Constitution, such as the right to keep and bear arms.
