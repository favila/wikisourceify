To award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. R. Adams Cowley, in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the advancement of trauma care.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Dr. R. Adams Cowley Congressional Gold Medal Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Dr. Cowley was a pioneer in the practice of open-heart surgery, trauma mitigation and emergency medical services. His goal through vigorous research into the impacts of trauma was to reduce the instances of death due to shock and was awarded a $100,000 contract from the Army to study the effects of shock in soldiers.
:(2) Dr. Cowley established the first clinical shock trauma unit in the Nation in 1960. Dr. Cowley’s realization of the importance of the first 60 minutes of treatment after critical injury led to an idea called the “Golden Hour Theory” .
:(3) Dr. Cowley’s advocacy of the Golden Hour theory led to the first medevac transport system in 1969 after the opening of the new 5-story, 32-bed Center for the Study of Trauma in Baltimore, Maryland.
:(4) Dr. Cowley’s work continued to produce new advances in shock trauma treatment. In 1979, former Maryland Governor Marvin Mandel issued an Executive order establishing the Center for the Study of Trauma at the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medicine and Dr. Cowley was appointed Director of the Division of Emergency Medical Services.
:(5) Dr. Cowley was a tireless advocate for the Shock Trauma Center throughout his entire career testifying before Maryland legislators and fighting for funding for equipment, helicopters and anything else he needed to build the EMS System in Maryland.
:(6) Dr. Cowley’s hard work laid the foundation for emergency medicine to become a discipline of its own. Hundreds of medical personnel have trained at the Shock Trauma Center including members of the United States Military in preparation for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq.
