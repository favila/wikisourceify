{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Designating the week of May 1 through May 7, 2013, as “National Physical Education and Sport Week” .Whereas a decline in physical activity has contributed to the unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity, which has more than tripled in the United States since 1980;Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to the continued health and well-being of children;Whereas according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] , overweight adolescents have a 70- to 80-percent chance of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for chronic disease, disability, and death;Whereas physical activity reduces the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and certain types of cancers;Whereas type 2 diabetes can no longer be referred to as “late in life” or “adult onset” diabetes because type 2 diabetes presently occurs in children as young as 10 years old;Whereas the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans issued by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] recommend that children engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the week;Whereas according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] , only 19 percent of high school students are meeting the goal of 60 minutes of physical activity each day;Whereas children spend many of their waking hours at school and, as a result, need to be active during the school day to meet the recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans;Whereas nationally, according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] , 1 out of 4 children does not attend any school physical education classes, and fewer than 1 in 4 children get 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day;Whereas teaching children about physical education and sports not only ensures that the children are physically active during the school day, but also educates the children on how to be physically active and the importance of physical activity;Whereas according to a 2006 survey by the Department of Health and Human Services, 3.8 percent of elementary schools, 7.9 percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high schools provide daily physical education (or an equivalent) for the entire school year, and 22 percent of schools do not require students to take any physical education courses at all;Whereas according to that 2006 survey, 13.7 percent of elementary schools, 15.2 percent of middle schools, and 3.0 percent of high schools provide physical education (or an equivalent) at least 3 days per week for the entire school year for students in all grades in the school;Whereas research shows that fit and active children are more likely to thrive academically;Whereas increased time in physical education classes can help the attention, concentration, and achievement test scores of children;Whereas participation in sports teams and physical activity clubs, often organized by the school and run outside of the regular school day, can improve grade point average, school attachment, educational aspirations, and the likelihood of graduation;Whereas participation in sports and physical activity improves self-esteem and body image in children and adults;Whereas children and youths who partake in physical activity and sports programs have increased motor skills, healthy lifestyles, social skills, a sense of fair play, strong teamwork skills, self-discipline, and avoidance of risky behaviors;Whereas the social and environmental factors affecting children are in the control of the adults and the communities in which the children live, and therefore, the people of the United States share a collective responsibility in reversing the childhood obesity epidemic;Whereas if efforts are made to intervene with unfit children to bring those children to physically fit levels, then there may also be a concomitant rise in the academic performance of those children; andWhereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] strongly supports efforts to increase physical activity and participation of children and youth in sports: Now, therefore, be it
