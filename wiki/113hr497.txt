This Act may be cited as the
			 “America Works
			 Act”.

={{anchor|H5DC5826AA8C74F419AA01F8C1341B112}}Sec. 2. Findings=

[[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Recent data show
			 that United States manufacturing companies cannot fill as many as 600,000
			 skilled positions, even as unemployment numbers hover at historically high
			 levels.
:(2) The unfilled
			 positions are mainly in the skilled production category, and in occupations
			 such as machinist, operator, craft worker, distributor, or technician.
:(3) In less than 20
			 years, an overall loss of expertise and management skill is expected to result
			 from the gradual departure from the workplace of 77,200,000 workers.
:(4) Postsecondary
			 success and workforce readiness can be achieved through attainment of a
			 recognized postsecondary credential.
:(5) The Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational
			 Outlook estimates that 746,500 new jobs in computer-related occupations will be
			 generated from 2010 to 2020. This would equate to a 23 percent net growth in
			 computer-related occupations.
:(6) Computer-related
			 occupations with the highest projected growth rates include database
			 administrators, software developers, and network and computer systems
			 administrators.
:(7) As of June 2012,
			 there were approximately 301,214 job openings in the information technology
			 sector.
:(8) According to a
			 recent report, 64 percent of managers hiring for information technology jobs
			 rate certifications as having extremely high or high value in validating
			 information technology skills and expertise, and that value is rated highest by
			 senior managers, such as chief information officers, and by medium-size
			 firms.
