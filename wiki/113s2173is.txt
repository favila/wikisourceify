 To amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to provide a permanent path for the direct enrollment of individuals in qualified health plans.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Consumers Having Options in Choosing Enrollment Act   ”or the“  CHOICE Act  ”. 

=Sec. 2. Permanent Pathway for Direct Enrollment=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Successful implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (referred to in this section as the“  ACA  ”) is critical to ensuring that more Americans are able to access health care coverage.
:(2) The ACA provided for the establishment of new State-based or, in the absence of State action, federally facilitated marketplaces to help connect consumers with health insurance options and coverage.
:(3) As part of the regulatory guidance related to the marketplaces, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]provided consumers with an option to enroll in health insurance coverage directly, known as direct enrollment.
:(4) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]also permits enrollment through an Exchange with the assistance of an agent or broker, including permitting consumers to select a product on the Internet website of an agent or broker.
:(5) Consumers should be permitted a permanent option to enroll directly with a qualified health plan issuer, or Internet website of an agent or broker, in a manner consistent with the marketplaces and as long as certain consumer protections are followed.
:(6) Consumers should continue to be informed that other health insurance products are available and offered.
:(7) Consumers should be notified of their eligibility determination for coverage through the Exchange Internet website for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions.
:(8) Direct enrollment is not a new idea and has proven to work successfully in getting seniors coverage through the Medicare Advantage program and the Medicare Part D program.
:(9) Providing a permanent pathway for consumers to directly enroll with a qualified health plan issuer or the certified Internet website of an agent or broker gives such consumers another option to sign up for health insurance coverage and takes the United States one step closer to achieving the goals of the ACA .
