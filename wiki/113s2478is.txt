[[w:|Ms. Collins]](for herself and
[[w:|Mrs. Murray]]) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]] }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To authorize the Secretary of Transportation to partner with industry to strengthen the safety culture and safety practices of short line and regional freight railroads.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Short Line Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) The use of new oil recovery techniques, particularly in regions without a sufficient number of developed pipeline networks, has led to rapid growth in the transportation of crude oil by rail.
:(2) Recent accidents in North America involving trains carrying crude oil, such as the July 2013 tragedy in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, have brought the need for enhanced safety into focus.
:(3) Short line and regional railroads have workforces and resources that are much smaller than large Class I railroads, but these railroads are expected to handle the same commodities safely.
:(4) Cooperative safety reviews, assessments, and training approaches can enhance safety by fostering an enhanced safety culture. Cooperation between industry and the [[w:Federal Railroad Administration|Federal Railroad Administration]]’s Research and Development Program would enhance rail safety with respect to the transportation of crude oil by rail and in all other areas of rail transportation.
