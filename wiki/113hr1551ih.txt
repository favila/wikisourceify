This Act may be cited as the“Consumer Rental Purchase Agreement Act”.

=Sec. 2. Findings and declaration of purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) The rental-purchase industry provides a service that meets and satisfies the demands of many consumers.
:(2) Each year, approximately 2,300,000 United States households enter into rental-purchase transactions and over a 5-year period approximately 4,900,000 United States households will do so.
:(3) Competition among the various firms engaged in the extension of rental-purchase transactions would be strengthened by informed use of rental-purchase transactions.
:(4) The informed use of rental-purchase transactions results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this title is to assure the availability of rental-purchase transactions and to assure simple, meaningful, and consistent disclosure of rental-purchase terms so that consumers will be able to more readily compare the available rental-purchase terms and avoid uninformed use of rental-purchase transactions, and to protect consumers against unfair rental-purchase practices.
