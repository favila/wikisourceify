{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for the goals and ideals of“National Donate Life Month”.    Whereas in March 2014, over 118,800 individuals were on the official waiting list for organ donation managed by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network;   Whereas in 2013, 31,422 organs from 14,257 donors (including both living and deceased donors) were transplanted into 28,952 patients, yet 6,123 candidates for transplantation died while waiting for an organ transplant;   Whereas on average, 18 people die every day of every year while waiting for an organ donation;   Whereas over 100,000,000 people in the United States are registered to be organ and tissue donors, yet the demand for donated organs still outweighs the supply of organs made available each day;   Whereas many people do not know about their options for organ and tissue donation, or have not made their wishes clear to their families;   Whereas organ and tissue donation can give meaning to the tragic loss of a loved one by enabling up to 8 people to receive the gift of life from a single deceased donor;   Whereas living donors can donate a kidney or a portion of a lung or liver to save the life of another individual; and   Whereas April is traditionally recognized as“National Donate Life Month”: Now, therefore, be it
