2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:
: A single, open, global Internet is a vital tool for facilitating the free and secure flow of information and products without regard to distances or national boundaries.: The goal of a single, open, global Internet is best supported by policies that—:: encourage utilization on a global basis of technology standards set by international standards-setting organizations, including industry-led and other voluntary bodies, and selected by the market;:: respect the security of information, privacy, and speech of Internet users;:: promote investment in Internet-related innovation;:: refrain from compelling Internet service providers and other intermediaries to restrict the free flow of information on the Internet; and:: allow trade in Internet-related goods, services, information, and content.: Certain governments and international bodies are adopting or considering policies contrary to the goal of a free, open Internet, including—:: mandating unique technology standards favoring domestic producers as a condition of market access or pursuing related policies regarding standard-setting that are discriminatory and subvert the open, global nature of the Internet;:: sponsoring or tolerating the use of Internet-related tools to gain unauthorized access to public-sector and private-sector networks in the United States to disrupt their operation;:: blocking, filtering, or otherwise restricting Internet communications in a manner that discriminates against Internet-based services and content originating in other countries;:: monitoring Internet use and communications in a manner that restricts individual privacy and freedom; and:: imposing market access requirements or liabilities that discriminate against or otherwise impede Internet-related goods, services and content from other countries.: Such actions threaten the interests of the United States by—:: facilitating attempts by foreign governments to restrict or disrupt the free flow of information on the Internet;:: promoting “national Internets ”in conflict with the underlying rationale and architecture of the Internet as originally envisioned and constructed, thereby compromising the Internet’s full functionality and promise;:: harming United States workers and businesses, undermining a strong United States industrial base, and putting foreign competitors at an advantage; and:: putting at risk the utility of the Internet as a tool of open communication, assembly, and commerce, and the individuals who seek to use it for such purposes.
