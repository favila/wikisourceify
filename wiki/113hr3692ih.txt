{{Center|
[[w:David Loebsack|Mr. Loebsack]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To authorize a competitive grant program to implement and evaluate digital learning in rural locales.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Schools of the Future Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Digital learning technology holds the promise of transforming rural education by removing barriers of distance and increasing school capacity.
:(2) While many large urban local educational agencies are at the forefront of implementing new digital learning innovations, it is often harder for smaller and more rural local educational agencies to access these tools. Smaller local educational agencies with less capacity may also find it more difficult to provide the training needed to effectively implement new digital learning technologies.
:(3) Despite the potential of digital learning in rural areas, these advancements risk bypassing rural areas without support for their implementation. Rather than having schools and local educational agencies apply digital learning innovations designed for urban environments to rural areas, it is important that digital learning technologies be developed and implemented in ways that reflect the unique needs of rural areas.
:(4) Digital learning is rapidly expanding, and new tools for improving teaching and learning are being developed every day. A growing demand for digital learning tools and products has made rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness increasingly important, as this information would allow school and local educational agency leaders to make informed choices about how best to use these tools to improve student achievement and educational outcomes.
:(5) High-quality digital learning increases student access to courses that may not have been available to students in rural communities, increasing their college and career readiness.
