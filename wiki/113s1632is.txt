 To protect 10th Amendment rights by providing special standing for State government officials to challenge proposed regulations, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Restoring the 10th Amendment Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds:
:(1) The 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (referred to in this Act as the 10th Amendment ), ratified on December 15, 1791, provides,“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”.
:(2) The 10th Amendment expressly limits the powers of the Federal Government to those delegated by the Constitution and reaffirms and protects the freedom of the States to exercise those that are not.
:(3) The 10th Amendment reflects the opposition of the Founding Fathers to a Federal Government with expansive powers, their intention for the powers of the States to act as a check on those of the Federal Government, and their concern that the Federal Government would attempt to usurp powers intended to remain with the States.
:(4) James Madison, in The Federalist No. 45, wrote,“The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.”.
:(5) The [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716 (1931), noted,“The Tenth Amendment was intended to confirm the understanding of the people at the time the Constitution was adopted, that powers not granted to the United States were reserved to the States or to the people.”.
:(6) The [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in Fry v. United States, 421 U.S. 542 (1975), also noted,“The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.”.
:(7) The Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government often promulgate regulations contrary to the spirit and letter of the 10th Amendment.
:(8) The 10th Amendment assures that the people of the United States, and each sovereign State in the Union of States, have, and have always had, rights that the Federal Government may not usurp.
:(9)   [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has the responsibility to safeguard the 10th Amendment and to recognize that it is as vital and valuable today as on the date of its ratification.
