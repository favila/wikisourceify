=Sec. 2. Findings and statement of policy=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability would—
::(A) embolden its already aggressive foreign policy, including its arming of terrorist organizations and other groups, its efforts to destabilize countries in the Middle East, and its efforts to target the United States, United States allies, and United States interests globally;
::(B) increase the risk that Iran would share its nuclear technology and expertise with extremist groups and rogue nations;
::(C) destabilize global energy markets, posing a direct and devastating threat to the American and global economy; and
::(D) likely lead other governments in the region to pursue their own nuclear weapons programs, increasing the prospect of nuclear proliferation throughout the region and effectively ending the viability of the global nonproliferation regime, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
:(2) A nuclear arms-capable Iran possessing intercontinental ballistic missiles, a development most experts expect could occur within a decade, would pose a direct nuclear threat to the United States.

==(b) Statement of policy– ==

It shall be the policy of the United States to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.
