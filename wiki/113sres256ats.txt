{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week of September 23 through 29, 2013, as“National Adult Education and Family Literacy Week”.    Whereas the National Assessment of Adult Literacy reports that 90,000,000 adults lack the literacy, numeracy, or English-language skills necessary to succeed at home, in the workplace, and in society;   Whereas the literacy of the people of the United States is essential for the economic and societal well-being of the United States;   Whereas the United States reaps the economic benefits of individuals who improve their literacy, numeracy, and English-language skills;   Whereas literacy and educational skills are necessary for individuals to fully benefit from the range of opportunities available in the United States;   Whereas the economy and position of the United States in the world marketplace depend on having a literate, skilled population;   Whereas the unemployment rate in the United States is highest among those without a high school diploma or an equivalent credential, demonstrating that education is important to economic recovery;   Whereas the educational skills of a child's parents and the practice of reading to a child have a direct impact on the educational success of the child;   Whereas parental involvement in a child's education is a key predictor of a child's success, and the level of parental involvement in a child's education increases as the educational level of the parent increases;   Whereas parents who participate in family literacy programs become more involved in their children's education and gain the tools necessary to obtain a job or find better employment;   Whereas, as a result of family literacy programs, the lives of children become more stable, and their success in the classroom and in future endeavors becomes more likely;   Whereas adults need to be part of a long-term solution to the educational challenges of the United States;   Whereas many older people in the United States lack the reading, math, or English skills necessary to read a prescription and follow medical instructions, which endangers their lives and the lives of their loved ones;   Whereas many individuals who are unemployed, underemployed, or receive public assistance lack the literacy skills necessary to obtain and keep a job to provide for their families, to continue their education, or to participate in job training programs;   Whereas many high school dropouts do not have the literacy skills necessary to complete their education, transition to postsecondary education or career and technical training, or obtain a job;   Whereas a large portion of individuals in prison have low educational skills, and prisoners without educational skills are more likely to return to prison once released;   Whereas many immigrants in the United States do not have the literacy skills necessary to succeed in the United States; and   Whereas National Adult Education and Family Literacy Week highlights the need to ensure each and every citizen has the literacy skills necessary to succeed at home, at work, and in society: Now, therefore, be it
