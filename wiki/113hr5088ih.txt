::(D) any other matters the [[w:U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims|Court]]determines appropriate.
:(6) In determining the class under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/7270 paragraph (3)], the [[w:U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims|Court]]may only include individuals who have, as of the date of the entry of judgment of the [[w:U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims|Court]]on the class action, filed a claim and such claim has not been finally resolved, including any appeals from a denial of such claim.
