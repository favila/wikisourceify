=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “ Fair Employment Opportunity Act of 2014” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that denial of employment opportunities to individuals because they are or have been unemployed is discriminatory and burdens commerce by—
:(1) reducing personal consumption and undermining economic stability and growth;
:(2) squandering human capital essential to the Nation’s economic vibrancy and growth;
:(3) increasing demands for Federal and State unemployment insurance benefits, reducing trust fund assets, and leading to higher payroll taxes for employers, cuts in benefits for jobless workers, or both;
:(4) imposing additional burdens on publicly funded health and welfare programs; and
:(5) depressing income, property, and other tax revenues that the Federal Government, States, and localities rely on to support operations and institutions essential to commerce.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to prohibit consideration of an individual’s status as unemployed in considering applicants for, screening for, or hiring for positions, except where a requirement related to employment status is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to successful performance in the job; and
:(2) to eliminate the burdens imposed on commerce due to the exclusion of such individuals from employment.
