{{Center|A BILL}}

To ensure the continuation of successful fisheries mitigation programs, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “National Mitigation Fisheries Coordination Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The operation of dams and other water diversion projects are for the benefit of the American public. They provide inexpensive energy, flood control, water storage for municipal and agricultural purposes, and opportunities for recreational boating and enjoyment. The construction and operation of these Federal water resources development projects have had impacts on many water systems, habitats, and their respective fish populations, resulting in the need to build and operate fish hatcheries to mitigate for aquatic resources affected by these projects.
:(2) In accordance with the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/742a 16 U.S.C. 742a et seq.] ), the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/661 16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.] ), the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1001 16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.] ), and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/4321 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] ), the [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] has established policy (501 FW 2) to seek to mitigate for fish, wildlife, and their habitats, and uses thereof, from the effects of land and water developments.
:(3) The [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|Service]] currently operates fish hatcheries that are involved in mitigation fishery activities related to construction and operation of Federal water resources development projects.
:(4) Inconsistency in authorities to construct and operate Federal water resources development projects has led to a myriad of mechanisms for funding and conducting Federal mitigation fishery activities. In most cases, Federal water project development agencies fund mitigation fishery costs. In some cases, the [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|Service]] expends its appropriations to offset or completely pay for mitigation fishery costs.
:(5) The water development agency should bear the financial responsibility for mitigation fishery costs incurred by the [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|Service]] .

=Sec. 3. Mitigation fishery activities=

The [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|Director of the Service]] shall impose a charge for conducting mitigation fishery activities.

==(d) Payment of charges– ==
