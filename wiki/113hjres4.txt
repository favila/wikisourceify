  Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote. Prior to each fiscal year, the [[Wikipedia:Executive Office of the President|President ]]shall transmit to the [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]a proposed budget for the United States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts.

The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by a joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House, which becomes law. The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts. The appropriate committees of the [[Wikipedia:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives ]]and the [[Wikipedia:United States Senate|Senate ]]shall report to their respective Houses implementing legislation to achieve a balanced budget without reducing the disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to achieve that goal. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States Government except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States Government except for those for repayment of debt principal. This article shall take effect beginning with the later of the second fiscal year beginning after its ratification or the first fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2022..
