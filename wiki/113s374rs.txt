This Act may be cited as the“ Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress makes the following findings:
:(1) Congress supports and respects the right to bear arms found in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
:(2) Congress supports the existing prohibition on a national firearms registry.
:(3) There are deficits in the background check system in effect before the date of enactment of this Act and the Department of Justice should make it a top priority to work with States to swiftly input missing records, including mental health records.
:(4) If the citizens of the United States agree that in order to promote safe and responsible gun ownership criminals and the mentally ill should be prohibited from possessing firearms, it should be incumbent upon all citizens to ensure weapons are not being transferred to such people.
