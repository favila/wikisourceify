{{section|H1E7A759CCDCE43F999983378D7C9C1E1|5545. Findings}}
The Congress finds the following:
(1)
The [[United States Public Health Service|Surgeon
				General of the Public Health Service]] has found that although 1 in 10 children
				and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of
				impairment, in any given year fewer than 1 in 3 of these children receives
				needed treatment. The short- and long-term consequences of untreated childhood
				mental disorders are costly, in both human and fiscal terms.

(2)
School counselors, school psychologists,
				other qualified psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, and school
				social workers are needed to help these children and to provide a variety of
				crucial support services.

(3)
Across the United
				States, there are insufficient resources for school-based counseling
				professionals, and often students do not get the help they need. The current
				national average ratio of students to school counselors in elementary and
				secondary schools is 471 to 1.

(4)
United States
				schools need more mental health professionals, and they need the flexibility to
				hire the professionals that will best serve their students.

(5)
According to the leading counseling,
				guidance, and mental health organizations, including the American School
				Counselor Association, the National Association of Social Psychologists, the
				National Association of Social Workers, and the School Social Work Association
				of America, the maximum recommended ratio of—
(A)
students to school
				counselors is 250 to 1;

(B)
students to school
				psychologists is 1,000 to 1; and

(C)
students to school
				social workers is 250 to 1.


(6)
In some States, 1
				school counselor typically serves over 1,000 students. Ratios for school
				psychologists and school social workers are also extremely high. In some
				schools, there are no school-based mental health and student service providers
				available to assist students in times of crisis, or at any other time.

(7)
The number of
				students is expected to grow significantly over the next few years. During this
				time, many school-based mental health professionals who currently serve the
				Nation’s youth will retire.

(8)
Model programs
				using school-based mental health and student service providers have reduced
				school suspensions, reduced referrals to the principal’s office, reduced the
				use of weapons, force, and threats, and increased students’ feelings of
				safety.


{{section|H480B48D17DEF4725A8AB13B675F4B626|5546. Purposes}}
The purposes of this chapter are to assist
				States and local educational agencies in hiring additional school-based mental
				health providers, including additional school counselors, school psychologists,
				other qualified psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, and school
				social workers to achieve each of the following:
(1)
To reduce the ratios of school-based mental
				health and student service providers to students in elementary and secondary
				schools in the United States to the following minimum ratios recommended by the
				leading counseling, guidance, and mental health organizations, including the
				American School Counselor Association, the National Association of Social
				Psychologists, the National Association of Social Workers, and the School
				Social Work Association of America:
(A)
One school
				counselor for every 250 students;

(B)
One school
				psychologist for every 1,000 students; and

(C)
One school social
				worker for every 250 students.


(2)
To provide
				school-based mental health and student services.

(3)
To remove
				emotional, behavioral, and psychosocial barriers to learning so as to enhance
				students' classroom preparedness and ability to learn.

(4)
To support school
				staff and teachers in improving classroom management, conducting behavioral
				interventions to improve school discipline, and developing the awareness and
				skills to identify early warning signs of violence and the need for mental
				health services.

(5)
To support
				parental involvement in improving the school behavior and academic success of
				their children.
