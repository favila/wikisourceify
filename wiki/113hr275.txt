{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a grant program to test and mitigate radon levels in public schools, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “End Radon in Schools Act”.

2. Establishment of grant program


=(a) In general=

Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this Act, not later than 1 year after the date that Federal funds are first appropriated for this Act, the Administrator of the [[Wikipedia:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency ]], in consultation with the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Education|Secretary of Education ]], shall establish a program under which the Administrator may award grants to States to conduct short-term radon testing to identify and mitigate unsafe radon levels in public schools.
=(b) Guidelines=

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[Wikipedia:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator ]]shall review, update, revise, and publish the Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines with current information and guidance on radon testing in a public school.
3. Grant awards


In carrying out the program under this Act, the [[Wikipedia:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator ]]shall—
: provide a grant award for each State selected to receive a grant under this Act to complete the testing under section 5(b) ;: in the case of a State that submits a report and is required to conduct mitigation under section 5(c)(1) —:: provide an additional grant award for the State to conduct such mitigation under such subparagraph (A) of such section; or:: conduct such mitigation under subparagraph (B) of such section; and: in the case of a State that submits a report and is required to conduct reevaluation under section 5(d) , provide an additional grant award for the State to complete the reevaluation.
4. Application; priority


=(a) Application=

To be eligible to receive a grant under this Act, a State shall submit an application to the [[Wikipedia:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator ]]in such manner, at such time, and containing such information as the Administrator may require, including a certification that the grant funds will be used to—: test the radon levels in public schools pursuant to section 5(b) ; and: mitigate the effects of unsafe radon levels in public schools pursuant to section 5(c) , determined by the test under paragraph (1) .
=(b) Priority=

In awarding grants to States under this Act, the [[Wikipedia:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator ]]shall—: determine the priority of grant awards by ranking each State that submits an application in relation to each other such State; and: in ranking States under paragraph (1) —:: assign highest priority to a State with 100 percent of such State’s landmass in Radon Zone 1;:: in a case in which multiple States have 100 percent of such States’ landmasses in Radon Zone 1, assign priority among such States at the Administrator’s discretion;:: assign second highest priority to a State with at least 50 percent of such State’s landmass in Radon Zone 1;:: in a case in which multiple States have at least 50 percent of such States’ landmasses in Radon Zone 1, assign priority among such States at the Administrator’s discretion; and:: in a case in which a State has less than 50 percent of such State’s landmass in Radon Zone 1, assign priority to such State at the Administrator’s discretion.
5. Use of funds


=(a) In general=

A State that receives a grant under this Act shall—: follow the Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b) ;: test radon levels in each public school pursuant to subsection (b) ;: if necessary, mitigate unsafe radon levels pursuant to subsection (c) ; and: if necessary, reevaluate mitigation pursuant to subsection (d) .
=(b) Testing=

A State that receives a grant under this Act shall—: conduct testing in each public school in such State consistent with the Administrator’s Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b) ;: submit a report to the [[Wikipedia:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator ]]—:: describing the results of each test conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) ; and:: if necessary, estimating the funds necessary to conduct an additional short-term test under paragraph (3) ; and: in the case of a school that should have additional testing, according to initial testing conducted under paragraph (1) , conduct such follow-up testing consistent with the Administrator’s Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b) .
=(c) Mitigation=


==(1) In general==

In the case of a public school at which testing conducted under paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (b) met the recommendations for mitigation in the Administrator’s Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b) —: if the State’s report under paragraph (2) includes the certification described in paragraph (2)(A) , the State shall mitigate the radon level at the public school by providing funds to the local educational agency serving such school to enable the agency to carry out the mitigation described in paragraph (3) ; or: if the State’s report under paragraph (2) does not include such certification, the Administrator shall carry out the mitigation described in paragraph (3) , directly or by contract funded under this grant program.
==(2) Certification; reporting==

A State that receives a grant under this Act shall—: if necessary, seek certification from each local educational agency that serves each public school described in paragraph (1) that such agency will, if provided funding pursuant to section 3(2)(A) , complete the actions described in paragraph (3) ; and: submit a report to the Administrator that—:: in the case in which a local educational agency provides certification to the State under subparagraph (A) , includes such certification;:: describes the results of each test at such public school conducted under subsection (b) ; and:: if necessary, estimates the funds necessary to conduct mitigation at such public school pursuant to paragraph (3) .
==(3) Mitigation Requirements==

In mitigating the radon levels at public schools, the [[Wikipedia:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator ]]or a local educational agency, as appropriate, shall—: work with a qualified radon mitigation professional to determine the most effective way to mitigate the radon at the public school;: create a mitigation plan within 3 months after the completion of the testing under subsection (b) ;: designate a mitigation unit and implement the mitigation plan under subparagraph (B) within one year after completion of the testing under subsection (b) ;: conduct a short-term test not less than once every two years; and: if necessary, conduct the reevaluation under subsection (d) .
=(d) Reevaluation=

If the follow-up testing under subsection (c)(3)(D) conducted after the mitigation plan is implemented results in a radon level that is still meeting the recommendations for mitigation in the Administrator’s Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b) , the local educational agency that serves the school shall—: reevaluate the mitigation plan under subsection (c)(3)(B) in consultation with a qualified radon mitigation professional;: create an alternative mitigation plan to replace the mitigation plan;: submit a report to the Administrator—:: describing the results of such annual test; and:: estimating the funds necessary to conduct reevaluation under this subsection; and: direct the mitigation unit to implement an alternative mitigation plan under subsection (c)(3) within 6 months after the date of the follow-up test.
