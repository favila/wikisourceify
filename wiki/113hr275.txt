To establish a grant program to test and mitigate radon levels in public schools, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“End Radon in Schools Act”.

Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this Act, not later than 1 year after the date that Federal funds are first appropriated for this Act, the Administrator of the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] , in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary of Education]] , shall establish a program under which the Administrator may award grants to States to conduct short-term radon testing to identify and mitigate unsafe radon levels in public schools.

==(b) Guidelines– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] shall review, update, revise, and publish the Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines with current information and guidance on radon testing in a public school.

=Sec. 3. Grant awards=

In carrying out the program under this Act, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] shall—
:(1) provide a grant award for each State selected to receive a grant under this Act to complete the testing under section 5(b);

:(1) test the radon levels in public schools pursuant to section 5(b); and
:(2) mitigate the effects of unsafe radon levels in public schools pursuant to section 5(c), determined by the test under paragraph (1).

==(b) Priority– ==

In awarding grants to States under this Act, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] shall—
:(1) determine the priority of grant awards by ranking each State that submits an application in relation to each other such State; and
:(2) in ranking States under paragraph (1)—
::(A) assign highest priority to a State with 100 percent of such State’s landmass in Radon Zone 1;
::(B) in a case in which multiple States have 100 percent of such States’ landmasses in Radon Zone 1, assign priority among such States at the Administrator’s discretion;
::(C) assign second highest priority to a State with at least 50 percent of such State’s landmass in Radon Zone 1;
::(D) in a case in which multiple States have at least 50 percent of such States’ landmasses in Radon Zone 1, assign priority among such States at the Administrator’s discretion; and
::(E) in a case in which a State has less than 50 percent of such State’s landmass in Radon Zone 1, assign priority to such State at the Administrator’s discretion.

=Sec. 5. Use of funds=



==(a) In general– ==

A State that receives a grant under this Act shall—
:(1) follow the Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b);
:(2) test radon levels in each public school pursuant to subsection (b);
:(3) if necessary, mitigate unsafe radon levels pursuant to subsection (c); and
:(4) if necessary, reevaluate mitigation pursuant to subsection (d).

==(b) Testing– ==

A State that receives a grant under this Act shall—

:(2) submit a report to the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] —
::(A) describing the results of each test conducted pursuant to paragraph (1); and
::(B) if necessary, estimating the funds necessary to conduct an additional short-term test under paragraph (3); and
:(3) in the case of a school that should have additional testing, according to initial testing conducted under paragraph (1), conduct such follow-up testing consistent with the Administrator’s Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b).

==(c) Mitigation– ==

In the case of a public school at which testing conducted under paragraphs (1)and (3) of subsection (b)met the recommendations for mitigation in the Administrator’s Radon Measurements In Schools Guidelines updated pursuant to section 2(b)—
:(A) if the State’s report under paragraph (2)includes the certification described in paragraph (2)(A), the State shall mitigate the radon level at the public school by providing funds to the local educational agency serving such school to enable the agency to carry out the mitigation described in paragraph (3); or
:(B) if the State’s report under paragraph (2)does not include such certification, the Administrator shall carry out the mitigation described in paragraph (3), directly or by contract funded under this grant program.
