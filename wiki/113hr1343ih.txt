{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to award grants for science, technology, engineering, and math education programs.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Project Ready STEM Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings and Purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Employment projections forecast a 17 percent growth in the STEM fields over the next decade.
:(2) Ninety-two percent of STEM occupations will require at least some post-secondary education.
:(3) While the number of degrees awarded in STEM fields has increased steadily since the 1960s, the overall share of STEM degrees awarded has actually shrunk in comparison to all degrees conferred.
:(4) Internationally, a larger proportion of all degrees awarded are in the STEM fields. While 16 percent of degrees awarded in the United States are in STEM fields, nearly 50 percent of degrees awarded in China, 38 percent in South Korea, and 28 percent in Germany are in STEM fields.
:(5) Minorities are seriously underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce in the United States, with just under 6 percent of Blacks and over 5 percent of Hispanics participating in the STEM workforce.
:(6) Twenty-one percent of Black college students enter college with STEM majors, but only 16 percent actually receive a bachelor’s degree in a STEM major.
:(7) Over½of Black students that enroll in a 4-year university are interested in STEM, but are not proficient in math.
:(8) Since 1990, mathematic scores on the assessments conducted by the National Assessment of Education Progress have increased for all students, but White students have average scores 27 points higher than Black and Hispanic students.
:(9) After school programs play an important role in addressing the achievement gap in underserved communities. Studies demonstrate that STEM learning during the school day is necessary but not sufficient for life-long STEM literacy.
:(10) As many as 8,400,000 students are enrolled in after school programs. Ethnic minority children are more likely than non-minority children to participate in after school programs. While 15 percent of all students are enrolled in after school programs, 24 percent of Black students and 21 percent of Hispanic students are enrolled in such programs.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to prepare middle school and secondary school students to be ready for opportunities in the STEM fields in college and in careers through strong after school, summer, and weekend programs that focus on STEM education. 

=Sec. 3. Amendment to ESEA for STEM grants=

   Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6601 20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.])is amended—
:(1) in the heading, by inserting“ and STEM Grants ”after“ Partnerships ”;
:(2) by inserting after the heading of part B the following:

<blockquote> 

==1 Math and Science Partnerships– ==

 ; 
</blockquote>
and
:(3) by inserting after section 2203 the following new subpart:

<blockquote> 

==2 STEM Grants– ==



==Sec. 2211. Project ready STEM grant program==



===(a) Authorization– ===

The [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] is authorized to award grants, to be known as Project Ready STEM Program grants, to national and regional intermediaries to establish in-school, after school, summer, and weekend programs that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (referred to in this section as STEM ) education.

===(b) Application– ===

A national or regional intermediary seeking a grant under this section shall submit an application to the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] at such time, in such form, and containing such information as the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] may reasonably require, including the following:
:(1) The amount requested and the proposed use of the funds.
:(2) A description of how the national or regional intermediary will require a community-based affiliate operating a Project Ready STEM Program to provide the following:
::(A) A program description, including a description of—
:::(i) the project-based learning that the program will use and the applicability of such projects to students’ lives after graduation from secondary school;
:::(ii) the academic instruction, research model, or curriculum that the program will use; and
:::(iii) any service-learning opportunities that will be available to students.
::(B) Evidence that the Project Ready STEM Program will primarily serve students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM field careers.
::(C) A description of the student recruitment plan, student retention plan, and parental engagement plan.
::(D) A description of the professional development and training that the community-based affiliate will provide to its Project Ready STEM Program staff.
::(E) A description of the community-based affiliate’s collaboration with an institution of higher education (as defined in  section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/10001 20 U.S.C. 10001])).
::(F) A description of how the community-based affiliate will enable students who participate in the program to achieve the goals in subsection (c) .

===(c) Goals– ===

The goals of the Project Ready STEM Programs are the following:
:(1) To increase awareness of and exposure to current science content, scientific processes, and tools for students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM field careers.
:(2) To provide STEM learning that is connected to workforce skills that are essential in the 21st century.
:(3) To increase on time grade promotion, the number of students who graduate high school, and the number of students who pursue opportunities in STEM fields.
:(4) To increase enrollment in and completion of more STEM related coursework in school for students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM field careers.
:(5) To increase awareness of students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM field careers of the opportunities after graduation from secondary school in STEM fields, including college majors in STEM and careers in STEM.
:(6) For students to have the experience of interacting with staff who demonstrate a positive attitude toward STEM fields.
:(7) To facilitate project-based learning and service-learning.

===(d) Allocation– ===

A national or regional intermediary that receives a grant under this section shall reserve—
:(1) not more than 25 percent to provide technical and administrative assistance to and collect data from its community-based affiliates to which it makes subgrants;
