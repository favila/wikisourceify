==Sec. 1860D–11A. Medicare operated prescription drug plan option==



===(a) In general– ===

Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, for each year (beginning with 2012), in addition to any plans offered under section 1860D–11, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall offer one or more Medicare operated prescription drug plans (as defined in subsection (c)) with a service area that consists of the entire United States and shall enter into negotiations in accordance with subsection (b) with pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D drugs for eligible part D individuals who enroll in such a plan.

===(b) Negotiations– ===

Notwithstanding section 1860D–11(i), for purposes of offering a Medicare operated prescription drug plan under this section, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to the purchase price of covered part D drugs in a Medicare operated prescription drug plan and shall encourage the use of more affordable therapeutic equivalents to the extent such practices do not override medical necessity as determined by the prescribing physician. To the extent practicable and consistent with the previous sentence, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall implement strategies similar to those used by other Federal purchasers of prescription drugs, and other strategies, including the use of a formulary and formulary incentives in subsection (e), to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D drugs.

===(c) Medicare operated prescription drug plan defined– ===

For purposes of this part, the term Medicare operated prescription drug plan means a prescription drug plan that offers qualified prescription drug coverage and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D–2(a)(1)(A).

====(1) Qualified prescription drug coverage– ====

The monthly beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D–2(a)(1)(A)to be charged under a Medicare operated prescription drug plan shall be uniform nationally. Such premium for months in 2014 and each succeeding year shall be based on the average monthly per capita actuarial cost of offering the Medicare operated prescription drug plan for the year involved, including administrative expenses.

====(2) Supplemental prescription drug coverage– ====

Insofar as a Medicare operated prescription drug plan offers supplemental prescription drug coverage, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may adjust the amount of the premium charged under paragraph (1).

====(1) In general– ====

With respect to the operation of a Medicare operated prescription drug plan, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall establish and apply a formulary (and may include formulary incentives described in paragraph (2)(C)(ii)) in accordance with this subsection in order to—
