=Sec. 2. Findings; purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) A highly skilled and agile workforce is necessary to compete in the global economy and maintain the standard of living of the United States.
:(2) According to a 2011 report by the Alliance for Excellent Education, nearly 7,000 students drop out of high school every day. Annually, 1,200,000 students will not graduate from high school with their peers as scheduled.
:(3) High school dropouts have a high social cost. According to a 2009 study by Northeastern University, when compared to high school graduates, high school dropouts will cost the taxpayers an average of $292,000. And for high school dropouts between the ages of 16 and 24, incarceration rates are 63 times higher than among college graduates.
:(4) According to the [[w:Bureau of the Census|United States Census Bureau]] , on average a student who drops out of high school will have an annual income $20,241. That is $10,386 less than an individual with a high school diploma, and $36,424 less than an individual with a bachelor’s degree.
:(5) According to the [[w:National Center for Education Statistics|National Center for Education Statistics]] , 21 percent of first-year undergraduate students in the 2007–2008 academic school year reported taking at least one remedial course. Twenty-four percent of first-time undergraduate community college students reported taking a least one remedial course.
:(6) According to a 2011 report by the American College Testing Program (ACT), by 2018, 30,000,000 new and replacement jobs will require some postsecondary education. The current decline in postsecondary credential attainment threatens the ability of American businesses to compete globally. Currently, about 90,000,000 Americans (half of the U.S. workforce) lack the skills required to function well in the global economy or to earn family sustaining wages.
:(7) According to the findings of a 2006 study conducted by the American College Testing Program (ACT), the skills required for high school students to be ready to successfully enter postsecondary education and to enter workforce training programs are comparable. The report found that high school graduates need a comparable level of readiness in reading and mathematics to enter college-level courses without remediation and to enter workforce training programs in jobs that are likely to offer family-supporting wages and the potential for career advancement.
:(8) According to a 2003 report for the Educational Testing Service, about 40 percent of American adults do not have skills typical of those with some college, but the fastest job growth will occur in those jobs in which incumbent workers currently have skill levels reflecting at least some postsecondary education.
:(9) An increase in a country’s overall level of educational attainment leads to an increase in its overall rate of economic growth. According to a 2009 Mckinsey & Company report, if the United States had in recent years closed the gap between its educational achievement levels and those of better-performing nations such as Finland and Korea, gross domestic product in 2008 could have been $1,300,000,000 to $2,300,000,000 higher. This represents 9 to 16 percent of gross domestic product.
:(10) According to the American College Testing Program’s (ACT) analysis of the data from a 2009 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development repot, if current trends in postsecondary credential attainment continue for the United States, the next generation of American workers will be less educated than the previous generation for the first time in the history of the United States.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to increase the graduation rate of students from high school;
:(2) to increase the number of high school students prepared with 21st century skills for college-level work and workforce development after graduation from secondary school;
:(3) to improve the long-term labor market prospects for young people;
:(4) to establish State and regional partnerships among education, business, labor, and workforce and economic development leaders for the purposes of—
::(A) creating or enhancing educational pathways for high school students to postsecondary education, including registered apprenticeship programs, and to 21st century careers;
::(B) aligning the requirements for successfully exiting secondary education and entering postsecondary education and workforce development; and
::(C) developing a coherent vision for community development that complements and coordinates ongoing and new efforts in education and workforce and economic development;
:(5) to increase the use of industry-based skill standards, such as those certifications developed by the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council and the National Institute for Metalworking Skills; and
:(6) to increase the number of highly skilled and agile workers available to employers, particularly in high skill, high demand industries.
