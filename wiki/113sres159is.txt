{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate condemning the targeting of Tea Party groups by the Internal Revenue Service and calling for an investigation.    Whereas it is a well-founded principle that the power to tax involves the power to destroy;   Whereas employees of the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]](commonly known as the“IRS”) have publicly admitted that the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]targeted Tea Party groups in a manner that infringes on the free association rights and free speech rights of those groups;   Whereas the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]admitted that employees of the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]engaged in politically discriminatory actions;   Whereas the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]used the taxing power as a political tool to intimidate Tea Party groups from engaging in free speech;   Whereas, according to media reports, as early as in 2010, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]was targeting Tea Party groups;   Whereas
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]]is aware that a Federal agency under his control has admitted to targeting Tea Party groups;   Whereas, according to media reports, a report by the [[w:Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration|Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration]]indicates that some Tea Party groups withdrew applications for tax-exempt status as a result of the discriminatory actions of the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]];   Whereas, according to the Washington Post, in late June 2011, employees of the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]discussed giving special attention to case files in which groups made statements that“<nowiki>criticize[d] how the country is being run</nowiki>”and educated the people of the United States“on the Constitution and Bill of Rights”and targeting groups interested in limiting government; and   Whereas the discriminatory actions of the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]impacted the free speech rights of the groups targeted by the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]that—
:(1) the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]]engaged in discriminatory behavior;
:(2)   [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]should use existing authority—
::(A) to investigate potential criminal wrongdoing by individuals who authorized or were involved in targeting people of the United States based on their political views; and
::(B) to determine if other entities in the administration of
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]]were involved in or were aware of the discrimination and did not take action to stop the actions of the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]];
:(3)  
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]]should terminate the individuals responsible for targeting and willfully discriminating against Tea Party groups and other conservative groups; and
:(4) the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]condemns the actions of all individuals and entities involved in the infringement of the First Amendment rights of members of the Tea Party and other affected groups.
