=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Public Access to Public Science Act” .

=Sec. 2. Public access policy=



==(a) In general– ==

Each covered agency shall formulate and implement a public access policy to make covered works publicly available, without charge, on the day after the end of the embargo period, in a manner consistent with copyright law.

==(b) Specifications– ==

The public access policy shall—
:(1) allow the public to read, download, and analyze by machine covered works in digital form;

:(3) encourage public-private collaboration to—
::(A) maximize the potential for interoperability between public and private platforms;
::(B) avoid unnecessary duplication of existing mechanisms; and
::(C) maximize the impact of the covered agency’s research investment;
:(4) ensure that attribution to authors, journals, and original publishers is maintained; and
:(5) ensure that publications and metadata are stored in an archive that—
::(A) provides for long-term preservation and access to full content of the covered work without charge, where appropriate, and balancing cost and public value;
::(B) uses a standard, widely available, and, to the extent possible, nonproprietary archival format for text and associated content, including images, video, and supporting data;
::(C) provides access for persons with disabilities consistent with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/794d 29 U.S.C. 794d] ); and

Notwithstanding subsection (a), a covered agency’s public access policy shall ensure full public access to covered works’ metadata without charge upon first publication in a data format that ensures interoperability with current and anticipated future search technology. Where possible, the metadata shall provide a link to the location where the full text and associated supplemental materials will be made available at the end of the applicable embargo period.

=Sec. 3. Formulation of a public access policy=



==(a) In general– ==

Each public access policy shall include—
:(1) a strategy for enabling the public to electronically locate and access publications resulting from federally funded scientific research;
:(2) a strategy for maintaining a repository or repositories, either within the covered agency or through an arrangement with another Federal agency or agencies or through an arrangement with a public or private entity, if consistent with the purposes of this Act, including free public access in perpetuity, interoperability, and long-term preservation, so long as the covered agency maintains an active Web link to the repository or repositories for public access;
:(3) a strategy for incorporating existing covered works into the repository or repositories required under paragraph (2)to the extent practicable;
:(4) a strategy for notifying research funding recipients of their obligations under this Act; and
:(5) a strategy for taking into account different funding models for scholarly publishing, including author-pays fees, in the covered agency’s grant and other funding mechanisms.

==(b) Coordination with stakeholders– ==

In developing its public access policy, the covered agency shall use a transparent process for soliciting views from stakeholders, including federally funded researchers, institutions of higher education, libraries, publishers, users of federally funded research results, and civil society groups.

==(c) Coordination with other Federal agencies– ==

In developing its public access policy, the covered agency shall collaborate and coordinate with other Federal agencies to maximize the consistency and compatibility of public access across the Federal Government.

==(d) Report to Congress– ==

Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, each covered agency shall transmit a report, containing its public access policy and the mechanism described in section 6, to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]] and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]] .
