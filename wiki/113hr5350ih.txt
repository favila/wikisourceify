<blockquote> 

==(i) Claims made for solid antimicrobial copper alloys– ==



===(1) Certain claims authorized– ===

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, solid antimicrobial copper alloys, and products made from such alloys, may be marketed, distributed, or sold with labeling making claims regarding the microbial reduction or infection control efficacy of the alloys if the claims are consistent with the results of—
:(A) federally-funded clinical trials finding greater than 25 percent reductions in infection rate or 50 percent reductions in microbial burden; or
:(B) federally-funded clinical trials finding statistically significant reductions in infection rate or microbial burden.

===(2) Submission or review of efficacy data waived– ===

The registration of solid antimicrobial copper alloys under this section shall not require submission or review of efficacy data related to claims consistent with the results of the clinical trials described in paragraph (1).
