{{Center|A BILL}}

To prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On May 10, 2013, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] admitted that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, seeking tax-exempt status.
:(2) This action raises pertinent questions about the agency’s ability to implement and oversee[[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]] and[[Public Law -|Public Law 111–152]] .
:(3) This action could be an indication of future Internal Revenue Service abuses in relation to[[Public Law -|Public Law 111–148]] and[[Public Law -|Public Law 111–152]] given that it is their responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual mandate.
:(4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the Federal Government.

=Sec. 3. Prohibiting enforcement of PPACA and HCERA=

The [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] , or any delegate of the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] , shall not implement or enforce any provisions of or amendments made by[[Public Law -|Public Law 111–148]] or[[Public Law 111-152|111–152]] .
