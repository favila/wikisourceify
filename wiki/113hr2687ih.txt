==Title VII— Policy Provisions==



==Sec. 701. Asteroid Retrieval Mission==



===(a) In General– ===

Consistent with the policy stated in section 201(b), the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]] may not fund the development of an asteroid retrieval mission to send a robotic spacecraft to a near-Earth asteroid for rendezvous, retrieval, and redirection of that asteroid to lunar orbit for exploration by astronauts.

===(b) Asteroid survey– ===

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] may not pursue a program to search for asteroids of 20 meters or less in diameter unless the survey program described in section 322(c)is at least 90 percent complete.

===(c) Report– ===

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]] shall provide to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]] and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]] a report on the proposed Asteroid Retrieval Mission. Such report shall include—
:(1) a detailed budget profile, including cost estimates for the development of all necessary technologies and spacecraft required for the mission;
:(2) a detailed technical plan that includes milestones and a specific schedule;
:(3) a description of the technologies and capabilities anticipated to be gained from the proposed mission that will enable future human missions to Mars which could not be gained by lunar missions; and
:(4) a complete review by the Small Bodies Assessment Group and the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA Advisory Council]] that includes a recommendation to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] on the feasibility of the mission as proposed by the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] .

==Sec. 702. Termination liability==



===(a) Findings– ===

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The International Space Station, the Space Launch System, and the Orion crew capsule will enable the Nation to continue operations in low-Earth orbit and to send its astronauts to deep space. As a result of their unique capabilities and their critical contribution to the future of space exploration, these systems have been designated by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] as priority investments.
:(2) While the Space Launch System and the Orion programs, currently under development, have made significant progress, they have not been funded at levels authorized, and as a result congressionally authorized milestones will be delayed by several years.
:(3) In addition, contractors are currently holding program funding, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, to cover the potential termination liability should the Government choose to terminate a program for convenience. As a result, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are unavailable for meaningful work on these programs.
:(4) According to the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] , the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] procures most of its goods and services through contracts, and it terminates very few of them. In fiscal year 2010, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] terminated 28 of 16,343 active contracts and orders—a termination rate of about 0.17 percent.
:(5) Providing processes requiring congressional action on termination of these high-priority programs would enable contractors to apply taxpayer dollars to making maximum progress in meeting the established technical goals and schedule milestones of these programs.

===(b) NASA termination liability– ===



====(1) General rule– ====

Termination liability costs for a covered program shall be provided only pursuant to this subsection.

====(2) Prohibition on reserving funds– ====

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]] may not reserve funds from amounts appropriated for a covered program, and shall direct prime contractors not to reserve funds, for potential termination liability costs with respect to a covered program.

====(3) Intent of Congress– ====

It is the intent of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that funds authorized to be appropriated for covered programs be applied in meeting established technical goals and schedule milestones.

====(4) Void contractual provisions– ====

Any provision in a prime contract entered into before the date of enactment of this Act that provides for the payment of termination liability costs through any means other than as provided in this subsection is hereby declared to be void and unenforceable.

====(5) Congressional action; notice– ====



=====(A) Termination for convenience– =====

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]] may not initiate termination for the convenience of the Government of a prime contract on a covered program unless such program termination is authorized or required by a law enacted after the date of enactment of this Act.

=====(B) Termination for cause– =====

The [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]] shall notify the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]] and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]] before initiating termination for cause of a prime contract on a covered program.

====(6) Supplemental appropriation request– ====



=====(A) Request– =====

If the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]] decides to terminate a prime contract on a covered program, and sufficient unobligated appropriations are not available to cover termination liability costs in the appropriations account that is funding the prime contract being terminated, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administrator]] shall provide to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] a notification that an authorization of appropriations is necessary not later than 120 days in advance of the proposed contract settlement for the covered program.

=====(B) Intent of Congress– =====

It is the intent of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to provide additional authorization for appropriations as may be necessary to pay termination liability costs on prime contracts for covered programs if [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] deems it appropriate that the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] terminate such prime contracts.

====(7) Definitions– ====
