 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:

The labor force participation rate of mothers with children under the age of 6 was 63.9 percent in 2011 compared with 39 percent in 1975.
:(3) Nationwide, on any given day, 4.6 million children under the age of 5 are in child care outside the home.
:(4) In 40 States, the average annual cost for center-based care for an infant is higher than a year’s tuition and related fees at a 4-year public college.
