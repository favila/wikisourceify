[[w:William Enyart|Mr. Enyart]] (for himself and
[[w:Rodney L. Davis|Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois]] ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for the safe and reliable navigation of the Mississippi River, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Mississippi River Navigation Sustainment Act”.

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the Mississippi River is the largest, most famous river in the United States and a vital natural resource;
:(2) the Mississippi River Basin is the third largest watershed in the world, covering more than 1,000,000 square miles and approximately 40 percent of the continental United States;
:(3) the rivers, tributaries, and reservoirs that make up the Mississippi River Basin operate naturally as a system and any attempt to operate projects within the Mississippi River Basin by mankind should take this fact into consideration;
:(4) the Mississippi River is the backbone of the inland waterway system of the United States and a crucial artery for the movement of goods;
:(5) each year millions of tons of commodities, including grain, coal, petroleum, and chemicals, representing billions of dollars are transported on the Mississippi River by barge;
:(6) the Mississippi River is home to some of the busiest commercial ports in the United States, including the Port of New Orleans and the Port of St. Louis;
:(7) safe and reliable navigation of the Mississippi River is vital to the national economy;
:(8) extreme weather events pose challenges to navigation and life along the Mississippi River and are likely to become more severe and more frequent in the coming years, as evidenced by the devastating floods along the Mississippi River in 2011 and the near historic low water levels seen on the same stretch of the Mississippi River in the winter of 2012–2013;
:(9) the American Waterways Operators and the Waterways Council, Incorporated have estimated that a disruption of navigation on the Mississippi River due to low water levels between December 2012 and January 2013 would have negatively impacted 20,000 jobs and $7,000,000,000 in cargo;
:(10) the Regulating Works Program of the St. Louis District of the Corps of Engineers is critical to maintaining navigation on the middle Mississippi River during extreme weather events and should receive continued Federal financial assistance and support; and
:(11) the Federal Government, commercial users, and others have a shared responsibility to take steps to maintain the critical flow of goods on the Mississippi River during extreme weather events.

=Sec. 3. Definitions=



==(a) Extreme weather– ==

The term extreme weather means—
:(1) severe flooding and drought conditions that lead to above or below average water levels; or
:(2) other severe weather events that threaten personal safety, property, and navigation on the inland waterways of the United States.

==(b) Greater Mississippi River Basin– ==

The term greater Mississippi River Basin means the area covered by hydrologic units 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, as identified by the [[w:United States Geological Survey|United States Geological Survey]] as of the date of enactment of this Act.

==(c) Lower Mississippi River– ==

The term lower Mississippi River means the portion of the Mississippi River that begins at the confluence of the Ohio River and flows to the Gulf of Mexico.

==(d) Middle Mississippi River– ==

The term middle Mississippi River means the portion of the Mississippi River that begins at the confluence of the Missouri River and flows to the lower Mississippi River.

==(e) Secretary– ==

The term Secretary means the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers.

=Sec. 4. Greater Mississippi River Basin Extreme Weather Management Study=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary]] shall carry out a study of the Mississippi River Basin—
:(1) to improve the coordinated and comprehensive management of water resource projects in the greater Mississippi River Basin relating to extreme weather conditions; and
:(2) to evaluate the feasibility of any modifications to those water resource projects and develop new water resource projects to improve the reliability of navigation and more effectively reduce flood risk.

==(b) Contents– ==

The study shall—
:(1) identify any Federal actions necessary to prevent and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather, including changes to authorized channel dimensions, operational procedures of locks and dams, and reservoir management within the Mississippi River Basin;
:(2) evaluate the effect on navigation and flood risk management to the Mississippi River of all upstream rivers and tributaries, especially the confluence of the Illinois River, Missouri River, and Ohio River;
:(3) identify and make recommendations to remedy challenges to the [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] presented by extreme weather, including river access, in carrying out its mission to maintain safe, reliable navigation; and
:(4) identify and locate natural or other potential impediments to maintaining navigation on the middle and lower Mississippi River during periods of low water, including existing industrial pipeline crossings.

==(c) Consultation and use of existing data– ==

In carrying out the study, the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary]] shall—
:(1) consult with appropriate committees of Congress, Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies, environmental interests, river navigation industry representatives, other shipping and business interests, organized labor, and nongovernmental organizations;
:(2) to the maximum extent practicable, use data in existence on the date of enactment of this Act; and
:(3) incorporate lessons learned and best practices developed as a result of past extreme weather events, including major floods and the successful effort to maintain navigation during the near historic low water levels on the Mississippi River during the winter of 2012–2013.

==(d) Cost-Sharing– ==

The Federal share of the cost of carrying out the study under this section shall be 100 percent.

==(e) Report– ==

Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of the Army|Secretary]] shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] a report on the study carried out under this section.

=Sec. 5. Mississippi River forecasting improvements=
