 To preserve the constitutional authority of Congress and ensure accountability and transparency in legislation.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Read the Bills Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Constitutional authority statement=



==(a) In general– ==

This Act is enacted pursuant to the power conferred by the Constitution of the United States upon each House of Congress by—
:(1) article I, section 5, clauses 2 and 3 to determine the rules and keep a journal of its proceedings, respectively;
:(2) article I, section 7, clause 2 to ensure that bills that become law have been actually passed by, not just passed through, each House of Congress; and
:(3) article I, section 8, clause 18, which authorizes [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]to make all laws that are necessary and proper for carrying into execution the rules of each House of Congress.

==(b) Standing provision– ==

The provision of this Act under which any person who is aggrieved by the enforcement of any law enacted either in violation of the rules of proceedings of either House of Congress, or by the suspension of the rules, as prescribed herein, shall have standing in a court of law, is enacted pursuant to article III, section 2 of the Constitution of the United States. 

=Sec. 3. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The Constitution of the United States vests all legislative powers granted therein in [[w:United States Congress|Congress]].
:(2) Each Member of Congress is elected by the people to whom the Member is accountable, and Members must represent the people of their respective State or District in exercising their legislative powers.
:(3) Establishing a Government of enumerated powers, article I, section 1 of the Constitution of the United States obliges [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]to exercise only those legislative powers provided for in the Constitution of the United States, and article VI of the Constitution of the United States requires that each Member of Congress be bound by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution of the United States by enacting only those laws, and making only those resolutions, that are pursuant to the Constitution of the United States and not prohibited thereby.
:(4) To ensure that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]is politically and legally accountable to the people, article I, section 5 of the Constitution of the United States requires each House of Congress to keep a journal of its proceedings and from time to time publish the same.
:(5) To ensure that no legislation is passed without effective representation of the interests of the people by the elected Members of Congress, article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States provides that only a bill “which shall have passed the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]],” and not vetoed by the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]], shall“become a law”.
:(6) According to section I of the Manual of Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of the United States, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1801 (referred to in this section as“Jefferson's Manual”<nowiki>), “nothing tended more to throw power into the hands of administration and those who acted with the majority … than a neglect of, or departure from, the rules of proceeding [which] operated as a check and control of the actions of the majority [and] a shelter and protection to the minority”.</nowiki>
:(7) According to sections XXII and XL of Jefferson's Manual, it was the rule of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]that every bill receive 3 readings, 2 full readings by the [[w:United States Senate|Clerk of the Senate]], and a third reading of the title of the bill only, because “every member of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]<nowiki>had a printed copy [of the bill] in his hand.”.</nowiki>
:(8) According to sections XXIV, XXV, and XL of Jefferson's Manual, it was the rule of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], following the parliamentary procedure of the English House of Commons, that every bill receive 2 full readings by the [[w:United States House of Representatives|Clerk of the House of Representatives]], and a reading of the whole contents of the bill verbatim by the [[w:United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]]before the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]voted on the bill.
:(9) Under the current rules of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]], the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]has departed from its original practice of a full first and second reading of each bill, and of ensuring that each Senator has a printed or other verbatim copy of each bill before passage thereof, having by rule XIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate limited each reading of a bill to the reading of the title of the bill only, unless the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]in any case shall otherwise order.
:(10) Under the current rules of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]has by rule XVI (8) and rule XVIII (5) embraced its original practice of full first and second readings of each bill, but has regularly departed from this practice by unanimous consent of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and has dispensed altogether its original practice of a verbatim third reading of each bill before passage, limiting such third reading to the reading of the title only, including the reading of the title only even when Members of the House of Representatives have no printed or other verbatim copy of the bill before passage.
:(11) Although[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/106 section 106 of title 1, United States Code], requires a bill to be made available in written form to each Member of Congress before final passage, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has by statute conferred upon itself the power, during the last 6 days of a session of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]], by concurrent resolution, to vote for passage of a bill that is not in written form at the time of final passage.
:(12) As a direct consequence of the departure of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]and the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]from the salutary practice of full, verbatim readings of each bill before final passage, and further, as a direct consequence of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]], by concurrent resolution and otherwise, having permitted certain appropriation, budget, and regulatory bills to be enacted into law without such bills being printed and presented to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]in written form prior to final passage, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has—
::(A) imposed upon the people of the United States excessively long bills, largely written by an unelected bureaucracy, resulting in generally incomprehensible, cumbersome, oppressive, and burdensome laws, containing hidden provisions for special interests;
::(B) deprived the people of the United States and their elected Senators and Members of a full and fair opportunity to examine the text of bills, and all amendments thereto, prior to passage;
::(C) undermined the confidence of the people of the United States as a result of its failure to provide adequate notice to the people before a vote is taken on the bills and amendments thereto; and
::(D) has called into question the integrity and reliability of the legislative processes in both Houses of Congress by its failure to ensure that each Senator and each Member of the House of Representatives has, prior to passage, either listened attentively to the reading of the full text of each bill, and amendments thereto, or has personally read the text thereof.
:(13) Federal law currently sets forth various requirements relating to the form of bills and resolutions, and the procedure for enacting laws, including—
::(A) the form of the enacting clause of all Acts of Congress ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/101  section 101of title 1, United States Code]);
::(B) the form of the resolving clause of all joint resolutions ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/102  section 102of title 1, United States Code]);
::(C) a limitation on the use of enacting or resolving words ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/103  section 103of title 1, United States Code]);
::(D) the requirement regarding the numbering of sections and the requirement that each contain a single proposition ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/104  section 104of title 1, United States Code]);
::(E) the style and title for all bills making appropriations ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/105  section 105of title 1, United States Code]); and
::(F) the process by which each bill or joint resolution is handled after passage ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/106 section 106 of title 1, United States Code]).
