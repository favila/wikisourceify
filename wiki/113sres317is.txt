{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate on the continuing relationship between the United States and Georgia.    Whereas Georgia is a highly valued partner of the United States and has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to advancing the mutual interests of both countries, including through the deployment of Georgian forces as part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, where Georgia is currently the largest non-NATO contributor and serving without caveats in Helmand Province, and the Multi-National Force in Iraq;   Whereas, contrary to international law and the 2008 ceasefire agreement between Russia and Georgia, Russian forces have constructed barriers, including barbed wire and fences, along the administrative boundary line for the South Ossetia region of Georgia;   Whereas this“borderization”is inconsistent with Russia’s international commitments under the August 2008 ceasefire agreement, is contrary to Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, creates hardship and significant negative impacts for populations on both sides of these barriers, and is detrimental to long-term conflict resolution;   Whereas the peaceful transfer of power as the result of the October 2012 parliamentary elections in Georgia represents a major accomplishment toward the creation by the people of Georgia of a free society and full democracy;   Whereas the Presidential election of October 2013 marks another step in this transition to a free and open democracy in Georgia;   Whereas international election observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) concluded that the election“<nowiki>was efficiently administered, transparent, and took place in an amicable and constructive environment […]. Fundamental freedoms of expression, movement and assembly were respected, and candidates were able to campaign without restriction. […] A wide range of views and information was made available to voters through the media, providing candidates with a platform to present their programmes and opinions freely</nowiki>”;   Whereas such election conduct is consistent with actions that demonstrate progress toward a mature and free democracy; and   Whereas, on November 29, 2013, Georgia initialed an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), making Georgia a member of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, removing significant trade restrictions with the European Union, and signifying an important preliminary step towards the signing and eventual implementation of the Association Agreement by all European Union members states and Georgia: Now, therefore, be it
