To establish within the Department of Education the Innovation Inspiration school grant program, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H2B6375A91E63432C8B3BA15597B758FF}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Innovation Inspiration School Grant Program Act”.

={{anchor|HEA97D525B69C4C57BD01A55404023E68}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) According to the National Science Board’s 2010 Science and Engineering Indicators, only 5 percent of American college graduates major in engineering. In Asia, about 20 percent of all baccalaureate degrees are in engineering and in China about 33 percent of baccalaureate degrees are in engineering.
:(2) Although 4th graders in the United States score well against international competition, students in the United States fall near the bottom or dead last by 12th grade in mathematics and science, respectively.
:(3) Admissions requirements for undergraduate engineering schools include a solid background in mathematics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus) and science (biology, chemistry, and physics), in addition to courses in English, social studies, and humanities.
:(4) According to the [[w:Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor Statistics]] , overall engineering employment is expected to grow by 11 percent from 2008 through 2018, and, as a group, engineers earn some of the highest average starting salaries among individuals holding baccalaureate degrees.
:(5) According to the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] , engineers should be creative, inquisitive, analytical, and detail-oriented. Engineers should be able to work as part of a team and to communicate well, both orally and in writing. Communication abilities are becoming increasingly important as engineers interact more frequently with specialists in a wide range of fields outside engineering.
:(6) Exposure to project- and problem-based learning, in a competitive team environment, gives 9th through 12th graders the skills that they need to be successful in engineering programs of study and engineering careers.
:(7) According to Brandeis University’s Center for Youth and Communities, participants in FIRST Robotics (a nonprofit organization that inspires young people to be science and technology leaders by engaging the young people in mentor-based programs)—
::(A) are more likely than nonparticipants to attend an institution of higher education on a full-time basis (88 percent versus 53 percent);
::(B) are nearly 2 times as likely to major in a science or engineering field; and
::(C) are more than 3 times as likely to have majored specifically in engineering.
