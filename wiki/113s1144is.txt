[[w:|Mr. Rockefeller]] (for himself,
[[w:|Ms. Klobuchar]] , and
[[w:|Mr. Blumenthal]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]]  }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To prohibit unauthorized third-party charges on wireline telephone bills, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Fair Telephone Billing Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) For years, telephone users have complained that their wireline telephone bills included unauthorized third-party charges.
:(2) This problem, commonly referred to as“cramming”, first appeared in the 1990s, after wireline telephone companies opened their billing platforms to an array of third-party vendors offering a variety of services.
:(3) Since the 1990s, the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] , the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] , and State attorneys general have brought multiple enforcement actions against dozens of individuals and companies for engaging in cramming.
:(4) An investigation by the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate]] confirmed that cramming is a problem of massive proportions and has affected millions of telephone users, costing them billions of dollars in unauthorized third-party charges over the past decade.
:(5) The [[w:United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Committee]] showed that third-party billing through wireline telephone numbers has largely failed to become a reliable method of payment that consumers and businesses can use to conduct legitimate commerce.
:(6) Telephone companies regularly placed third-party charges on their customers’ telephone bills without their customers’ authorization.
:(7) Many companies engaged in third-party billing were illegitimate and created solely to exploit the weaknesses in the third-party billing platforms established by telephone companies.
:(8) In the last decade, millions of business and residential consumers have transitioned from wireline telephone service to interconnected VoIP service.
:(9) Users of interconnected VoIP service often use the service as the primary telephone line for their residences and businesses.
:(10) Millions more business and residential consumers are expected to migrate to interconnected VoIP service in the coming years as the evolution of the nation’s traditional voice communications networks to IP-based networks continues.
:(11) Users of interconnected VoIP service that have telephone numbers through the service should be protected from the same vulnerabilities that affected third-party billing through wireline telephone numbers.
