{{Center|A BILL}}

 To increase the recruitment and retention of school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists by low-income local educational agencies.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Increasing Student Achievement by Increasing Student Support Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Research shows that socioeconomic status and family background characteristics are highly correlated with educational outcomes, with a concentration of low-performing schools in low-income and under-served communities.
:(2) Teachers cite poor working conditions, student behavior, lack of student motivation, and lack of administrative support as key reasons why they choose to leave the teaching profession.
:(3) Teachers and principals working for low-income local educational agencies are increasingly tasked with addressing not only the academic needs of a child, but also the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of a child that require the services of a school counselor, school social worker, and school psychologist, and these needs often interfere with delivering quality instruction and raising student achievement.
:(4) Only 16 percent of children who need mental health services receive such services. 70 to 80 percent of these children access mental health services at school.
:(5) Students are more likely to seek help when they need it if school-based mental health services are available.
:(6) Rates of abuse and neglect of young children in military families have doubled with the increased military involvement of the United States abroad since October 2002; likewise, adolescents with deployed parents report increased perceptions of uncertainty and loss, role ambiguity, negative changes in mental and behavioral health, and increased relationship conflict, raising concerns about the impact of deployment on military personnel and their families and whether schools that serve a large number of children with deployed parents have sufficient staff and expertise to meet these challenges.
:(7) Children of military families in rural communities are often geographically isolated, and schools that were already experiencing understaffing of school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists face even greater challenges meeting the increased needs of students enduring the stress that comes along with having a deployed parent or parents.
:(8) Schools served by low-income local educational agencies suffer disproportionately from a lack of services, with many schools sharing a single school counselor, school social worker, or school psychologist with neighboring schools.
:(9) Too few school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists per student means that such personnel are often unable to effectively address the needs of students.
:(10) The American School Counselor Association and American Counseling Association recommend having at least 1 school counselor for every 250 students.
:(11) The School Social Work Association of America recommends having at least 1 school social worker for every 400 students.
:(12) The National Association of School Psychologists recommends having at least 1 school psychologist for every 500–700 students.
:(13) Recent research of victimization of children ages 2 to 17 suggests that more than one-half of the children experienced a physical assault in the study year. More than 1 in 4 experienced a property offense, more than 1 in 8 experienced a form of child maltreatment, 1 in 12 experienced a sexual victimization, and more than 1 in 3 had been a witness to violence or experienced another form of indirect victimization. Only 29 percent of the children had no direct or indirect victimization.
:(14) Principals and teachers see signs of trauma-related stress in many students including hostile outbursts, sliding grades, poor test performance, and the inability to pay attention.
:(15) There were more than 423,000 children in foster care in 2009, and studies have revealed these children to have higher rates of placement in special education, dropping out of school, discipline problems, and poorer academic skills than their non-foster care peers. 

=Sec. 3. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to increase the recruitment and retention of school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists by low-income local educational agencies in order to—
:(1) support all students who are at risk of negative educational outcomes;
:(2) improve student achievement, which may be measured by growth in academic achievement on tests required by the applicable State educational agency, persistence rates, graduation rates, and other appropriate measures;
:(3) improve retention of teachers who are highly qualified;
:(4) increase and improve outreach and collaboration between school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists and parents and families served by low-income local educational agencies;
:(5) increase and improve collaboration among teachers, principals, school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists and improve professional development opportunities for teachers and principals in the area of strategies related to improving classroom climate and classroom management; and
:(6) improve working conditions for all school personnel.
