{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of National Public Health Week.    Whereas the week of April 7 through April 13, 2014, is National Public Health Week, and the theme for 2014 is“Public Health: Start Here”;   Whereas since 1995, public health organizations have used National Public Health Week to educate the public, policymakers, and public health professionals about issues that are important to improving the health of the people of the United States;   Whereas the public health system that keeps our communities healthy and safe is changing as technologies advance, public attitudes toward health shift, and more health and safety options become available;   Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and the places where we live, learn, work, and play;   Whereas public health professionals help communities prepare for, withstand, and recover from the impact of natural and man-made disasters;   Whereas according to the Institute of Medicine, despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the United States still ranks below many other economically prosperous countries in life expectancy, infant mortality, low birth weight, and many other indicators of public health;   Whereas studies have shown that small strategic investments in preventive health care could result in significant savings in overall health care costs;   Whereas research suggests that each 10 percent increase in local public health spending contributes to a 6.9 percent decrease in infant deaths, a 3.2 percent decrease in cardiovascular deaths, a 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due to diabetes, and a 1.1 percent decrease in cancer deaths;   Whereas in communities across the country, people are changing the way they care for their health by avoiding tobacco use, eating well, being physically active, and preventing injuries at home and in the workplace; and   Whereas by adequately supporting public health and preventive health care, we can continue to transition from a public health system focused on treating illness to one focused on preventing disease and promoting wellness: Now, therefore, be it
