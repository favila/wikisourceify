{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Recognizing June 30, 2013, as the centennial of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway, which originally spanned 3,389 miles through 13 states, including the great State of Nebraska.Whereas Carl G. Fisher, creator of the Lincoln Highway, believed this project would “stimulate as nothing else could the building of enduring highways everywhere that will not only be a credit to the American people but that will also mean much to American agriculture and American commerce;” Whereas, on October 31, 1913, this great highway became the first national memorial to the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln;Whereas the Lincoln Highway brought economic development, tourism, and adventure to every community it touched;Whereas, on June 22, 2013, hundreds of motorists will participate in the Lincoln Highway Centennial Auto Tour, which will start simultaneously from the bustling streets of New York’s Time Square in the East and from San Francisco’s serene Lincoln Park in the West;Whereas a centennial celebration will take place from June 30, 2013, through July 1, 2013, when Lincoln Highway tour motorists will join at the central meeting place of Kearney, Nebraska, which is precisely 1,733 miles from both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts;Whereas the Lincoln Highway served as a model and an inspiration for President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s grand initiative for a national highway system to connect every person in the United States; andWhereas the Lincoln Highway, more affectionately known as America's Main Street , will continue to be a symbol of Americana and the sense of freedom that comes from driving on the open road: Now, therefore, be it
