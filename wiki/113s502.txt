==={{anchor|ID8c0050eb3a4b4cff841bfe3c25f15c41}}Sec. 1841. Findings===

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Investments in children and early childhood development education should be a national priority.
:(2) State-funded preschool is the most rapidly expanding segment of the United States educational system, but in many States a lack of stable funding poses an enormous threat to the provision or continuation of high-quality preschool.
:(3) Researchers, educators, and economists have long noted an achievement gap for low-income and minority students as compared to their more advantaged peers that is often already evident when children enter school for the first time.
:(4) One study showed that before entering kindergarten, the average cognitive scores of preschool-age children in the highest socioeconomic group are 60 percent above the average scores of preschool-age children in the lowest socioeconomic group.
:(5) For low-income preschoolers, research shows that high-quality early education and development is vital to closing the achievement gap between them and their more advantaged peers.
:(6) Numerous studies have shown that high-quality preschool programs—
::(A) improve a number of specific life outcomes for children; and
::(B) are cost-effective.
:(7) The provision of high-quality prekindergarten is a cost-effective investment for children and for the Nation. Research shows that for every $1 invested in high-quality early childhood programs, taxpayers save up to $7 in crime, welfare, remedial and special education, and other costs.
:(8) High-quality early education increases academic success for schoolchildren who received that education by—
::(A) improving skills in areas such as following directions and problem solving;
::(B) improving students' performance on standardized tests;
::(C) reducing grade repetition;
::(D) reducing the number of students placed in special education; and
::(E) increasing secondary school graduation rates.
:(9) High-quality early education promotes responsible behavior by teens and adults who received that education by—
::(A) reducing crime, delinquency, and unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and drug use;
::(B) lowering rates of teen pregnancy;
::(C) leading to greater employment and higher wages for adults; and
::(D) contributing to more stable families.
:(10) High-quality prekindergarten programs prepare children to—
::(A) succeed in school;
::(B) achieve higher levels of education; and
::(C) become citizens who—
:::(i) earn more in adulthood;
:::(ii) compete in the global economy; and
:::(iii) contribute to our national prosperity.
:(11) The gap in developmental progress prior to preschool is significant for thousands of young children, and needs to be addressed in order to have a strong foundation for children’s progress in preschool and later years.
