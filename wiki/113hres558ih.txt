Under the revisions promulgated by the [[w:United States House Committee on House Administration|Committee on House Administration]]undersubsection (a), a Members’ Representational Allowance may be used for the payment of the costs of first-class airline accommodations for domestic travel if the Member whose Allowance will be used for such payment certifies in writing to the [[w:United States House Committee on House Administration|Committee]]that any of the following applies:
:(1) The use of first-class accommodations is necessary to accommodate a medical disability or other special need, as demonstrated by such documentation as the [[w:United States House Committee on House Administration|Committee]]may require.

:(3) The use of first-class accommodations is necessary because of exceptional security circumstances or other exceptional circumstances.
:(4) The use of first-class accommodations will result in an overall cost savings by avoiding additional subsistence costs, overtime, or lost productive time while awaiting coach-class accommodations.
