{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate on the importance of the United States-India strategic partnership and the continued deepening of bilateral ties with India.    Whereas the United States-India relationship is built on mutual respect for common values, including democracy, the rule of law, a market economy, and ethnic and religious diversity, and bolstered by strong people-to-people ties, including a 3,000,000-strong Indian American diaspora;   Whereas the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]places tremendous value on the relationship with India, and the bipartisan Senate India Caucus comprises 40 Senators and is the largest bilateral caucus in the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]];   Whereas the United States and India have a unique opportunity, in the early days of the new administration in India, to refresh the United States-India relationship and work cooperatively to make progress that will benefit both of our countries in a broad range of areas, including education, skills development, infrastructure, and energy;   Whereas a strong economic partnership between India and the United States requires a mutual respect for innovation;   Whereas an investment environment that fosters continued research and development and the bilateral relationship between the United States and India has resulted in almost $100,000,000,000 in trade of goods and services in 2013;   Whereas the United States-India relationship is vital to promoting stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in the 21st century;   Whereas defense and security ties have led to nearly $10,000,000,000 in defense trade, and the United States-India Defense Trade and Technology Initiative has facilitated greater cooperation on joint development of defense platforms;   Whereas counterterrorism cooperation is a growing and important aspect of the partnership given the terrorist threats faced by both countries, including from groups such as al Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba;   Whereas the United States values India’s role as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region and promoter of regional stability and maritime security in the Asian Pacific region; and   Whereas India is a close partner of the United States in Afghanistan, has committed over $2,000,000,000 in development assistance, and shares the United States goal of a stable, democratic, and prosperous Afghanistan; Now, therefore, be it
