=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—

::(B) rapid alert dissemination;
::(C) an improved ability to notify remote locations; and
::(D) the ability to geographically target and deliver alerts and warnings through multiple communication modes;
:(3) there is a need to test the viability of delivering messages through diverse communications modes to effectively alert and warn the public;
:(4) there is a need to modernize and improve the ability of the Federal Government to provide residents of the United States with timely and effective warnings; and
:(5) although significant Federal integration efforts are underway, the aggregation, dissemination, and reporting system necessary for effective public alert and warning will require an integrated national network for reliable, secure, and authentic dissemination of emergency alerts and warnings by Federal, State, local, and tribal entities that are authorized to issue alerts to the public.
