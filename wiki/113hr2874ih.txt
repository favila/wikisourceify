=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security, rooted in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (SCR 1325) and its four follow-up resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009), and 1960 (2010) seeks to address the disproportionate impact of modern warfare on civilians, particularly women and girls, and the necessity of substantively including“women as equal partners in preventing conflict and building peace in countries threatened and affected by war, violence, and insecurity in all efforts to promote peace and security.”.
:(2) Fundamental to the affirmations described in paragraph (1) is the full and equal participation of women as decisionmakers, planners, implementers, and beneficiaries in all efforts to achieve solutions for just conflict resolution, lasting stability, and inclusive democratic governance, including in—
::(A) conflict prevention;
::(B) mediation, transition processes, and peace and security negotiations;
::(C) peacekeeping and peace-building efforts;
::(D) humanitarian response; and
::(E) post-conflict reconstruction and governance.
:(3) The United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security, issued in December 2011—
::(A) builds upon the goals for gender integration articulated in—
:::(i) the United States 2006 National Security Strategy:“No nation can be free if half its population is oppressed and denied fundamental rights. We affirm the inherent dignity and worth of women, and support vigorously their full participation in all aspects of society.”;
:::(ii) the United States May 2010 National Security Strategy:“Experience shows that countries are more peaceful and prosperous when women are accorded full and equal rights and opportunity. When those rights and opportunities are denied countries often lag behind.”; and
:::(iii) the 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review:“The protection and empowerment of women and girls is key to the foreign policy and security of the United States.”; and
::(B) asserts that“evidence from around the world and across cultures shows that integrating women and gender considerations into peace-building processes helps promote democratic governance and long-term stability”.
:(4) As directed by the Executive Order,“State, DoD, and USAID will designate one or more officers, as appropriate, as responsible for coordination and implementation, and will supplement this Plan, by submitting to the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor agency-specific Women, Peace and Security implementation plans. These implementation plans will establish a full range of time-bound, measurable, and resourced actions State, DoD, and USAID will take to realize their commitments, and will include meaningful strategies for monitoring implementation and evaluating results.”.
:(5) On April 5, 2012, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Secretary of Defense Memorandum directing the Department to incorporate the concepts from the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security into programs, policies and daily activities, stating“that the goal of the National Action Plan is critical to national security;”and in June 2012, introduced the Department of Defense Implementation Guide for the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security to integrate the objectives of the United States National Action Plan into the“strategic, operational, and tactical environment and aims”of the United States military.
:(6) In March 2012, the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) released a new, agency-wide Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy, the first such policy since 1982. According to this policy,“Gender equality and female empowerment are core development objectives, fundamental for the realization of human rights and key to effective and sustainable development outcomes. No society can develop successfully without providing equitable opportunities, resources, and life prospects for males and females so that they can shape their own lives and contribute to their families and communities.”.
:(7) In August 2012, the Department of State Implementation of the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security was introduced. The plan states,“the Department recognizes that promoting women’s participation in conflict prevention, management and resolution, as well as in post-conflict relief and recovery, advances core U.S. national interests of peace, national security, economic and social development and international cooperation.”.
:(8) In August 2012, the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) introduced its Implementation of the United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security asserting,“Ensuring the meaningful participation and protection of women and girls affected by crisis and conflict is critical to building lasting peace and achieving long-term development objectives.”.
:(9) During preparations for United States withdrawal of security forces in Afghanistan by 2014, and upcoming Afghan elections, it is critical to ensure women’s rights are not sacrificed and further that women’s security and ability to move freely throughout the country are recognized as indicators of the transition’s success.
:(10) In the Democratic Republic of Congo, ongoing impunity for violations of human rights, particularly women’s human rights, continues to undermine all efforts to bring lasting peace to the country and the region.
:(11) Women and girls on the forefronts of the Arab uprising—from Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Syria—are systematically excluded from political processes in the new emerging democratic governments, and reports of gender-based violent attacks, including sexual violence, by police and security forces are frequent.
