{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the mission and goals of 2014 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, which include increasing public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of, and services available to assist, victims and survivors of crime in the United States.    Whereas in 2011, there were approximately 6,000,000 victims and survivors of violent crime and more than 17,000,000 victims and survivors of property crime in the United States;   Whereas according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, nonfatal violent crime in the United States increased by 17 percent and property crime in the United States increased by 11 percent between 2010 and 2011;   Whereas according to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation]],“law enforcement agencies throughout the nation reported an increase of 1.9 percent in the number of violent crimes brought to their attention for the first 6 months of 2012 when compared with figures reported for the same time in 2011”;   Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on individuals, families, schools, and communities by protecting the rights of crime victims and survivors and ensuring that resources and services are available to help rebuild the lives of such victims and survivors;   Whereas despite impressive accomplishments between 1974 and 2014 in increasing the rights of, and services available to, crime victims and survivors, and the families of such victims and survivors, many challenges remain to ensure that all crime victims and survivors, and the families of such victims and survivors, are— 
:(1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect; 
:(2) offered support and services regardless of whether such victims and survivors report crimes committed against them; and 
:(3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, juvenile, Federal, tribal, and civil justice systems in the United States when such victims and survivors report crimes;   Whereas crime victims and survivors in the United States, and the families of such victims and survivors, need and deserve support and assistance to help cope with the often devastating consequences of crime;   Whereas 2014 marks the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the  Victims of Crime Act of 1984 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/10601 42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.])(referred to in this preamble as“VOCA”), which is the hallmark of the commitment of the Federal Government to supporting rights and services for victims and survivors of all types of crime;   Whereas VOCA established the Crime Victims Fund, which is paid for by criminal fines and penalties, rather than by taxpayer dollars;   Whereas the Crime Victims Fund has collected more than $20,400,000,000 from criminals to be used exclusively to help victims and survivors of crime;   Whereas during each year between 1984 and 2014, communities across the United States have joined [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]in commemorating National Crime Victims' Rights Week to celebrate a shared vision of a comprehensive and collaborative response that identifies and addresses the many needs of crime victims and survivors, and the families of such victims and survivors;   Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]agree on the need for a renewed commitment to serving all victims and survivors of crime in the 21st century;   Whereas the theme of 2014 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, celebrated during the week of April 6 through April 12, 2014, is“30 Years: Restoring the Balance of Justice”and highlights the many challenges that confront crime-victim assistance, justice, and public safety; and   Whereas the people of the United States recognize and appreciate the continued importance of— 
:(1) promoting the rights of, and services for, crime victims and survivors; and 
:(2) honoring crime victims and survivors and individuals who provide services for such victims and survivors: Now, therefore, be it

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]—
:(1) supports the mission and goals of 2014 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, which include increasing individual and public awareness of—
::(A) the impact of crime on victims and survivors, and the families of such victims and survivors;
::(B) the challenges to achieving justice for victims and survivors of crime, and the families of such victims and survivors; and
::(C) the many solutions to meet such challenges;
:(2) recognizes that crime victims and survivors, and the families of such victims and survivors, should be treated with dignity, fairness, and respect; and
:(3) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the  Victims of Crime Act of 1984 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/10601 42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.]).
