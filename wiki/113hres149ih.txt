{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing support for designation of April as Parkinson’s Awareness Month.Whereas Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive, neurological disease and is the second most common neurological disease in the United States;Whereas there is inadequate comprehensive data on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson’s disease;Whereas it is estimated that the disease affects 500,000 to 1,500,000 people in the United States and the prevalence will more than double by 2040;Whereas there are millions of people in the United States who are caregivers, family members, and friends greatly impacted by Parkinson’s disease every day;Whereas it is estimated that the economic burden of Parkinson’s disease is $14,400,000,000 including indirect costs to patients and family members of $6,300,000,000 each year;Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson’s disease is a combination of genetic and environmental factors, the exact cause and progression of the disease is still unknown;Whereas there is no objective test or biomarker for Parkinson’s disease, and the rate of misdiagnosis can be high;Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease vary from person to person and include tremors, slowness of movement, difficulty with balance, swallowing, chewing, speaking, rigidity, cognitive impairment, dementia, mood disorders (such as depression and anxiety) constipation, skin problems, and sleep difficulties;Whereas there is no cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt the progression of Parkinson’s disease;Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson’s disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with dose-limiting side effects, and ultimately lose their effectiveness, leaving the person unable to move, speak, or swallow;Whereas increased education and research are needed to find more effective treatments with fewer side effects and, ultimately, an effective treatment or cure for Parkinson’s disease; andWhereas April would be an appropriate month to designate as Parkinson’s Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
