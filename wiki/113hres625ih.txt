{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Honoring Greyhound Lines, Inc., of Dallas, TX on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.    Whereas the company that became Greyhound Lines, Inc., was started in 1914 by a Swedish immigrant, Carl Eric Wickman, who began by transporting miners from Hibbing to Alice, Minnesota, in a 7-passenger“Hupmobile”for 15 cents;   Whereas in ensuing decades, Greyhound pioneered many bus industry innovations including the“Super Coach”in 1936 (the first bus with an all-metal body and rear-mounted engine), the fluted aluminum“Silversides”with air conditioning and diesel engines in 1940 (the most iconic Greyhound bus), the two-level“Scenicruiser”with onboard restrooms and under-floor baggage and express compartments in 1954;   Whereas Greyhound played a crucial role in many historical events, including transporting troops from coast to coast in World War II and carrying Freedom Riders through the Deep South to protest State-sponsored segregation in interstate transportation facilities;   Whereas Greyhound is the only nationwide intercity bus transportation company in the United States serving, along with its interline partners, over 2700 communities in all 48 continental States, and providing the only form of intercity public transportation in many of those communities;   Whereas Greyhound efficiently operates a complex network of services extending from Canada to Mexico, including services in both of those countries;   Whereas Greyhound has been a leader in safety innovations including developing and installing on all its new buses starting in 2009 radically redesigned new bus seats that provide the protection of lap/shoulder safety belts while retaining the benefits of compartmentalization;   Whereas Greyhound continues to provide innovative new services such as the Greyhound Express and BoltBus point-to-point services while retaining its full nationwide network and provides all of its services in state-of-the-art, 50-passenger motorcoaches with amenities such as expanded leg room, WiFi and electric plug-ins; and   Whereas Greyhound continues to do what Carl Wickman began 100 years ago, that is, providing affordable, safe, comfortable, and reliable intercity transportation to all members of the traveling public: Now, therefore, be it
