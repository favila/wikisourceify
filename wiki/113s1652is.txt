[[w:|Mr. Schatz]] (for himself,
[[w:|Mr. Alexander]] , and
[[w:|Mr. Coats]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to provide guidance on utility energy service contracts used by Federal agencies, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Utility Energy Service Contracts Improvement Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the Federal Government is the largest consumer of energy in the United States;
:(2) Federal agencies are expected to meet, by law, Executive order, and mandate, stringent energy efficiency and conservation targets;
:(3) the utility energy service contract (referred to in this section as “UESC” ) was developed to provide Federal agencies an effective means to implement energy efficiency, renewable energy and water efficiency projects, and has been used successfully to invest nearly $2,700,000,000 in property at Federal facilities;
:(4) the [[w:General Services Administration|General Services Administration]] , which manages more than 9,600 Federal properties and is the lead agency for procuring utility services for the Federal Government, has determined that UESCs may extend beyond a 10-year period under the law;
:(5) the Federal Energy Management Program, which oversees the UESC program and is a principal office guiding agencies to use funding more effectively in meeting Federal and agency-specific energy and resource management objectives, has determined that UESCs may extend beyond a 10-year period under the law;
:(6) extensive precedent exists for Federal agencies to contract for energy saving services using contracts with term limits of more than 10 years but not to exceed 25 years;
:(7) a number of Federal agencies, contrary to congressional intent, have sought to limit UESC term limits to periods of less than 10 years; and
:(8) greater flexibility with UESCs will help reduce the operational cost of Federal agencies, ultimately saving money for taxpayers.

=Sec. 3. Utility energy service contracts=

 Part 3 of title V of the National Energy Conservation Policy Actis amended by adding after section 553( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/8259b 42 U.S.C. 8259b] )the following:

<blockquote>
