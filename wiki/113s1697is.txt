:(4) in 2011, there were 11,000,000 infants and toddlers living in the United States and 49 percent of these children came from low-income families living with incomes at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines;
:(5) the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program was authorized by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to facilitate collaboration and partnership at the Federal, State, and community levels to improve health and development outcomes for at-risk children, including those from low-income families, through evidence-based home visiting programs;
:(6) MIECHV is an evidence-based policy initiative and its authorizing legislation requires that at least 75 percent of funds dedicated to the program must support programs to implement evidence-based home visiting models, which includes the home-based model of Early Head Start; and
:(7)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] should continue to provide resources to MIECHV to support the work of States to help at-risk families voluntarily receive home visits from nurses and social workers to—
::(A) promote maternal, infant, and child health;
::(B) improve school readiness and achievement;
::(C) prevent potential child abuse or neglect and injuries;
