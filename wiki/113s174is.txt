[[w:|Mr. Blumenthal]] (for himself,

{{Center|A BILL}}

 To appropriately restrict sales of ammunition.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Ammunition Background Check Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Under current Federal law, it is illegal to sell firearms or ammunition to certain individuals, including felons, fugitives, drug addicts, and those deemed“mentally defective”or committed to a mental institution.
:(2) There is no requirement under Federal law that sellers of ammunition conduct a background check to determine whether potential purchasers are in fact prohibited by law from buying ammunition.
:(3) By contrast, under current Federal law, licensed sellers of firearms are required by law to conduct an instant background check using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System of the Justice Department.
:(4) Over the last decade, there have been over 100,000,000 background checks conducted under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with respect to firearms sales, resulting in the blocking of more than 1,500,000 sales of firearms to felons, fugitives, drug addicts, and the mentally ill, among others.
:(5) The vast majority of instant background checks on firearms purchases occur in an average of 30 seconds, at minimal inconvenience to firearms sellers and law-abiding purchasers.
:(6) The requirement of background checks for ammunition purchases would pose a minimal inconvenience to ammunition sellers and law-abiding purchasers, and would help reduce gun-related violence.
:(7) Current Federal law includes a variety of other provisions regulating the sale of firearms, including limits on interstate gun sales and recordkeeping requirements designed to assist in criminal investigations, that do not apply to sales of ammunition.
:(8) Sales of ammunition should be held to similar requirements as sales of firearms. 

=Sec. 3. Background checks=

::(1) On and after the date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of the  Ammunition Background Check Act of 2013  , no person who is licensed under this chapter shall transfer ammunition to any other person who is not licensed under this chapter, unless—

:::(B) 
::::(i) the system provides the licensee with a unique identification number; or
