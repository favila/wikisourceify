[[w:|Ms. Collins]] (for herself,
[[w:|Mrs. McCaskill]] , and
[[w:|Mr. Manchin]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To improve the management of the Job Corps program, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “ Securing Job Corps Centers Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor’s]] management of the Job Corps program has recently suffered from poor budgeting and financial management. The [[w:|Office of Inspector General of the Department of Labor]] found that the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department]] had projected costs erroneously and managerial factors exacerbated the resulting budget shortfalls.
:(2) For nearly 50 years, the Job Corps program was overseen by a single individual appointed to a position in the Senior Executive Service. The management structure for the program has expanded to include 3 positions in the Senior Executive Service. This expansion has not contributed to better management of the program but has created uncertainty about roles and responsibilities, according to the May 31, 2013, report by the [[w:|Office of Inspector General]] .
:(3) The [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] has not been sufficiently transparent with [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] regarding policies that significantly affect constituents, particularly decisions to suspend enrollments or reduce the number of enrollees the Job Corps program serves.
:(4) An advisory board of Job Corps operational experts can assist the new leadership of the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] as the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department]] —
::(A) addresses the structural challenges the Job Corps program faces in its administration; and
::(B) returns the program to the administrative and operational efficiency that characterized the program's first 50 years.

==(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) local Job Corps center operational experts should play an important role in ensuring the effective management by the Secretary of the Job Corps program, by informing the [[w:|Office of Job Corps]] on the impact Federal decisions may have on Job Corps campuses;
:(2) the Job Corps program continues to produce results as the economy of the United States recovers and unemployment remains high, as more than 85 percent of Job Corps graduates obtain a job, enroll in higher education, or enlist in the military upon completion; and
:(3) the 125 Job Corps center campuses, which includes locations in nearly every State, have compiled an impressive record of preparing at-risk youth for the workforce or higher education, and in nearly 50 years, more than 3,000,000 youth have obtained, through the Job Corps program, the job and social skills needed to start a career or obtain further educational credentials.
