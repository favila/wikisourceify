=Sec. 2. Findings; sense of Congress=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) The mobile health and mobile application economy was created in the United States and is now being exported globally, with the market expected to exceed $26,000,000,000 by 2017.
:(2) The United States mobile application economy is responsible for nearly 500,000 new jobs in the United States.
:(3) Consumer health information technologies, including smart phones and tablets, have the potential to transform health care delivery through reduced systemic costs, improved patient safety, and better clinical outcomes.
:(4) Clinical and health software innovation cycles evolve and move faster than the existing regulatory approval processes.
:(5) Consumers and innovators need a new risk-based framework for the oversight of clinical and health software that improves on the framework of the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]].
:(6) A working group convened jointly by the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]], the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]], and the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]]identified in a report that there are several major barriers to the effective regulation of health information technology that cannot be alleviated without changes to existing law.

==(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]must intervene to facilitate interagency coordination across regulators that focuses agency efforts on fostering health information technology and mobile health innovation while better protecting patient safety, improving health care, and creating jobs in the United States;
:(2) the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]and the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]should work together to develop and enact legislation that establishes a risk-based regulatory framework for such clinical software and health software that reduces regulatory burdens, fosters innovation, and, most importantly, improves patient safety;
:(3) The [[w:National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology]]should be the Federal agency that has oversight over technical standards used by clinical software; and
:(4) The [[w:National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology]], in collaboration with the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]], the National Patient Safety Foundation, and the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]], should work on next steps, beyond current oversight efforts, regarding health information technology, such as collaborating with nongovernmental entities to develop certification processes and to promote best practice standards.

::(3) The terms clinical software and health software do not include software—
:::(A) that is intended to interpret patient-specific device data and directly diagnose a patient or user without the intervention of a health care provider;
