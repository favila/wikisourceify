{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to replace the mortgage interest deduction with a nonrefundable credit for indebtedness secured by a residence, to provide affordable housing to extremely low-income families, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Common Sense Housing Investment Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Congressional findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Two principal Federal housing goals are to increase the rate of home ownership and make rental housing affordable for low-income families and individuals.
:(2) Much more progress has been achieved on the first goal than on the second goal.
:(3) The Federal Government devotes more than three times the amount of budgetary resources to supporting home ownership than it devotes to making affordable rental housing available.
:(4) The burden of housing costs is more pronounced among renters than among owners.
:(5) There is a shortage of more than 7 million homes affordable to families in the bottom 20 percent of income, meaning that there are only 30 affordable units for every 100 families.
:(6) Only one in four families that qualify for rental housing assistance receives benefits.
:(7) Housing assistance waiting lists can be 10 years long and in many communities are closed.
:(8) The shortage of rental homes that are affordable for extremely low-income households to be the principal cause of homelessness in the United States.
:(9) Public housing facilities in the United States have more than $26 billion in deferred maintenance after decades of neglect which results in a loss of 10,000 units each year.
:(10) The low-income housing tax credit successfully provides 100,000 units of affordable housing every year.
:(11) Every tax reform commission has recommended capping the mortgage interest deduction and converting it to a fairer and simpler credit.
:(12) More than 75 percent of the value of the mortgage interest deduction inures to the benefit of the top 20 percent of earners.
:(13) Fewer than half of tax filers with a home mortgage claim the mortgage interest deduction.
:(14) Only 9 percent of rural tax filers claim the mortgage interest deduction.
:(15) Ninety-six percent of homes sold between 2005 and 2011 sold for less than $500,000.
:(16) A better approach that provides equitable benefits for families who buy homes, enables more low- and moderate-income homeowners to receive a benefit, and invests in affordable rental housing to assist those who used to be homeless or who have extremely or very low incomes is needed to strengthen families and communities.
