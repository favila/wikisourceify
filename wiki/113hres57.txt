{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that in order to continue aggressive growth in the Nation’s telecommunications and technology industries, the United States Government should“Get Out of the Way and Stay Out of the Way”.Whereas the technology and communications industries in the United States have historically been some of the most competitive in the world and devoid of burdensome Government regulations;Whereas the United States has over 85,000,000 wireline broadband connections;Whereas wireless auctions are the reason the United States has over 235,000,000 wireless broadband connections;Whereas public-private partnerships, like those piloted by organizations such as Connected Nation, have raised broadband subscription rates, especially in rural areas, by increasing both broadband supply and demand without having to rely on regulation;Whereas deregulatory policies and free-market competition consistently yield a higher rate of economic growth, a greater standard of living for all Americans, and an enhanced capacity for the United States to be competitive in the global marketplace;Whereas the digital age not only expands an individual's reach and ability to connect with family and friends, provides new and exciting educational opportunities, and expands a growing global economy, while simultaneously exposing an individual to a myriad of new threats such as identity theft and other methods of online victimization, and resulting in the increase of attempted criminal cyber attacks on businesses and communications networks; andWhereas we should continually strive to advance this rapidly growing source of social and economic benefit to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it
