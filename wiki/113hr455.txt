{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
		  1965 to direct certain coeducational elementary and secondary schools to make
		  available information on equality in school athletic programs, and for other
		  purposes.

={{anchor|H7CB6CF7815F74A93830BBCB625E7BDC7}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the
			 “High School Data Transparency Act of
			 2013”.

={{anchor|H881ABA101A5F4A6B8896759FA9ACF02F}}Sec. 2. Findings and
			 purposes=



=={{anchor|HE5D38033D4634AD0A705A24619DDC1C1}}(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Participation in
			 sports teaches youth critical life skills and has a significant positive impact
			 on all areas of their lives, especially for girls.
:(2) Girls who participate in sports have higher
			 levels of confidence and self-esteem, lower levels of depression, are less
			 likely to be suicidal, are more likely to have a positive body image than
			 female non-athletes, and are half as likely to experience an unintended
			 pregnancy as compared to female non-athletes. Girls who participate in sports
			 have higher graduation rates, receive better grades, and are less likely to
			 smoke or use illegal drugs.
:(3) Sports participation effectively combats
			 obesity, which is particularly significant given that one in six girls are
			 obese or overweight and African-Americans and Hispanic girls face even greater
			 risks.
:(4) Despite advances
			 in athletic opportunities for women and girls since the passage of title IX of
			 the Education Amendments of 1972, discrimination still limits athletic
			 opportunities for females in interscholastic and intercollegiate athletics.
			 Girls comprise 49 percent of the high school population, but receive only 41
			 percent of all interscholastic athletic participation opportunities nationwide.
			 This translates into 1,300,000 fewer opportunities to play high school sports
			 for girls than for boys. These lost participation opportunities also result in
			 the loss of athletic scholarships that make it possible for many girls and
			 young women to attend college.
:(5) There is ample
			 evidence that girls’ teams often receive inferior benefits and services when
			 they do play, in areas such as overall budgets; travel; equipment; uniforms;
			 facilities, including locker rooms, fields, and practice and competitive
			 facilities; training and medical services; publicity; access to coaches; and
			 scheduling of practices, games, and sports seasons.
:(6) Without
			 information about how athletic opportunities and benefits are being allocated
			 at the elementary and secondary school levels, students may be deprived of
			 opportunities to play sports and to receive athletic scholarships to attend
			 college.
:(7) Students, parents,
			 and schools should be aware of the athletic opportunities and benefits
			 available to male and female students so that they can work to enhance athletic
			 opportunities for all and address any inequities.

=={{anchor|HB0B93DC0D00C481085E10CD40994A9D8}}(b) Purposes– ==

The
			 purposes of this Act are as follows:
:(1) To ensure that information about the
			 allocation of athletic opportunities and benefits at the elementary and
			 secondary school levels is available to all students.
:(2) To promote equal
			 opportunities for both boys and girls to engage in school-sponsored
			 athletics.
:(3) To provide boys
			 and girls with equal access to the physical, psychological, health and other
			 benefits that result from playing sports.

			 statistics on equality in athletic programs=
