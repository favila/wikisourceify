{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to childhood stroke and recognizing May 2014 as“National Pediatric Stroke Awareness Month”.    Whereas a stroke, also known as cerebrovascular disease, is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in the artery or a burst of the artery;   Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated;   Whereas a stroke occurs in approximately 1 out of every 3,500 live births, and 4.6 out of 100,000 children ages 19 and under experience a stroke each year;   Whereas a stroke can occur before birth;   Whereas stroke is among the top 12 causes of death for children between the ages of 1 and 14 in the United States;   Whereas 20 to 40 percent of children who have suffered a stroke die as a result;   Whereas a stroke recurs within 5 years in 10 percent of children who have had an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke;   Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke before the age of 1 is the highest out of all child age groups;   Whereas there are no approved therapies for the treatment of acute stroke in infants and children;   Whereas approximately 60 percent of infants and children who have a pediatric stroke will have serious, permanent neurological disabilities, including paralysis, seizures, speech and vision problems, and attention, learning, and behavioral difficulties;   Whereas such disabilities may require ongoing physical therapy and surgeries;   Whereas the permanent health concerns of and treatments for strokes that occur during childhood and young adulthood have considerable impacts on children, families, and society;   Whereas more information is necessary regarding the cause, treatment, and prevention of pediatric strokes;   Whereas medical research is the only means by which the people of the United States can identify and develop effective treatment and prevention strategies for pediatric strokes; and   Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric strokes greatly improves the chances that an affected child will recover and not experience a recurrence of a stroke: Now, therefore, be it
