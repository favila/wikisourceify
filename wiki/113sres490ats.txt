{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry.    Whereas, on September 20, 1962, the 87thCongress granted consent to the State of Delaware and the State of New Jersey to enter into a compact to establish the Delaware River and Bay Authority (referred to in this preamble as the“DRBA”) for the development of the area in both States bordering the Delaware River and Bay;   Whereas the pressures of increasing amounts of traffic, a growing population, and greater industrialization indicated the need for closer cooperation between the 2 States in order to advance their economic development and to improve crossings and transportation between the 2 States;   Whereas the Delaware River and Bay Authority was organized on February 6, 1963, to construct and operate transportation crossings between the 2 States and its first line of business was to update earlier feasibility studies for a ferry service connecting southern New Jersey and southern Delaware;   Whereas DRBA Commissioners immediately resolved, in April 1963, to establish the Cape May-Lewes Ferry at the earliest possible date following the release of the updated feasibility study;   Whereas, on July 1, 1964, the very first vessel departed the Lewes, Delaware terminal at 6:47 a.m., carrying 8 vehicles and 15 passengers;   Whereas the Cape May-Lewes Ferry has served as a major transportation link in the crowded Northeast corridor, connecting north-south traffic from Boston and New York City to Washington, D.C. and Florida;   Whereas the 85 minute, 17 mile journey across the Delaware Bay offers an efficient way to cut miles off a road trip;   Whereas the Cape May-Lewes Ferry has evolved over the past 50 years from strictly a mode of transportation to one that includes tourism and recreational opportunities;   Whereas the Cape May-Lewes Ferry offers foot passenger shuttle service to destinations in Delaware and New Jersey for a variety of commercial and recreational activities on the other side of the Delaware Bay;   Whereas both bird watchers and bicyclists use the Cape May-Lewes Ferry to access the various and numerous trails on both sides of the Delaware Bay;   Whereas the Cape May-Lewes Ferry terminals will host festivals to celebrate the highly anticipated 50thAnniversary of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry on June 28, 2014, in Cape May and June 29, 2014, in Lewes;   Whereas the Cape May-Lewes Ferry employs more than 130 full-time personnel and an additional 330 seasonal workers, adding significantly to the economies on both sides of the Delaware Bay;   Whereas the Cape May-Lewes Ferry operates year-round and has carried more than 43 million passengers and 14 million vehicles since the inception of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry in 1964;   Whereas the DRBA continues to invest its resources to improve the services and infrastructure of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, including a renovated ferry fleet and new passenger terminal facilities; and   Whereas the Cape May-Lewes Ferry remains an important transportation link, as a waterway continuation of United States Route 9 between the State of Delaware and the State of New Jersey: Now, therefore, be it
