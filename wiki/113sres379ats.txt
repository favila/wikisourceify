{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Congratulating the Pennsylvania State University IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (“THON”) on its continued success in support of the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital.    Whereas the Pennsylvania State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (referred to in this preamble as“THON”) is the largest student-run philanthropy in the world, with 711 dancers, more than 375 supporting organizations, and more than 15,000 volunteers involved in the annual event;   Whereas student volunteers at the Pennsylvania State University annually collect money and dance for 46 hours straight at the Bryce Jordan Center as part of THON, bringing energy and excitement to the campus for THON's mission to conquer cancer and raise awareness about the disease;   Whereas all THON activities support the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, which funds cancer research and provides financial and emotional support to pediatric cancer patients and their families;   Whereas in each year since 1977, when the 2 organizations first became affiliated, THON has been the single largest donor to the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital;   Whereas THON has raised more than $113,000,000 in total for the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital;   Whereas in 2014, THON set a new fundraising record of $13,343,517.33, besting the previous record of $12,374,034.46, which was set in 2013;   Whereas THON has helped more than 3,300 families through the Four Diamonds Fund, is helping to build a new Pediatric Cancer Pavilion at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, and has supported life-saving pediatric cancer research that has increased the survival rates for some pediatric cancers to nearly 90 percent; and   Whereas THON has inspired similar events and organizations across the United States, including at high schools and institutions of higher education, and continues to encourage students across the United States to volunteer and stay involved in great charitable causes in their community: Now, therefore, be it
