   Section 1421(d) of the Safe Drinking Water Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300h 42 U.S.C. 300h(d)] )is amended by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:

<blockquote> 

===(1) Underground injection– ===



====(A) In general– ====

The term underground injection means the subsurface emplacement of fluids by well injection.

====(B) Inclusion– ====

The term underground injection includes the underground injection of fluids or propping agents pursuant to hydraulic fracturing operations relating to oil or natural gas production activities.

   Section 1422 of the Safe Drinking Water Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300h–1 42 U.S.C. 300h–1] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 

===(f) Hydraulic fracturing operations– ===



====(1) In general– ====

Consistent with such regulations as the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]may prescribe, a State may seek primary enforcement responsibility for hydraulic fracturing operations for oil and natural gas without seeking to assume primary enforcement responsibility for other types of underground injection control wells, including underground injection control wells that inject brine or other fluids that are brought to the surface in connection with oil and natural gas production or any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas.

====(2) Administration– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

  Paragraph (1) shall not apply until the date that is 1 year after the date on which the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]publishes in the Federal Register any regulations promulgated under that paragraph.

:(i) before the commencement of any hydraulic fracturing operations at any lease area or a portion of a lease area, a list of chemicals and proppants intended for use in any underground injection during the operations (including identification of the chemical constituents of mixtures, Chemical Abstracts Service numbers for each chemical and constituent, material safety data sheets if available, and the anticipated amount of each chemical to be used); and
:(ii) after the completion of hydraulic fracturing operations described in clause (i), the list of chemicals and proppants used in each underground injection during the operations (including identification of the chemical constituents of mixtures, Chemical Abstracts Service numbers for each chemical and constituent, material safety data sheets if available, and the amount of each chemical used).
