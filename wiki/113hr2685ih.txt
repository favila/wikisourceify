=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Smart Grid Advancement Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Administrator– ==

The term Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

==(2) Applicable baseline– ==

The term applicable baseline means the average of the highest three annual peak demands a load-serving entity has experienced during the 5 years immediately prior to the date of enactment of this Act.

==(3) Commission– ==

The term Commission means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .

==(4) Load-serving entity– ==

The term load-serving entity means an entity that provides electricity directly to retail consumers with the responsibility to assure power quality and reliability, including such entities that are investor-owned, publicly owned, owned by rural electric cooperatives, or other entities.

==(5) Peak demand– ==

The term peak demand means the highest point of electricity demand, net of any distributed electricity generation or storage from sources on the load-serving entity’s customers’ premises, during any hour on the system of a load-serving entity during a calendar year, expressed in mega­watts (MW), or more than one such high point as a function of seasonal demand changes.

==(6) Peak demand reduction– ==

The term peak demand reduction means the reduction in annual peak demand as compared to a previous baseline year or period, expressed in megawatts (MW), whether accomplished by—
:(A) diminishing the end-use requirements for electricity;
:(B) use of locally stored energy or generated electricity to meet those requirements from distributed resources on the load-serving entity’s customers’ premises and without use of high-voltage transmission; or
:(C) energy savings from efficient operation of the distribution grid resulting from the use of a Smart Grid.

==(7) Peak demand reduction plan– ==

The term peak demand reduction plan means a plan developed by or for a load-serving entity that it will implement to meet its peak demand reduction goals.

==(8) Peak period– ==

The term peak period means the time period on the system of a load-serving entity relative to peak demand that may warrant special measures or electricity resources to maintain system reliability while meeting peak demand.

==(9) Secretary– ==

The term Secretary means the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]of Energy.

==(10) Smart Grid– ==

The term Smart Grid has the meaning provided by  section 1301 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17381 42 U.S.C. 17381] ). 

=Sec. 3. Assessment of Smart Grid cost effectiveness in products=



==(a) Assessment– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]and the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall each assess the potential for cost-effective integration of Smart Grid technologies and capabilities in all products that are reviewed by the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]and the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], respectively, for potential designation as Energy Star products.

==(b) Analysis– ==


:(1) Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]and the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall each prepare an analysis of the potential energy savings, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and electricity cost savings that could accrue for each of the products identified by the assessment in subsection (a) in the following optimal circumstances:
::(A) The products possessed Smart Grid capability and interoperability that is tested and proven reliable.
::(B) The products were utilized in an electricity utility service area which had Smart Grid capability and offered customers rate or program incentives to use the products.
::(C) The utility’s rates reflected national average costs, including average peak and valley seasonal and daily electricity costs.
::(D) Consumers using such products took full advantage of such capability.
::(E) The utility avoided incremental investments and rate increases related to such savings.
:(2) The analysis under paragraph (1) shall be considered the best case Smart Grid analysis. On the basis of such an analysis for each product, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]and the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall determine whether the installation of Smart Grid capability for such a product would be cost effective. For purposes of this paragraph, the term cost effective means that the cumulative savings from using the product under the best case Smart Grid circumstances for a period of one-half of the product’s expected useful life will be greater than the incremental cost of the Smart Grid features included in the product.
:(3) To the extent that including Smart Grid capability in any products analyzed under paragraph (2) is found to be cost effective in the best case, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]and the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall, not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act take each of the following actions:
::(A) Inform the manufacturer of such product of such finding of cost effectiveness.
::(B) Assess the potential contributions the development and use of products with Smart Grid technologies bring to reducing peak demand and promoting grid stability.
::(C) Assess the potential national energy savings and electricity cost savings that could be realized if Smart Grid potential were installed in the relevant products reviewed by the Energy Star program.
::(D) Assess and identify options for providing consumers information on products with Smart Grid capabilities, including the necessary conditions for cost-effective savings.
::(E) Submit a report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]summarizing the results of the assessment for each class of products, and presenting the potential energy and greenhouse gas savings that could result if Smart Grid capability were installed and utilized on such products. 

=Sec. 4. Inclusions of Smart Grid capability on appliance ENERGY GUIDE labels=

   Section 324(a)(2) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6294 42 U.S.C. 6294(a)(2)] )is amended by adding the following at the end:

<blockquote> 
:(J) 
::(i) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subparagraph, the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]]shall initiate a rulemaking to consider making a special note in a prominent manner on any ENERGY GUIDE label for any product actually including Smart Grid capability that—
:::(I) Smart Grid capability is a feature of that product;
:::(II) the use and value of that feature depended on the Smart Grid capability of the utility system in which the product was installed and the active utilization of that feature by the customer; and
:::(III) on a utility system with Smart Grid capability, the use of the product’s Smart Grid capability could reduce the customer’s cost of the product’s annual operation by an estimated dollar amount range representing the result of incremental energy and electricity cost savings that would result from the customer taking full advantage of such Smart Grid capability.
::(ii) Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this subparagraph, the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]]shall complete the rulemaking initiated under clause (i) . .
