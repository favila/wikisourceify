{{Center|A BILL}}

To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an interagency coordinating committee on pulmonary hypertension to develop recommendations to advance research, increase awareness and education, and improve health and health care, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Diagnosis Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Pulmonary hypertension is a serious, debilitating, and often fatal progressive condition where the blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerously high levels. In pulmonary hypertension patients, the walls of the arteries that take blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs thicken and constrict. As a result, the right side of the heart has to pump harder to move blood into the lungs, causing it to enlarge and ultimately fail.
:(2) In advanced stages of pulmonary hypertension, the patient is able to perform only minimal activity and has symptoms even when resting, resulting in considerable disability. The disease may worsen to the point where the patient is completely bedridden. In a matter of months, many pulmonary hypertension patients have become so functionally deteriorated that they have lost their jobs and are dependent on family and disability benefits.
:(3) Despite the importance of early diagnosis on prognosis, pulmonary hypertension is rarely picked up in a routine medical exam. Even in its later stages, the signs of the disease are frequently confused with more common conditions that affect the heart and lungs. Due to the fact that the average length of time between the onset of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis is presently 2.8 years, nearly three out of four patients have advanced pulmonary hypertension by the time they are accurately diagnosed.
:(4) While pulmonary hypertension remains an incurable condition, progress in our scientific understanding of the disease has led to the development and [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] approval of nine innovative therapies indicated to treat pulmonary hypertension.
:(5) Existing treatment options can significantly extend life and improve quality of life for patients with pulmonary hypertension. The effectiveness of pulmonary hypertension treatment options is directly tied to how early in the progression of the condition a patient can be accurately diagnosed and begin the correct regimen of therapies. Improved early intervention will improve health outcomes for pulmonary hypertension patients while reducing the necessity for more drastic and costly treatment options, such as a lung or heart-lung transplant.

=Sec. 3. Interagency pulmonary hypertension coordinating committee=



==(a) Establishment– ==

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (in this Act referred to as the “Secretary” ) shall establish a committee, to be known as the “ [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Interagency Pulmonary Hypertension Coordinating Committee]] ” (in this Act referred to as the “Committee” ), to make recommendations on, and coordinate, all efforts within the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] concerning pulmonary hypertension.

==(b) Responsibilities– ==

In carrying out its duties under this section, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Committee]] shall—
:(1) develop and annually update a summary of pulmonary hypertension advances in medical research and treatment development and improvement, early and accurate diagnosis, appropriate and timely intervention, transplantation, and access to care and therapies for patients;

::(B) recommendations to improve the transplantation criteria and process concerning lung and heart-lung transplants for pulmonary hypertension patients;
::(C) recommendations to improve public awareness and recognition of pulmonary hypertension;
::(D) recommendations to improve health care delivery and promote early and accurate diagnosis for pulmonary hypertension patients; and
