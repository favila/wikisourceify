			 provisions=



=={{anchor|HEF97AA12660849BB84B0DD8545AB2B84}}(a) Transfer of
			 conventional arms– ==

It is the
			 sense of [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] that it should be the policy of the United States to maintain
			 adherence to a policy of restraint in transferring conventional arms if
			 evidence exists of substantial risk that such arms will be used to commit or
			 facilitate serious violations of international human rights law or
			 international humanitarian law.

=={{anchor|H3C8E69B59CE74EA2ACAD42B79F0BC088}}(b) Arms control
			 agreements– ==

In furtherance of the policy described in subsection
			 (a), the [[Wikipedia:Executive Office of the President|President]], in negotiating any conventional arms control agreement,
			 should undertake a concerted effort—
:(1) to encourage the
			 national control list of each party to the agreement to cover all types of
			 weaponry, munitions, armaments and related material used for potentially lethal
			 force in military and law enforcement operations, as well as any parts,
			 components and accessories thereof, and machines, technologies and technical
			 expertise for making, developing and maintaining those items;
:(2) to conduct an
			 effective inquiry and meaningful assessment of each application or proposal for
			 authorization to export or internationally transfer arms on a case-by-case
			 basis;
:(3) to deny an arms transfer authorization if
			 there is a substantial risk that the arms will be used to commit or facilitate
			 serious violations of international human rights law or international
			 humanitarian law and to ensure such denial remains in place until steps are
			 taken to mitigate the level of risk;
:(4) to require import
			 and transit state authorizations, and certified end use assurances, before
			 issuing an export license or authorization for any international transfer of
			 conventional arms and to ensure minimum details in the end use assurance
			 include the exporter, consignee, purchasers, country of final destination,
			 description of type and quantity of items, specific purpose they will be used,
			 an expiration date, and an undertaking that they will not be used for purposes
			 other than those declared or re-exported without permission;
:(5) to require
			 delivery verification to be officially certified on receipt of the shipment of
			 conventional arms by the end user, which includes at a minimum, the name and
			 address of the exporter and the importer, the serial number of the import
			 certificate, a description of the goods, the quantity and value, the port of
			 arrival and the name of the ship, aircraft or other carrier; and
:(6) to require each
			 party to the agreement to establish a clear legal framework for lawful
			 brokering and shipping activities relating to transfers of conventional
			 arms.
