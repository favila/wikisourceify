[[w:|Mr. Paul]] (for himself,
[[w:|Mr. Heller]] , and
[[w:|Mr. Lee]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Committee on Environment and Public Works]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to permit Governors of States to regulate intrastate endangered species and intrastate threatened species, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “ Endangered Species Management Self-Determination Act” .

=Sec. 2. Definition of ESA=

In this Act, the term ESA means the Endangered Species Act of 1973( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq] .).

=Sec. 3. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the ESAwas passed in 1973 as a means of protecting and recovering species and has not been substantially revised in over 25 years;
:(2) the ESAhas not achieved its stated goal of recovering threatened species or endangered species;
:(3) of the species listed in accordance with the ESA, less than 1 percent of the total number of species in the United States have been recovered and removed from the list, largely due to data errors or other factors;
:(4) there is—
::(A) no comprehensive independent study of the costs or benefits of the ESA;
::(B) no full accounting of how much the Federal Government and State and local governments spend to implement, enforce, and comply with the ESA; and
::(C) no meaningful effort to account for the costs the ESAimposes on the private sector;
:(5) the ESAeffectively penalizes landowners for owning endangered species habitat by forcing them to bear the cost of conservation;
:(6) the regulatory listing process under the ESAhas become a tool for environmentalists to undermine, slow down, or halt construction of infrastructure projects, hampering economic growth and employment; and
:(7) litigation stemming from the ESAand some resulting settlements between the litigants and the Federal Government have made the ESAeven more unworkable, to the detriment of species.
