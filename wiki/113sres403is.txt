{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Condemning the actions of the Government of Turkey in restricting free expression and Internet freedom on social media.    Whereas an independent, unfettered media and freedom of expression, including on the Internet and social media sites, are essential elements of democratic, open societies;   Whereas infringement of press freedom in Turkey is a serious concern, with more journalists currently imprisoned in Turkey than in any other country;   Whereas millions of people in Turkey, including senior members of the Government of Turkey, use Twitter and other social media sites to communicate on a daily basis;   Whereas the Government of Turkey imposed a countrywide ban on access to Twitter on March 20, 2014, blocking the use of the communications platform to engage in political speech;   Whereas respected nongovernmental organizations such as Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, and Freedom House have condemned the decision to block Twitter as an attack on Internet freedom and freedom of expression in Turkey;   Whereas the President of Turkey, Abdullah Gul, defied the ban to send out a series of tweets questioning the government’s actions;   Whereas the Turkish Bar Association argued that the ban is unconstitutional and in violation of Turkish and European human rights laws; and   Whereas, on March 26, 2014, the district court in Ankara, Turkey, blocked implementation of the ban because it may restrict the freedoms of expression and communication, which are protected by the Turkish Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights: Now, therefore, be it
