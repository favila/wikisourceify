To permit the chief executive of a State to create an exemption from certain requirements of Federal environmental laws for producers of agricultural commodities, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H90E21BED87C64992926B0A03EF9937E6}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Flexibility to Farm Act”.

={{anchor|H34503111EE244B38AE7C9205E9571B85}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The agricultural community of the United States serves as the economic backbone of many communities and employs millions of Americans.
:(2) In recent years, one-size-fits-all policies issued by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have increased dramatically, requiring agricultural producers to focus on regulation compliance rather than on growing the world’s healthiest, most abundant food supply.
:(3) Attempts by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to expand the definition of“navigable waters”under the Federal Water Pollution Control Actexpand the scope of Federal jurisdiction under that Act well beyond the intent of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , and would eliminate a central precept of that Act, which reserves certain waters to the exclusive jurisdiction of the States.
:(4) The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency’s]] interpretation of the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure program has attempted to regulate milk in the same manner as petroleum, requiring dairy farmers to develop oil spill prevention plans and moving far beyond common sense and the intent of the law.
:(5) An increasing number of poultry and livestock operations have been forced to apply for permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System resulting from the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency’s]] expanding definition of what constitutes a discharge under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
:(6) Duplicative and costly permitting requirements under the Federal Water Pollution Control Actwill require additional National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits for pesticide applications, subjecting pesticide users to unnecessary red tape and financial burdens while exposing them to the threat of unfounded litigation.
:(7) The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] has initiated a program to regulate greenhouse gases as“air pollutants”under the Clean Air Act, which could impose an undue burden on agricultural producers by requiring them to obtain permits to continue operations.
:(8) The Federal Government should not impose further rules or regulations that are overly burdensome or cause economic hardship for the agricultural community.
