{{section|H6B04D32BBB1C4B0B8EDA0508A973C54D|3. Study and report}}
(a)
Study
(1)
In
			 general
The Federal banking
			 agencies shall, jointly, conduct a study of the impact of the Standardized
			 Approach NPR and the Advanced Approach NPR, respectively, on the minimum
			 regulatory capital requirements of insured depository institutions and insured
			 depository institution holding companies. As part of this study, the Federal
			 banking agencies shall separately identify the various provisions of the
			 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
, and of amendments
			 made by that Act, that affect capital quality, capital levels, asset quality,
			 and the risk management activities of insured depository institutions and
			 insured depository holding companies (hereinafter identified
			 provisions
) and take into consideration the impact of such provisions.
			 Without excluding any provisions the Federal banking agencies identify as
			 affecting capital quality, capital levels, asset quality, and the risk
			 management activities of insured depository institutions and insured depository
			 holding companies, the identified provisions shall include the following
			 provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
,
			 and the amendments made by such provisions of such Act:
(A)
Section 115

			 (regarding enhanced supervision and prudential standards).

(B)
Section 165

			 (regarding enhanced supervision and prudential standards).

(C)
Section 166

			 (regarding early remediation requirements).

(D)
Section 171

			 (regarding leverage and risk-based capital requirements).

(E)
Section 619

			 (regarding prohibitions on proprietary trading and certain relationships with
			 hedge funds and private equity funds).

(F)
Section 939

			 (regarding the removal of statutory references to credit ratings).

(G)
Section 941

			 (regarding regulation of credit risk retention and exemption of qualified
			 residential mortgages).

(H)
Section 1412

			 (regarding safe harbor and rebuttable presumptions for qualified
			 mortgages).


(2)
Contents of
			 study
In conducting the study
			 required in paragraph (1)
, the Federal banking agencies shall determine and
			 make projections of the likely cumulative impact of the Standardized Approach
			 NPR, the Advanced Approach NPR, the Basel III NPR, and the identified
			 provisions on required regulatory capital levels, capital quality, asset
			 quality, and risk management at covered financial institutions. Based on these
			 findings, the Federal banking agencies shall provide an assessment
			 regarding—
(A)
changes to
			 required capital levels;

(B)
the aggregate increase or decrease of total
			 risk-weighted asset levels for the institutions to which the Standardized
			 Approach NPR or Advanced Approach NPR would be applicable based on current
			 assets;

(C)
whether the NPRs
			 and identified provisions will cause capital levels at covered institutions to
			 fluctuate with more frequency or by greater amounts than the current rules and
			 indicate what, if any, safety and soundness issues such fluctuations raise for
			 financial institutions or the financial system;

(D)
whether the NPRs
			 and the identified provisions will result in the discontinuation of the use of
			 certain risk management tools by covered financial institutions and the impact
			 on the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the financial
			 system;

(E)
the impact the
			 NPRs and the identified provisions will have on residential mortgage lending
			 and home equity lines of credit;

(F)
the likely
			 cumulative impact of the NPRs and the identified provisions will have on the
			 availability of credit, generally and in low- and moderate-income areas;

(G)
the variance in required capital levels,
			 assets, and asset quality between institutions that implement the advanced
			 approaches or approaches to risk weighting of assets and those that use the
			 Standardized Approach NPR or the Advanced Approach NPR and the impact on
			 competition between entities using different approaches; and

(H)
historical probability of default and loss
			 given default of residential mortgage loans and the proposed risk weightings in
			 the Standardized Approach NPR and the Advanced Approach NPR, and whether such
			 proposed risk weightings are appropriately and fairly calibrated.


(3)
Voluntary
			 participation
The Federal banking agencies may seek input and
			 participation from insured depository institutions and insured depository
			 institution holding companies, however, participation in the study by insured
			 depository institutions and insured depository institution holding companies
			 shall be voluntary.


(b)
Report
(1)
In
			 general
The Federal banking agencies shall issue a report to the
			 Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate
 and the
			 Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives
 on the results
			 of the study required by subsection (a)
.

(2)
Contents
The
			 Federal banking agencies shall include the methodologies and assumptions used
			 in the study as well as the required elements of the study listed in subsection
			 (a)

{{section|H73389A3A250C4F09B9100D8617390A59|4. Competitive equality}}
Section 908(a)(1) of
			 the International Lending Supervision Act of 1983
 (12 U.S.C. 3907(a)(1)

)
 is
			 amended by inserting at the end the following:
Each appropriate Federal banking agency
				shall, consistent with safety and soundness, seek to ensure that any
				differences in rules implementing the capital standards required under this
				section or other provisions of Federal law for banking institutions, savings
				associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies do
				not give competitive advantages to any class or group of such institutions,
				associations, or companies unless required by other Federal law, and do not
				undermine any requirements for enhanced supervision and prudential standards
				required by section 115 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
				Protection Act
 (12 U.S.C.
				5325
)
