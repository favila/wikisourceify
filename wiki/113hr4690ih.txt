=Section 1. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:

This commitment to others exemplifies the highest traditions of American spirit.
:(2) As an element of the emergency services sector, emergency medical services stands on the Nation’s first line of defense in the prevention and mitigation of risk from terrorist attacks, man-made incidents, and natural disasters.
