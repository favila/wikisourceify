{{section|H9999892B969340E19B69C4F0D553F08A|2. Findings and purposes}}
(a)
Findings
[[United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
(1)
Evidence-based
			 research has conclusively documented that youth with significant disabilities
			 who were educated in inclusive settings, were exposed to work experience and
			 career exploration, and participated in a paid work experience while in school
			 had better postsecondary outcomes and higher rates of sustainable
			 employment.

(2)
Higher rates of
			 self-determination, in which individuals with significant disabilities and
			 their families have direct control over the decision-making process in order to
			 ensure an appropriate individualized transition strategy, lead to better
			 outcomes.

(3)
Regulations and
			 processes allowing for flexibility in the blending and braiding of government
			 funds to ensure seamless, collaborative strategies during the transition
			 process lead to better outcomes for individuals with significant
			 disabilities.

(4)
Agency officials
			 involved directly in the provision of supports and services during a youth’s
			 transition into adulthood and beyond must be provided additional training to
			 become properly prepared to adequately address the individual transition needs
			 of students with significant disabilities.


(b)
Purposes
The purposes of this Act are the
			 following:
(1)
Create a holistic
			 system across multiple partners focused on successful transition of youth with
			 significant disabilities into adulthood.

(2)
Create a systemic
			 focus on achieving high expectations for all youth, through equality of
			 opportunity, full participation through self-determination and informed choice,
			 outcomes related to post-secondary options that lead to competitive integrated
			 employment and economic self-sufficiency.

(3)
Promote innovative
			 strategies to foster academic, professional, and social inclusion, and the
			 solidification of long-term supports and services required to ensure full
			 integration into the community setting.

(4)
Better define and
			 coordinate specific services related to the effective transition of youth with
			 significant disabilities.

(5)
Eliminate barriers
			 and promote incentives for multiple stakeholders to collaborate and improve
			 transition opportunities for youth with significant disabilities.
