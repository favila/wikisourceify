 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit to encourage private employers to hire veterans, to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the reasonable efforts an employer may make under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act with respect to hiring veterans, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title; findings=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“   Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2014   ”or the“ HERO Transition from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2014 ”.

==(b) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The majority of men and women transitioning from the Armed Services to the civilian sector have experienced difficulty in making the transition and regard their greatest challenge to be finding a job that is meaningful to them even though nearly 90 percent of them believe they have the general skills needed to land their ideal job such as problem solving, leadership, ethics, and time management and most believe they possess specific marketable skills, such as information technology, health care, mechanical, and aviation.
:(2) Among the biggest challenges veterans face in securing suitable employment in the civilian sector are: overcoming the difficulty in translating to employers the value of the skills they learned in the military; competing with candidates who have been in the workforce longer; the perceived reluctance of employers to hire due to concerns about multiple deployments or military training and time commitments of the Reserve Component; and fears of dealing with veterans’ disabilities.
:(3) Studies have shown that more than 80 percent of veterans transitioning from military service to the civilian sector regard employer-provided veteran support programs as “critical” or “important” to their success and believe it is important for employers to provide flexible leave for the health issues they face.
