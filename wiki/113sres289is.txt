:(1) established the United States Olympic Committee as the coordinating body for all Olympic and Paralympic athletic activity in the United States;
:(2) gave the United States Olympic Committee the exclusive right in the United States to use the words “Olympic” , “Olympiad” , “Paralympic” , and “Paralympiad” , the emblem of the United States Olympic Committee, and the symbols of the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee; and
:(3) empowered the United States Olympic Committee to authorize sponsors that contribute to the United States Olympic or Paralympic teams to use any trademark, symbol, insignia, or emblem of the International Olympic Committee, International Paralympic Committee, the Pan-American Sports Organization, or the United States Olympic Committee;Whereas Team USA is significantly funded by 31 sponsors who assure that the United States has the best Olympic teams possible;Whereas, in recent years, a number of entities in the United States have engaged in ambush marketing as a marketing strategy, affiliating themselves with the Olympic and Paralympic Games without becoming sponsors of Team USA;Whereas ambush marketing harms the United States Olympic and Paralympic teams, undermines sponsorship activities, and gives ambush marketers an unfair and unethical advantage over entities that officially sponsor and provide funding for the elite athletes of the United States; andWhereas efforts to prevent ambush marketing have enjoyed limited success as the strategies used by ambush marketers continue to multiply: Now, therefore, be it
