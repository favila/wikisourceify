[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following
			 findings:

			 cost of diabetes is a significant concern for State Medicaid programs. By 2021,
			 the Medicaid program is expected to cover 13,000,000 people with diabetes and
			 about 9,000,000 people who may have pre-diabetes. By 2021, States will spend an
			 estimated $83,000,000,000 on individuals with diabetes or pre-diabetes.
:(2) The National
			 Diabetes Prevention Program, as established by the [[Wikipedia:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control
			 and Prevention]], has been proven to reduce the onset of diabetes in at-risk
			 adults by 58 percent, using a cost-effective, community-based
			 intervention.

=={{anchor|HEF93A86B863444F194E108223619A792}}(b) Sense of the
			 House of Representatives– ==

It is the sense of the [[Wikipedia:United States House of Representatives|House of
			 Representatives]] that the National Diabetes Prevention Program presents an
			 opportunity for States to reduce the incidence of diabetes among individuals
			 enrolled in their Medicaid programs.
