{{section|H1431F66855DA4D919F22542F6C0B9444|1. Consideration by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the costs and benefits of its regulations and orders}}

        Section
			 15(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act
 (7 U.S.C. 19(a)
)
 is amended by striking
			 paragraphs (1)
 and (2)
 and inserting the following:
(1)
In
				general
Before promulgating a
				regulation under this Act or issuing an order (except as provided in paragraph
				(3)
), the [[|Commission]], through the Office of the Chief Economist, shall assess
				the costs and benefits, both qualitative and quantitative, of the intended
				regulation and propose or adopt a regulation only on a reasoned determination
				that the benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs of the intended
				regulation (recognizing that some benefits and costs are difficult to
				quantify). It must measure, and seek to improve, the actual results of
				regulatory requirements.

(2)
Considerations
In
				making a reasoned determination of the costs and the benefits, the [[|Commission]]
				shall evaluateâ€”
(A)
considerations of protection of market
				participants and the public;

(B)
considerations of
				the efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of futures and swaps
				markets;

(C)
considerations of
				the impact on market liquidity in the futures and swaps markets;

(D)
considerations of
				price discovery;

(E)
considerations of
				sound risk management practices;

(F)
available
				alternatives to direct regulation;

(G)
the degree and
				nature of the risks posed by various activities within the scope of its
				jurisdiction;

(H)
whether,
				consistent with obtaining regulatory objectives, the regulation is tailored to
				impose the least burden on society, including market participants, individuals,
				businesses of differing sizes, and other entities (including small communities
				and governmental entities), taking into account, to the extent practicable, the
				cumulative costs of regulations;

(I)
whether the
				regulation is inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative of other Federal
				regulations;

(J)
whether, in
				choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, those approaches maximize net
				benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and other benefits,
				distributive impacts, and equity); and

(K)
other public
				interest
				considerations.
