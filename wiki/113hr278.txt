Congress finds that it has the authority to
			 establish the terms and conditions States must follow in carrying out
			 Congressional redistricting after an apportionment of Members of the House of
			 Representatives because—
:(1) the authority

			 United States gives [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] the power to enact laws governing the time, place,
			 and manner of elections for Members of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]; and
:(2) the authority
			 granted to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment to the
			 Constitution gives [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] the power to enact laws to enforce section 2 of
			 such amendment, which requires Representatives to be apportioned among the
			 several States according to their number.
