				number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of
				outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.

={{anchor|HAD0F1FDBC6F74D2D9796E8DBE5A6B71D}}2. =

The limit on the debt of the United States
				held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the whole
