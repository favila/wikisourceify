{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of Congress that Taiwan and its 23,000,000 people deserve membership in the United Nations.    Whereas for more than 50 years a close relationship has existed between the United States and Taiwan, which has been of major economic, cultural, and strategic advantage to both countries;   Whereas the 23,000,000 people in Taiwan are not represented in the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]];   Whereas Taiwan has over the years repeatedly expressed its strong desire to participate in the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]];   Whereas Taiwan has much to contribute to the work and funding of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]];   Whereas the world community has reacted positively to Taiwan's desire for international participation, as shown by Taiwan's membership in the [[w:Asian Development Bank|Asian Development Bank]], Taiwan's admission to the [[w:Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]group as a full member, and Taiwan's membership in the World Trade Organization, and Taiwan’s participation in the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]]; and   Whereas  section 4(d) of the Taiwan Relations Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/3303 22 U.S.C. 3303(d)] )declares,“Nothing in this Act may be construed as a basis for supporting the exclusion or expulsion of Taiwan from continued membership in any international financial institution or any other international organization.”: Now, therefore, be it
