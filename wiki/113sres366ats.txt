{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week.    Whereas multiple sclerosis (MS) can impact people of all ages, races, and ethnicities;   Whereas MS is 2 to 3 times more common in women than in men;   Whereas while MS is not directly inherited, studies show there are genetic and, probably, environmental, ethnic, and geographic factors that make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease;   Whereas worldwide, there are approximately 2,300,000 people who have been diagnosed with MS;   Whereas MS is typically diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, however, it is estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents in the United States are living with MS;   Whereas MS is an unpredictable neurological disease that interrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and the rest of the body;   Whereas symptoms of MS range from numbness and tingling in the extremities to blindness and paralysis, and the progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any affected individual cannot yet be predicted;   Whereas there is no single laboratory test available that provides a definitive diagnosis for MS;   Whereas the exact cause of MS is still unknown, and there is no cure;   Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national network of independent organizations dedicated to enhancing quality of life for all those affected by MS, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of every year;   Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is to enhance cooperation among organizations to provide greater benefits to individuals and families affected by MS;   Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are to invite people to join the movement to end MS, encourage people to demonstrate their commitment to moving toward a world free from MS, and acknowledge those who have dedicated their time and talent to advancing MS research and programs; and   Whereas this year Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is being recognized during the week of March 3, 2014, through March 9, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
