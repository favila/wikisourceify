Calling for free and fair elections in Iran, and for other purposes.Whereas democracy, human rights, and civil liberties are universal values and fundamental principles of United States foreign policy;Whereas an essential element of democratic self-government is for leaders to be chosen and regularly held accountable through elections that are organized and conducted in a manner that is free, fair, inclusive, and consistent with international standards;Whereas governments whose power does not derive from free and fair elections lack democratic legitimacy;Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted December 16, 1966 (ICCPR), which states that every citizen has the right to vote “at genuine periodic elections” that reflect “the free expression of the will of the electors”;Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran regularly violates its obligations under the ICCPR, holding elections that are neither free nor fair nor consistent with international standards;Whereas elections in Iran are marred by the disqualification of candidates based on their political views; the absence of credible international observers; severe restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and association, including censorship, surveillance, and disruptions in telecommunications, and the absence of a free media; widespread intimidation and repression of candidates, political parties, and citizens; and systemic electoral fraud and manipulation;Whereas the last nationwide election held in Iran, on June 12, 2009, was widely condemned inside Iran and throughout the world as neither free nor fair and provoked large-scale peaceful protests throughout Iran;Whereas, following the June 12, 2009, election, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran responded to peaceful protests with a large-scale campaign of politically motivated violence, intimidation, and repression, including acts of torture, cruel and degrading treatment in detention, rape, executions, extrajudicial killings, and indefinite detention;Whereas, on December 26, 2011, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution denouncing the serious human rights abuses occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran;Whereas no woman has ever been permitted to run for president by the Council of Guardians;Whereas authorities in Iran have announced that nationwide elections for the presidency and for municipal councils will be held in June 2013;Whereas no international election observers are scheduled to oversee the June 2013 elections;Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to hold candidates from the 2009 election under house arrest and dissidents in indefinite detention; andWhereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran seeks to prevent the people of Iran from accessing news and information by incarcerating more journalists than any other country in the world, according to a 2011 report from the Committee to Protect Journalists; disrupting access to the Internet, including blocking e-mail and social networking sites and limiting access to foreign news and Web sites, developing a national Internet that will facilitate government censorship of news and information, and jamming international broadcasts such as the Voice of America’s Persian News Network and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Radio Farda: Now, therefore, be it
