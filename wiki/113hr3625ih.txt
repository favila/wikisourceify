{{Center|
[[w:Mo Brooks|Mr. Brooks of Alabama]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for termination liability costs for certain National Aeronautics and Space Administration projects, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The International Space Station, the Space Launch System, and the Orion crew capsule will enable the Nation to continue operations in low-Earth orbit and to send its astronauts to deep space. As a result of their unique capabilities and their critical contribution to the future of space exploration, these systems have been designated by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] as priority investments.
:(2) While the Space Launch System and the Orion programs, currently under development, have made significant progress, they have not been funded at levels authorized, and as a result congressionally authorized milestones will be delayed by several years.
:(3) In addition, contractors are currently holding program funding, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, to cover the potential termination liability should the Government choose to terminate a program for convenience. As a result, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are unavailable for meaningful work on these programs.
:(4) According to the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] , the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] procures most of its goods and services through contracts, and it terminates very few of them. In fiscal year 2010, the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|Administration]] terminated 28 of 16,343 active contracts and orders—a termination rate of about 0.17 percent.
:(5) Providing processes requiring congressional action on termination of these high-priority programs would enable contractors to apply taxpayer dollars to making maximum progress in meeting the established technical goals and schedule milestones of these programs.
