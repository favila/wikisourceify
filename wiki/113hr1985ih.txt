<blockquote>
::(6) consumers of oilheat fuel are provided service by thousands of small businesses that are unable to individually develop training programs to facilitate the entry of new and qualified workers into the oilheat fuel industry;
::(7) small businesses and trained employees are in an ideal position—
:::(A) to provide information to consumers about the benefits of improved efficiency; and
:::(B) to encourage consumers to value efficiency in energy choices and assist individuals in conserving energy;
::(8) additional research is necessary—
:::(A) to improve oilheat fuel equipment; and
:::(B) to develop domestic renewable resources that can be used to safely and affordably heat homes;
