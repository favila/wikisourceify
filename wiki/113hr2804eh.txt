:(2) Other statutory considerations applicable to whether the agency can or should propose a rule or undertake other agency action.
:(3) The specific nature and significance of the problem the agency may address with a rule (including the degree and nature of risks the problem poses and the priority of addressing those risks compared to other matters or activities within the agency’s jurisdiction), whether the problem warrants new agency action, and the countervailing risks that may be posed by alternatives for new agency action.

::(A) the alternative of no Federal response;
::(B) amending or rescinding existing rules;
::(C) potential regional, State, local, or tribal regulatory action or other responses that could be taken in lieu of agency action; and

::(B) means to increase the cost-effectiveness of any Federal response; and
::(C) incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability, lower costs of enforcement and compliance (to government entities, regulated entities, and the public), and flexibility. 

====(c) Advance notice of proposed rule making for major rules, high-Impact rules, negative-Impact on jobs and wages rules, and rules involving novel legal or policy issues– ====

In the case of a rule making for a major rule, a high-impact rule, a negative-impact on jobs and wages rule, or a rule that involves a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates, not later than 90 days before a notice of proposed rule making is published in the Federal Register, an agency shall publish advance notice of proposed rule making in the Federal Register.

::(D) in the case of a rule that involves a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates, the nature of and potential reasons to adopt the novel legal or policy position upon which the agency may base a proposed rule; and
::(E) an achievable objective for the rule and metrics by which the agency will measure progress toward that objective;
:(2) solicit written data, views or argument from interested persons concerning the information and issues addressed in the advance notice; and

:(b) The plan shall provide for the review of all such agency rules existing on the date of the enactment of this section within 10 years of the date of publication of the plan in the Federal Register and for review of rules adopted after the date of enactment of this section within 10 years after the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. If the head of the agency determines that completion of the review of existing rules is not feasible by the established date, the head of the agency shall so certify in a statement published in the Federal Register and may extend the review for not longer than 2 years after publication of notice of extension in the Federal Register. Such certification and notice shall be sent to the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]]and the Congress.
:(c) The plan shall include a section that details how an agency will conduct outreach to and meaningfully include small businesses (including small business concerns owned and controlled by women, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (as such terms are defined in the Small Business Act )) for the purposes of carrying out this section. The agency shall include in this section a plan for how the agency will contact small businesses and gather their input on existing agency rules.
:(d) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding the results of its review pursuant to such plan to the Congress, the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]], and, in the case of agencies other than independent regulatory agencies (as defined in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3502  section 3502(5)of title 44]) to the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]]of the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management and Budget]]. Such report shall include the identification of any rule with respect to which the head of the agency made a determination described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 paragraph (5)]or[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 (6) of subsection (e)]and a detailed explanation of the reasons for such determination.
:(e) In reviewing a rule pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 subsections (a) through (d)], the agency shall amend or rescind the rule to minimize any adverse significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or disproportionate economic impact on a specific class of small entities, or maximize any beneficial significant economic impact of the rule on a substantial number of small entities to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes. In amending or rescinding the rule, the agency shall consider the following factors:
::(1) The continued need for the rule.
::(2) The nature of complaints received by the agency from small entities concerning the rule.
::(3) Comments by the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]].
::(4) The complexity of the rule.
::(5) The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts with other Federal rules and, unless the head of the agency determines it to be infeasible, State, territorial, and local rules.
::(6) The contribution of the rule to the cumulative economic impact of all Federal rules on the class of small entities affected by the rule, unless the head of the agency determines that such calculations cannot be made and reports that determination in the annual report required under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 subsection (d)].
::(7) The length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.
:(f) Each year, each agency shall publish in the Federal Register and on its website a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to such plan. The agency shall include in the publication a solicitation of public comments on any further inclusions or exclusions of rules from the list, and shall respond to such comments. Such publication shall include a brief description of the rule, the reason why the agency determined that it has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (without regard to whether it had prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and request comments from the public, the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]], and the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman concerning the enforcement of the rule. .
