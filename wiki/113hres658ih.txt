{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for a whole child approach to education and recognizing the role of parents, educators, and community members in providing a whole child approach to education for each student.    Whereas each student deserves to be challenged academically, exposed to a comprehensive education that promotes critical thinking and creativity, and prepared for higher education, meaningful employment in our global economy, and lifelong success;   Whereas each student deserves to be supported by qualified, caring adults and receive access to personalized learning;   Whereas each student deserves to learn about and practice a healthy lifestyle;   Whereas each student deserves to learn in an environment that is physically and emotionally safe;   Whereas each student deserves to be actively engaged in learning and connected to the school and broader community;   Whereas the consequences of not ensuring that our young people are challenged, supported, healthy, safe, and engaged are clear;   Whereas the average graduation rate for United States students rose to 80 percent in 2012, but the graduation rate the same year for students with disabilities was only 61 percent, the rate for English language learners was 59 percent, and the rate for economically disadvantaged students was 71 percent;   Whereas according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], most United States youth do not get the recommended amount of daily physical activity, and students who lack the food and resources for healthy living are less likely to be attentive in school and have higher absenteeism, which can lead to lower academic performance;   Whereas students who feel unsafe in school are more prone to truancy and disruptive behaviors, have lower grades, and may drop out of school entirely, and, according to the Indicators of School Crime and Safety report of 2012, 74 percent of public schools reported one or more violent incidents of crime from 2009–2010, and 32 percent of middle and high school students reported being bullied during the 2007 school year; and   Whereas the Partnership for 21st Century Skills reports that future employees must know how to communicate, collaborate, be creative, and think critically, and, according to the Alliance for Excellent Education, unless graduation rates improve, nearly 12 million students will likely drop out over the next decade, resulting in a loss to the national economy of $1.5 trillion: Now, therefore, be it
