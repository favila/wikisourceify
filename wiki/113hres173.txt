Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to make commonsense reforms under sequestration, Federal employees should be encouraged to suggest ways to make more sensible or more efficient budget reductions within their employing department or agency, knowing that they are protected under the whistleblower protection laws.Whereas on March 1, 2013, sequestration took effect, thereby reducing the money available to Federal agencies;Whereas the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed 2 bills that would have made commonsense reforms to reductions in [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] programs and certain domestic programs;Whereas the Government spent $3.538 trillion in the fiscal year that ended in September 2012, and the $85 billion sequester is 2.4 percent of the Federal budget;Whereas the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] is implementing several tactics in his discussion of the potential effects of sequestration that needlessly alarm the American people, but there is some flexibility and discretion on how to implement the cuts, and the President must focus on more sensible reductions that can be made within departments and agencies;Whereas given the rising national debt and deficit, the Federal Government must reduce funding to programs, projects, and activities that are wasteful;Whereas the April 2013 [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] entitled, Actions Needed to Reduce Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication and Achieve Other Financial Benefits (and designated as GAO–13–279SP), presents 31 areas in which Government programs would be able to achieve greater efficiencies or become more effective in providing Government services; andWhereas it is the responsibility of the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director of the Office of Management and Budget]] to coordinate with the heads of the relevant departments and agencies to eliminate, consolidate, or streamline Government programs and agencies with duplicative and overlapping missions to save taxpayer dollars, rein in Washington spending, and curb the unnecessary consequences of sequestration: Now, therefore, be it
