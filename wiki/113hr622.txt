			 in Tinian=



=={{anchor|H2EB2CEA5C9D04A859963E7487AD444D4}}(a) Short
			 title– ==

This section may be
			 cited as the “American Memorial Park
			 Tinian Annex Act”.

=={{anchor|H414E17FE6B8040C8ACB21247FB542DA7}}(b) Findings– ==

Congress finds as follows:
:(1) In 2001 the
			 [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park Service]] conducted a suitability and feasibility study of North
			 Field on the island of Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
			 for inclusion in the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park System]].
:(2) North Field Tinian
			 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an historic district
			 and has been designated a national historic landmark.
:(3) The [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of
			 Defense]] holds a 50-year lease over North Field Tinian.
:(4) The [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park
			 Service]] determined that North Field Tinian was suitable for inclusion as
			 “one of the most significant World War II sites in the Pacific”
			 because atomic bombs were flown to Hiroshima and Nagasaki from this
			 site.
:(5) The [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park
			 Service]] determined, however, that it was not feasible to include North Field
			 Tinian as a unit of the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park System]] because of the “military’s
			 future long term needs”.
:(6) American Memorial
			 Park on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, is
			 managed by the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park Service]], as authorized under Public Law 94–241 and
			 Public Law 95–348, to commemorate the World War II Marianas Campaign.
:(7) A
			 Tinian Annex to the American Memorial Park could provide the opportunity for on
			 and off site interpretation of North Field without conflicting with military
			 needs.

=={{anchor|HE672FACBCFE84E418EF9310A7E82437D}}(c) Establishment– ==

Using existing facilities instead of
			 developing new facilities to the extent practicable, the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the
			 Interior]], acting through the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park Service]], shall develop, maintain,
			 and administer an annex in Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
			 Islands, as an extension of the American Memorial Park located in Saipan, on an
			 appropriate parcel of Tinian Public Land to be agreed upon by the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park
			 Service]] and the Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands in consultation with
			 the Mayor of Tinian. The annex shall be used to—
:(1) interpret the
			 important aspects of North Field by highlighting the historic events related to
			 the World War II Marianas Campaign; and
:(2) serve as a
			 curatorial storage of World War II artifacts.
