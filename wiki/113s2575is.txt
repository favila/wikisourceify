:(1) pursuant to the court-approved work schedule described in the Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement Agreement and Order of Dismissal of Guardians Claims entitled“In Re Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation”(D.D.C. 2011), not later than September 30, 2015, the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]]is scheduled to issue a decision on whether to proceed with listing the greater sage-grouse as a threatened or endangered species under the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] );
:(2) the Federal Government, through programs of the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]and the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], has invested substantial funds on greater and Gunnison sage-grouse conservation efforts to avoid the greater and Gunnison sage-grouse being listed as threatened or endangered species under the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.] );
:(3) State wildlife management agencies have prepared, and as of the date of enactment of this Act are in the process of implementing, greater and Gunnison sage-grouse conservation plans to complement the conservation efforts of the Federal Government;
:(4) private investment in conservation efforts, independently and in conjunction with Federal cost-share conservation easement programs, has been significant;
:(5) through a combination of Federal, State, and private efforts, significant conservation progress is being made, and further progress will be made following full implementation of State management plans and new Federal conservation programs; and
