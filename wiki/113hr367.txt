      Purpose
      The purpose of this Act is to increase
			 accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section
			 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers
			 to Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional
			 charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability
			 for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the
			 REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an
			 improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable
			 to the American people for the laws imposed upon them.

            Congressional
				approval procedure for major rules
						
              (a)
              
                (1)
                For purposes of this
				section, the term joint resolution means only a joint resolution
				addressing a report classifying a rule as major pursuant to section
				801(a)(1)(A)(iii) that—
								
                  (A)
                  bears no preamble;
								
                
                  (B)
                  bears the following title (with blanks
				filled as appropriate): Approving the rule submitted by ___ relating to
				___.;
								
                
                  (C)
                  includes after its resolving clause
				only the following (with blanks filled as appropriate): That Congress
				approves the rule submitted by ___ relating to ___.; and

				(2).
								
              
              
                (2)
                After a House of Congress receives a
				report classifying a rule as major pursuant to section 801(a)(1)(A)(iii), the
				majority leader of that House (or his or her respective designee) shall
				introduce (by request, if appropriate) a joint resolution described in
				paragraph (1)—
								
                  (A)
                  in the case of the 
                [[United States House of Representatives|House of
				Representatives]]
            , within three legislative days; and
								
                
                  (B)
                  in the case of the 
                [[United States Senate|Senate]]
            , within
				three session days.
								
              
              
                (3)
                A joint resolution described in
				paragraph (1) shall not be subject to amendment at any stage of
				proceeding.
							
            
            
              (b)
              A joint resolution
				described in subsection (a) shall be referred in each House of Congress to the
				committees having jurisdiction over the provision of law under which the rule
				is issued.
						
            
              (c)
              In the 
                [[United States Senate|Senate]]
            , if the committee or
				committees to which a joint resolution described in subsection (a) has been
				referred have not reported it at the end of 15 session days after its
				introduction, such committee or committees shall be automatically discharged
				from further consideration of the resolution and it shall be placed on the
				calendar. A vote on final passage of the resolution shall be taken on or before
				the close of the 15th session day after the resolution is reported by the
				committee or committees to which it was referred, or after such committee or
				committees have been discharged from further consideration of the
				resolution.
						
            
              (d)
              
                (1)
                In the 
                [[United States Senate|Senate]]
            , when the
				committee or committees to which a joint resolution is referred have reported,
				or when a committee or committees are discharged (under subsection (c)) from
				further consideration of a joint resolution described in subsection (a), it is
				at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same
				effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to the consideration of
				the joint resolution, and all points of order against the joint resolution (and
				against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived. The motion is not
				subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to
				the consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which
				the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to
				proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the joint
				resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed
				of.
							
              
                (2)
                In the 
                [[United States Senate|Senate]]
            , debate on the joint
				resolution, and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith,
				shall be limited to not more than 2 hours, which shall be divided equally
				between those favoring and those opposing the joint resolution. A motion to
				further limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a
				motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other
				business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in order.
							
              
                (3)
                In the 
                [[United States Senate|Senate]]
            , immediately following
				the conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a),
				and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in
				accordance with the rules of the Senate, the vote on final passage of the joint
				resolution shall occur.
							
              
                (4)
                Appeals from the decisions of the
				Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure
				relating to a joint resolution described in subsection (a) shall be decided
				without debate.
							
            
            
              (e)
              In the 
                [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]
            , if any
				committee to which a joint resolution described in subsection (a) has been
				referred has not reported it to the House at the end of 15 legislative days
				after its introduction, such committee shall be discharged from further
				consideration of the joint resolution, and it shall be placed on the
				appropriate calendar. On the second and fourth Thursdays of each month it shall
				be in order at any time for the Speaker to recognize a Member who favors
				passage of a joint resolution that has appeared on the calendar for at least 5
				legislative days to call up that joint resolution for immediate consideration
				in the House without intervention of any point of order. When so called up a
				joint resolution shall be considered as read and shall be debatable for 1 hour
				equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and the
				previous question shall be considered as ordered to its passage without
				intervening motion. It shall not be in order to reconsider the vote on passage.
				If a vote on final passage of the joint resolution has not been taken by the
				third Thursday on which the Speaker may recognize a Member under this
				subsection, such vote shall be taken on that day.
						
            
              (f)
              
                (1)
                If, before passing a
				joint resolution described in subsection (a), one House receives from the other
				a joint resolution having the same text, then—
								
                  (A)
                  the joint resolution of the other
				House shall not be referred to a committee; and
								
                
                  (B)
                  the procedure in the receiving House
				shall be the same as if no joint resolution had been received from the other
				House until the vote on passage, when the joint resolution received from the
				other House shall supplant the joint resolution of the receiving House.
								
              
              
                (2)
                This subsection shall not apply to the
				House of Representatives if the joint resolution received from the Senate is a
				revenue measure.
							
            
            
              (g)
              If either House
				has not taken a vote on final passage of the joint resolution by the last day
				of the period described in section 801(b)(2), then such vote shall be taken on
				that day.
						
            
              (h)
              This section and
				section 803 are enacted by Congress—
							
                (1)
                as an exercise of
				the rulemaking power of the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively,
				and as such is deemed to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but
				applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in
				the case of a joint resolution described in subsection (a) and superseding
				other rules only where explicitly so; and
							
              
                (2)
                with full
				recognition of the Constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so
				far as they relate to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same
				manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that
				House.
