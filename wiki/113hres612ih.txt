{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of Mexico should forthwith repatriate Sgt. Andrew Paul Tahmooressi from Mexican prison(s) and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President of the United States should take actions to impose sanctions on Mexico until such time as Sgt. Tahmooressi is released.    Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi served with the [[w:United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]for two tours of duty in Afghanistan earning a rare combat field promotion to Sergeant;   Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi was driving near the U.S.-Mexican border on March 31, 2014, when he took a wrong turn and unintentionally drove into Mexico. He was stopped by police in Mexico and arrested for possessing three firearms which were fully legal in Texas and were registered to him; and   Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi has a distinguished record in the [[w:United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]and there is no indication that Sgt. Tahmooressi was in violation of other laws in Mexico, except possession of his own firearms: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

:(1) the Government of Mexico should expeditiously release and repatriate Sgt. Tahmooressi and all possessions that have been seized; and
:(2) the [[w:President of the United States|President of the United States]]should communicate with the Government of Mexico that he will impose increasingly harsh sanctions on Mexico until such time as Sgt. Tahmooressi is released.
