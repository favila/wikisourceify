 To award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner to commemorate the lives they lost 50 years ago in an effort to bring justice and equality to Americans in Mississippi during Freedom Summer.   

=Section 1. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) June 21, 2014, will mark 50 years since the lives of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were brutally taken on the basis of racism and hatred.
:(2) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were assisting Congress of Racial Equality in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer of 1964, wherein they risked their lives leading voting registration efforts for people who were denied the right to vote.
:(3) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were imprisoned in Neshoba County, Mississippi, without due process and released into the dead of the night into the hands of Klansmen.
:(4) The disappearance of these devoted civil rights activists captured national attention and led to an investigation by the [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigations]].
:(5) Following a 44-day search by Federal agents, the grim remains of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were discovered in an earthen dam.
:(6) This tragedy galvanized momentum for the Civil Rights Movement and helped to secure the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and led to the first permanent [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation]]field office in the State of Mississippi.
:(7) Justice was delayed 41 years, to the day, for these three brave men and their families until a Neshoba County grand jury found 1 of the 18 men originally charged in the case guilty on three counts of murder.
:(8) These three valiant activists are representative of countless individuals who lost their lives on a quest for justice and equality, including Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie More whose bodies were also found during the massive search for Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.
:(9) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner’s legacy of advocacy and unyielding resolve for justice in the face of peril is one that continues to be embodied in young adults across this great country.
:(10) It is befitting that Congress bestow the highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2014 to James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, posthumously in recognition of the 50th commemoration of their kidnapping and subsequent murders.
