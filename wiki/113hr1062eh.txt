<blockquote>

==(e) Consideration of costs and benefits– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Before issuing a regulation under the securities laws, as defined in section 3(a), the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] shall—
:(A) clearly identify the nature and source of the problem that the proposed regulation is designed to address, as well as assess the significance of that problem, to enable assessment of whether any new regulation is warranted;
:(B) utilize the Chief Economist to assess the costs and benefits, both qualitative and quantitative, of the intended regulation and propose or adopt a regulation only on a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs of the regulation;
:(C) identify and assess available alternatives to the regulation that were considered, including modification of an existing regulation, together with an explanation of why the regulation meets the regulatory objectives more effectively than the alternatives; and
:(D) ensure that any regulation is accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to understand and shall measure, and seek to improve, the actual results of regulatory requirements.

===(2) Considerations and actions– ===



====(A) Required actions– ====

In deciding whether and how to regulate, the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] shall assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives, including the alternative of not regulating, and choose the approach that maximizes net benefits. Specifically, the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] shall—
:(i) consistent with the requirements of section 3(f)( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78c 15 U.S.C. 78c(f)] ), section 2(b) of the Securities Act of 1933( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77b 15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] ), section 202(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/80b–2 15 U.S.C. 80b–2(c)] ), and section 2(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/80a–2 15 U.S.C. 80a–2(c)] ), consider whether the rulemaking will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation;
:(ii) evaluate whether, consistent with obtaining regulatory objectives, the regulation is tailored to impose the least burden on society, including market participants, individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other entities (including State and local governmental entities), taking into account, to the extent practicable, the cumulative costs of regulations; and
:(iii) evaluate whether the regulation is inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative of other Federal regulations.

====(B) Additional considerations– ====

In addition, in making a reasoned determination of the costs and benefits of a potential regulation, the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] shall, to the extent that each is relevant to the particular proposed regulation, take into consideration the impact of the regulation on—
:(i) investor choice;
:(ii) market liquidity in the securities markets; and
:(iii) small businesses.

===(3) Explanation and comments– ===

The [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] shall explain in its final rule the nature of comments that it received, including those from the industry or consumer groups concerning the potential costs or benefits of the proposed rule or proposed rule change, and shall provide a response to those comments in its final rule, including an explanation of any changes that were made in response to those comments and the reasons that the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] did not incorporate those industry group concerns related to the potential costs or benefits in the final rule.

===(4) Review of Existing Regulations– ===

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, and every 5 years thereafter, the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] shall review its regulations to determine whether any such regulations are outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and shall modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them in accordance with such review. In reviewing any regulation (including, notwithstanding paragraph (6), a regulation issued in accordance with formal rulemaking provisions) that subjects issuers with a public float of $250,000,000 or less to the attestation and reporting requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/7262 15 U.S.C. 7262(b)] ), the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] shall specifically take into account the large burden of such regulation when compared to the benefit of such regulation.

===(5) Post-adoption impact assessment– ===



====(A) In general– ====

Whenever the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] adopts or amends a regulation designated as a “major rule” within the meaning of [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/804 section 804(2)of title 5, United States Code] , it shall state, in its adopting release, the following:
:(i) The purposes and intended consequences of the regulation.
:(ii) Appropriate post-implementation quantitative and qualitative metrics to measure the economic impact of the regulation and to measure the extent to which the regulation has accomplished the stated purposes.
:(iii) The assessment plan that will be used, consistent with the requirements of subparagraph (B)and under the supervision of the Chief Economist of the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] , to assess whether the regulation has achieved the stated purposes.
:(iv) Any unintended or negative consequences that the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] foresees may result from the regulation.
