={{anchor|H086C0BA9D69A4A88A0C5A5BAC275B289}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “American
			 Fighter Aces Congressional Gold Medal Act”.

={{anchor|H802F616E40584DB2BDBD620280A7300E}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) An American
			 Fighter Ace is a fighter pilot who has served honorably in a United States
			 military service and who has destroyed 5 or more confirmed enemy aircraft in
			 aerial combat during a war or conflict in which American armed forces have
			 participated.
:(2) Beginning with
			 World War I, and the first use of airplanes in warfare, military services have
			 maintained official records of individual aerial victory credits during every
			 major conflict. Of more than 60,000 United States military fighter pilots that
			 have taken to the air, less than 1,500 have become Fighter Aces.
:(3) Americans became
			 Fighter Aces in the Spanish Civil War, Sino-Japanese War, Russian Civil War,
			 Arab-Israeli War, and others. Additionally, American military groups’ recruited
			 United States military pilots to form the American Volunteer Group, Eagle
			 Squadron, and others that produced American-born Fighter Aces fighting against
			 axis powers prior to Pearl Harbor.
:(4) The concept of a
			 Fighter Ace is that they fought for freedom and democracy across the globe,
			 flying in the face of the enemy to defend freedom throughout the history of
			 aerial combat. American-born citizens became Fighter Aces flying under the flag
			 of United States allied countries and became some of the highest scoring
			 Fighter Aces of their respective wars.
:(5) American Fighter
			 Aces hail from every State in the Union, representing numerous ethnic,
			 religious, and cultural backgrounds.
:(6) Fighter Aces
			 possess unique skills that have made them successful in aerial combat. These
			 include courage, judgment, keen marksmanship, concentration, drive,
			 persistence, and split-second thinking that makes an Ace a war fighter with
			 unique and valuable flight driven skills.
:(7) The Aces’
			 training, bravery, skills, sacrifice, attention to duty, and innovative spirit
			 illustrate the most celebrated traits of the United States military, including
			 service to country and the protection of freedom and democracy.
:(8) American Fighter
			 Aces have led distinguished careers in the military, education, private
			 enterprise, and politics. Many have held the rank of General or Admiral and
			 played leadership roles in multiple war efforts from WWI to Vietnam through
			 many decades. In some cases they became the highest ranking officers for
			 following wars.
:(9) The extraordinary
			 heroism of the American Fighter Ace boosted American morale at home and
			 encouraged many men and women to enlist to fight for America and democracy
			 across the globe.
:(10) Fighter Aces were
			 among America’s most-prized military fighters during wars. When they rotated
			 back to the United States after combat tours, they trained cadets in fighter
			 pilot tactics that they had learned over enemy skies. The teaching of combat
			 dogfighting to young aviators strengthened our fighter pilots to become more
			 successful in the skies. The net effect of this was to shorten wars and save
			 the lives of young Americans.
:(11) Following
			 military service, many Fighter Aces became test pilots due to their superior
			 flying skills and quick thinking abilities.
:(12) Richard Bong was
			 America’s top Ace of all wars scoring a confirmed 40 enemy victories in WWII.
			 He was from Poplar, Wisconsin, and flew the P–38 Lightning in all his combat
			 sorties flying for the 49th Fighter Group. He was killed in 1945 during a P–80
			 test flight in which the engine flamed out on takeoff.
:(13) The American
			 Fighter Aces are one of the most decorated military groups in American history.
			 Twenty-two Fighter Aces have achieved the rank of Admiral in the Navy.
			 Seventy-nine Fighter Aces have achieved the rank of General in the Army,
			 Marines, and Air Force. Nineteen Medals of Honor have been awarded to
			 individual Fighter Aces.
:(14) The American
			 Fighter Aces Association has existed for over 50 years as the primary
			 organization with which the Aces have preserved their history and told their
			 stories to the American public. The Association established and maintains the
			 Outstanding Cadet in Airmanship Award presented annually at the [[Wikipedia:|United States
			 Air Force Academy]]; established and maintains an awards program for outstanding
			 fighter pilot “lead-in” trainee graduates from the Air Force,
			 Navy, and Marine Corps; and sponsors a scholarship program for descendants of
			 American Fighter Aces.
