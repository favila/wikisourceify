<blockquote> 
::(b) The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]is authorized to enter into leases of power privileges for electric power generation in connection with any project constructed under this Act, and shall have authority in addition to and alternative to any authority in existing laws related to particular projects, including small conduit hydropower development, consistent with the terms of this Act, the  Reclamation Project Act of 1939 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/485h 43 U.S.C. 485h]), and other Federal reclamation laws. 
::(c) When carrying out this section, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall first offer the lease of power privilege to an irrigation district or water users association operating the applicable transferred conduit, or to the irrigation district or water users association receiving water from the applicable reserved conduit. The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall determine a reasonable timeframe for the irrigation district or water users association to accept or reject a lease of power privilege offer. If the irrigation district or water users association elects not to accept a lease of power privilege offer under paragraph (1) , the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall offer the lease of power privilege to other parties in accordance with this section. 
::(d) The [[w:United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]]shall apply its categorical exclusion process under the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/4321 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] )to small conduit hydropower development under this section, excluding siting of associated transmission facilities on Federal lands. 
::(e) Nothing in this section shall obligate the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Western Area Power Administration]]or the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Bonneville Power Administration]]to purchase or market any of the power produced by the facilities covered under this section and none of the costs associated with production or delivery of such power shall be assigned to project purposes for inclusion in project rates. 
::(f) Nothing in this section shall alter or impede the delivery and management of water by [[w:United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]]facilities, as water used for conduit hydropower generation shall be deemed incidental to use of water for the original project purposes. Lease of power privilege shall be made only when, in the judgment of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]], the exercise of the lease will not be incompatible with the purposes of the project or division involved and shall not create any unmitigated financial or physical impacts to the project or division involved. The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall notify and consult with the irrigation district or legally organized water users association operating the transferred conduit in advance of offering the lease of power privilege and shall prescribe such terms and conditions necessary to adequately protect the planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and other interests of the United States and the project or division involved.
