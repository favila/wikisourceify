Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in developing the methodology for the designation of frontier and remote areas published in the Federal Register on May 5, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 25599), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]]shallâ€”
:(1) designate as a frontier area any area in Hawaii or Alaska that is defined or designated as rural under the law of the respective State for purposes of determining whether the area qualifies as rural for a Federal program; and
:(2) include, in addition to the frontier and remote area levels otherwise defined pursuant to such methodology, a level (developed in accordance with a process established by the Secretary) for areas that have unique characteristics (such as being geographically isolated) that should qualify such areas for such designation.
