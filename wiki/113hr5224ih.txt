{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a scholarship program to increase the availability of physicians who provide primary health care services at medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Restoring the Doctors of Our Country through Scholarships Veterans Affairs Act of 2014   ”or the“  RDOCS–VA Act of 2014  ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) Medical facilities of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]are in dire need of more physicians, with a particular need for doctors trained in primary care specialties.
:(2) The Health Professionals Educational Assistance Program established by chapter 76 of title 38, United States Code, provides educational assistance through scholarships and loan forgiveness for a range of health professionals, however, it does not specifically encourage a commitment to primary care by physicians employed by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]].
:(3) The Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) model of education and training is a respected and effective way of meeting the need of the United States for educated and trained officers in the Armed Forces, and it can be applied to train and educate physicians to provide primary care services.
:(4) Congress can build off of the Health Professionals Educational Assistance Program and the ROTC model to solve the primary care shortage by providing full-tuition scholarships to students committed to serving the United States as primary care doctors at the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]].
