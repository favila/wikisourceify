{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 18, United States Code, to safeguard data stored abroad from improper government access, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   The Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The  Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 ( [[Public Law 99-508|Public Law 99–508]]  ;100 Stat. 1848)(referred to in this section as“  ECPA  ”) was intended to protect the privacy of electronic communications stored with providers of electronic communications services and remote computing services, while balancing the legitimate needs of law enforcement to access records stored by such providers.
:(2) To strike this balance, ECPA authorized governmental entities to obtain certain categories of communications data from providers using established, pre-existing forms of process—warrants and subpoenas. It also created a new form of court order, in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703  section 2703(d)of title 18, United States Code], that governmental entities could use to obtain additional types of communications data.
:(3) It has been well established that courts in the United States lack the power to issue warrants authorizing extraterritorial searches and seizures, and neither ECPA nor subsequent amendments extended the warrant power of courts in the United States beyond the territorial reach of the United States.
:(4) Nevertheless, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]also recognizes the legitimate needs of law enforcement agencies in the United States to obtain, through lawful process, electronic communications relevant to criminal investigations related to United States persons wherever that content may be stored. Therefore, this Act authorizes the use of search warrants extraterritorially only where the Government seeks to obtain the contents of electronic communications belonging to a United States person.
