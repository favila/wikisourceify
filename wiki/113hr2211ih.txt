The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) A reduction in a consumer’s credit score can impede consumers’ economic activity and consumer borrowing capacity.
:(2) A 2012 Federal Trade Commission report found that as many as 40 million Americans have mistakes on their credit report.
:(3) According to credit evaluators, medical debt collections are inconsistently reported, and of questionable value in predicting future payment performance.
:(4) Medical debt that has been completely paid off or settled will remain on a consumer’s credit report and can significantly damage a consumer’s credit score for 7 years.
:(5) Creditworthy consumers may be denied credit, pay higher interest rates, or pay higher fees when buying or refinancing a home loan or obtaining credit for credit-related products due to disputed medical debt on their credit reports.
