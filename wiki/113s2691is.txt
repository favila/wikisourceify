The purposes of this subtitle are the following:

:(4) To establish the use of social impact pay for performance contracts to address some of our Nation’s most pressing problems.

:(6) To bring pay-for-performance to the social services sector, allowing the United States to improve the impact and effectiveness of vital social services programs while redirecting inefficient or duplicative spending.
