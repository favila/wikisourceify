{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 100thAnniversary of Fishermen’s Terminal in the Port of Seattle and celebrating Seattle’s rich maritime heritage and its importance to the United States.

Chittenden Locks on the Lake Washington Ship Canal;   Whereas Fishermen’s Terminal is home to the North Pacific Fishing Fleet and provides moorage for 400 commercial fishing vessels and work boats;   Whereas Fishermen's Terminal is critical to the operations of the Port of Seattle, the port of entry for 50 percent of the total seafood caught in the United States;   Whereas there is a strong connection between the fishing and shipping industries of the Port of Seattle, and seafood exported out of the Port of Seattle was valued at more than $997,000,000 in 2012;   Whereas the fishing fleets of Fishermen’s Terminal harvest a wide variety of fish including salmon, halibut, Pacific cod, Alaska Pollock, sablefish, rock fish, whiting, yellowfin, sole, albacore, crab, shrimp, and other shellfish;   Whereas the fishing vessels that moor at Fishermen’s Terminal include crabbers, longliners, purse seiners, trawlers, and trollers, and often fish in Alaskan waters such as Southeast Alaska, Bristol Bay, and the Bering Sea;   Whereas for the last century, Fishermen’s Terminal has played a critical role in the fishing and maritime industry in both Washington and Alaska;   Whereas Fishermen’s Terminal directly contributes and supports maritime jobs, and is a major driver of the maritime economy of the Pacific Northwest, which generates $30,000,000,000 annually for the State of Washington;   Whereas annually, the fishing industry at the Port of Seattle creates 15,600 jobs, has a total payroll of $1,900,000,000 per year, and generates $814,000,000 in annual revenue for private businesses;   Whereas 34,500 Washington residents are employed by the Alaskan seafood industry;   Whereas Fishermen’s Terminal contributes to the economic diversity and resilience of the Pacific Northwest due to the many industries it supports, including vessel construction, maintenance, and repair activity that brings vendors and suppliers together with a network of bankers, insurers, and other businesses that support fishing and shipping;   Whereas much of the infrastructure and businesses surrounding Fishermen’s Terminal have been in place as long as the Terminal, and make up the most important economic maritime cluster of fish processing, cold storage, vessel fabrication, and barge and tug operations businesses in the United States;   Whereas the shore side support businesses surrounding Fishermen's Terminal employ a wide range of machinists, trade workers, and artisans who are skilled in traditional maritime crafts such as wood-working, fiberglass repair, painting, sail making, brass brightworking, marine engineering, and naval architecture;   Whereas Fishermen's Terminal is more than just a place to moor, repair, and maintain boats, and gives the Seattle community a sense of identity as a place where people work with their hands in industries that help define the region; and   Whereas Fishermen’s Terminal is a cultural resource that is always open to the public, is home to the Fishermen's Memorial, a towering bronze sculpture that lists the names of 675 men and women who have lost their lives in their pursuit of the bounty of the sea, hosts thousands of people every September for the Fishermen’s Fall Festival to celebrate the homecoming of Washington fishermen after a summer at sea, and is surrounded by lively restaurants, shops, and businesses that support the community and those in the fishing industry: Now, therefore, be it
