{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating July 2014 as“Summer Meals Awareness Month”.    Whereas 1 in 5 children in the United States struggle with hunger;   Whereas research has found that more than 30 percent of low-income families do not have enough food during the summer months;   Whereas the summer food service program for children established under  section 13 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1761 42 U.S.C. 1761] )exists to ensure that low-income children have access to adequate nutrition when the school year ends;   Whereas the summer food service program is designed to give hungry children a safe place to participate in fun, educational activities and to receive a meal;   Whereas thousands of schools and nonprofit organizations across the country serve as summer food service program sites;   Whereas summer programs are often under-utilized, as only 1 in 6 eligible children participate in the summer food service program, due in part to families being unaware that the summer food service program exists;   Whereas lack of transportation and other barriers often prevent children from accessing the summer food service program sites, especially in rural areas; and   Whereas almost 1 in 3 low-income children live in communities that are not eligible to participate in the summer food service program, thus reducing their ability to participate in the program: Now, therefore, be it
