{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for tax preferred savings accounts for individuals under age 18, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Young Savers Security in Retirement Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Studies indicate that children as young as 3 years old are able to grasp financial concepts and that basic financial habits are largely formulated by age 7.
:(2) Research shows that children born to low-income parents who are good financial savers are more likely to move up the economic ladder than children from low-income households that do not save. According to a 2011 study controlled for income and demographic factors, youth who own financial accounts are 7 times more likely to attend college.
:(3) If tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as Roth IRAs could be opened for children between the ages of zero and 18, these individuals are likely to acquire substantially more tax-free assets by retirement age than their peers.
:(4) Children who possess retirement accounts from a young age will benefit from longer exposure to compound interest and can be expected to attain higher levels of financial literacy, college graduation and retirement security in adulthood.
:(5) Greater private retirement savings for Americans of all ages will increase personal financial security and responsibility, reducing the likelihood that seniors will need to rely solely on Social Security for their retirement income.
:(6) Federal policy should better enable parents, guardians and families of all income levels to encourage youth saving and investment for retirement at an earlier age.
:(7) Federal policy should help create retirement savings incentives for low-income Americans because studies show that low-income Americans will save more for retirement if there are incentives and structures in place to help them do so. A refundable incentive like the Saver’s Credit would reach 50 million low-income households—nearly 10 times the number a non-refundable credit reaches.
