{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Celebrating Black History Month.Whereas, in 1776, the United States of America was imagined, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new nation dedicated to the proposition that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”;Whereas, on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln, in reference to the Declaration of Independence, stated, “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” ;Whereas the history of the United States includes injustices and the denial of basic, fundamental rights at odds with the words of the founders of the United States and the sacrifices commemorated at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania;Whereas the injustices committed in the United States include approximately 250 years of slavery, 100 years of lynchings, denial of both fundamental human and civil rights, and withholding of the basic rights of citizenship;Whereas inequalities and injustices in our society still exist today;Whereas Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, W.E.B. Dubois, Booker T. Washington, Charles Hamilton Houston, the Tuskegee Airmen, Lena Horne, Ralph Bunche, Jackie Robinson, Constance Baker Motley, James Baldwin, Dorothy Height, Thurgood Marshall, and Shirley Chisholm each lived a life of incandescent greatness while many African Americans lived, toiled, and died in obscurity, never achieving the recognition they deserved, but paved the way for future generations to succeed;Whereas many African-American men and women worked against racism to achieve success, such as James Beckwourth, Bill Pickett, Colonel Allen Allensworth, Clara Brown, and many others who were pivotal in the exploration and westward expansion of the United States;Whereas pioneers such as David Dinkins, Mae Jemison, Arthur Ashe, Oprah Winfrey, James Earl Jones, Clarence Thomas, Ursula Burns, Alice Walker, Ronald Brown, Alexis Herman, Kenneth Chenault, and Magic Johnson have all served as positive beneficiaries of our forefathers and as great role models and leaders for future generations;Whereas, on November 4, 2008, and again on November 6, 2012, the people of the United States elected an African-American man,
[[w:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]] , as President of the United States, and African Americans continue to serve the United States at the highest levels of the government and Armed Forces;Whereas Carter G. Woodson, the “Father of Black History” , stated, “We have a wonderful history behind us. . . .  If you are unable to demonstrate to the world that you have this record, the world will say to you, “You are not worthy to enjoy the blessings of democracy or anything else.” ” ;Whereas Black History Month, celebrated during the month of February, dates back to 1926 when Carter G. Woodson set aside a special period of time in February to recognize the heritage and achievement of black Americans;Whereas, on February 22, 2012,
[[w:Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] and First Lady Michelle Obama, along with former First Lady Laura Bush, celebrated the groundbreaking of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.;Whereas Hiram Rhodes Revels, Blanche Kelso Bruce, Edward William Brooke, Carol Moseley Braun,
