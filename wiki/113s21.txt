			 the “Cybersecurity and American Cyber
			 Competitiveness Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|ID939283ef360a4d35a47e0ce071019da0}}Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress makes the following
			 findings:
:(1) The country's
			 leading officials in business, intelligence, and defense affairs agree that
			 malicious state, terrorist, and criminal actors exploiting vulnerabilities in
			 information and communications networks and gaps in cybersecurity pose one of
			 the most serious and rapidly growing threats to both the national security and
			 the economy of the United States.
:(2) With information
			 technology now the backbone of the United States economy, a critical element of
			 United States national security infrastructure and defense systems, the primary
			 foundation of global communications, and a key enabler of most critical
			 infrastructure, nearly every single United States citizen is touched by
			 cyberspace and is threatened by cyber attacks.
:(3) Malicious actors
			 in cyberspace have already caused significant damage to the United States
			 Government, the United States economy, and United States citizens, and the
			 threat continues to grow.
:(4) In its 2009
			 Cyberspace Policy Review, the White House concluded, “Ensuring that
			 cyberspace is sufficiently resilient and trustworthy to support U.S. goals of
			 economic growth, civil liberties and privacy protections, national security,
			 and the continued advancement of democratic institutions requires making
			 cybersecurity a national priority.”.
:(5) Leading experts
			 in the private sector and the government agree that the United States should
			 establish a new model of public-private collaboration, which fits the realities
			 of the 21st century, to secure the country against cyber attack.
