{{Center|A BILL}}

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Breath of Fresh Air Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) 25,000,000 people, including 7,000,000 children, have asthma.
:(2) Almost 13,000,000 people report having an asthma attack in the past year and asthma accounts for nearly 2,000,000 emergency department visits each year.
:(3) Every day in the United States—
::(A) 30,000 people have an asthma attack; and
::(B) 11 people die from asthma.
:(4) Nearly 5,000,000 asthma sufferers are under 18 years of age, and 1 out of every 10 school-aged children has asthma.
:(5) Minorities are adversely affected by asthma, as—
::(A) African-Americans are 3 times more likely to die from asthma; and
::(B) Hispanics may have an elevated risk for exposure to air pollution since a disproportionate number live in areas failing to meet one or more national standards for air pollutants. (It is estimated that 80 percent of Hispanics live in areas that failed to meet one United States Environmental Protection Agency air quality standard, compared to 65 percent of African-Americans and 57 percent of Whites.)
