Calling on the United States Senate to increase sanctions against Iran.Whereas Iran continues to pose a threat to the United States through its pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, work on its ballistic missile program, and state sponsorship of terrorism;Whereas on July 31, 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act of 2013, H.R. 850, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 400–20–1;Whereas this legislation highlights the devastating threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the United States, United States allies, and United States interests globally;Whereas Israel is a vital ally of the United States;Whereas Iran, which rejects Israel’s right to exist, is a continued threat to the safety and security of the United States and Israel, both through its support of terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and through its ongoing efforts to acquire nuclear weapons;Whereas Iran has threatened to “<nowiki>wipe [Israel] off the map</nowiki>” , in violation of article 2, paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter;Whereas Iran possesses ballistic missiles that can reach Israel and is working to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the United States;Whereas Iran has constructed a large explosives containment vessel at the Parchin military complex and the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has requested to inspect this complex for traces of weaponization research;Whereas the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] issued a report exposing Iran’s nuclear intentions and in November 2011 concluded that “<nowiki>contrary to the relevant resolutions of the Board of Governors and the Security Council, Iran has not suspended its [nuclear] enrichment related activities</nowiki>” and continues to proceed with a nuclear weapons proliferation program, and the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] Board of Governors has issued 10 resolutions condemning Iran’s nuclear program;Whereas the [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]] has required Iran to cooperate fully with the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA’s]] investigation into its nuclear activities, suspend its uranium enrichment program, suspend its construction of a heavy-water reactor and related projects, and ratify the Additional Protocol to its [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] safeguards agreement;Whereas Iran, in violation of multiple [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]] resolutions, has continued to enrich uranium, continued work on its heavy-water reactor and related projects, and has not ratified the Additional Protocol to its [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] safeguards agreement;Whereas multiple rounds of tough sanctions have been effective in bringing Iran to the negotiating table and the threat of increased sanctions has the ability to compel Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions; andWhereas the P5+1 interim agreement will not prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability: Now, therefore, be it
