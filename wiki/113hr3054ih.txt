{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a health and education grant program related to autism spectrum disorders, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Global Autism Assistance Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has increased during the past decade from an estimated one in 500 to an estimated one in 110, according to data released by the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in December 2009. CDC classified as suffering from ASD children whose behaviors were consistent with the DSM–IV–TR criteria for Autistic Disorder, Asperger Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder—Not Otherwise Specified (PDD–NOS).
:(2) Autism is a complex neurological disorder that affects an individual in the areas of social interaction and communication. Because it is a spectrum disorder, it affects each individual differently and to varying degrees of severity. People with autism process and respond to information in unique ways. In some cases, coexisting medical issues and aggressive or self-injurious behavior may be present.
:(3) The increased number of children diagnosed with autism is a growing and urgent concern for families, healthcare professionals, and educators, as the health and education systems struggle to respond to the needs of this population in a comprehensive manner.
:(4) The prevalence of autism in developing countries is also growing rapidly, and health and education systems in these countries are particularly ill-equipped to deal with these issues. According to the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] , tens of millions of individuals in Africa are affected by autism.
:(5) Children with autism who receive intensive and appropriate educational services before age five often make significant functional improvements. In the United States, significant efforts are being pursued to expand early diagnosis and the provision of these services. In a report on the identification, evaluation and management of children with autism, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in November 2007 that all children should be screened for autism twice by the age of two, even if they have no symptoms. Early screening and services for autism are sorely lacking in most of the developing world. An opportunity exists to use United States expertise to significantly aid children and families in developing countries, for relatively small costs.
