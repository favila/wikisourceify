=={{anchor|HA132F4C872374E89B7C67051ECFFBE5D}}(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“Election Assistance Commission Termination Act”.

=={{anchor|HF61B3B20683B4692974E54AB4044DDFB}}(b) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Help America Vote Act of 2002(HAVA) authorized annual appropriations of not more than $10,000,000 for the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|Election Assistance Commission]] (EAC) for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005. Funding for additional years has not been authorized, and in fiscal year 2011 the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC’s]] budget grew to nearly $18,000,000.
:(2) Between 2007 and 2011, the number of staff at the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] grew from 26 to 48 without an increase in statutory responsibility.
:(3) 55 percent of the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC’s]] fiscal year 2014 budget request is devoted to management costs, the third consecutive year for which management costs have exceeded one-half of the EAC’s budget.
:(4) The [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] has distributed more than $3.2 billion in election reform grants to the States. The most recent year for which appropriations for these grants were enacted or were requested in the President’s annual budget was fiscal year 2010.
:(5) The [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] last issued voluntary voting system guidelines in 2005. A total of 11 voting systems currently hold a certification from the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] .
:(6) The research division of the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] has substantially completed the reports required by HAVA.
:(7) The National Association of Secretaries of State adopted resolutions calling for the dissolution of the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] in 2005 and 2010.
:(8) The EAC has not had a quorum of commissioners since December 2010, and has not had any commissioners since December 2011. The [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] has not had an Executive Director since December 2011, and has not had a General Counsel since May 2012.
:(9) The existence of the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] is not necessary to the conduct of Federal elections and is an unnecessary expenditure of taxpayer funds. Any functions of the [[w:Election Assistance Commission|EAC]] worth continuing can be performed by other government entities, consortia of government entities, or private associations.
