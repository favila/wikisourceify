{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the month of September 2014 as “National Sepsis Awareness Month”.    Whereas sepsis is a medical condition resulting from an immune system response to an infection;   Whereas the overwhelming flood of immune chemicals released into the blood to fight an infection can impair blood flow, injuring organs;   Whereas sepsis is a serious community-acquired infection and a leading cause of death in the United States;   Whereas in severe cases of sepsis, a patient can experience a drop in blood pressure, a weakened heart, and septic shock, causing potentially fatal multiple organ failure;   Whereas approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United States are infected with sepsis each year;   Whereas sepsis has killed over 4,000,000 individuals in the United States between 2004 and 2014;   Whereas the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]estimates that approximately 50 percent of individuals infected with sepsis die, accounting for more deaths in the United States than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined;   Whereas according to the [[w:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], sepsis is the most expensive cause of hospitalization in the United States, with an annual cost of $24,000,000,000;   Whereas the number of sepsis deaths is on the rise in the United States;   Whereas an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reports that more than 80 percent of individuals who die from sepsis arrive at the hospital with sepsis;   Whereas early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment can prevent sepsis fatalities; and   Whereas September 2014 is an appropriate month to designate as “National Sepsis Awareness Month” to raise awareness of sepsis and encourage educating patients, families, health care professionals, and government agencies on the importance of early detection as the key for patients to survive sepsis: Now, therefore, be it
