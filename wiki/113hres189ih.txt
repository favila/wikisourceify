{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Recognizing the significance of Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month in May as an important time to celebrate the significant contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the Nation’s history.Whereas the United States joins together each May to pay tribute to the contributions of generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched the Nation’s history;Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States is inextricably tied to the story of the Nation;Whereas the Asian American and Pacific Islander community is an inherently diverse population, comprised of over 45 distinct ethnicities and over 100 language dialects;Whereas the United States Census Bureau found that the Asian American population grew faster than any other racial or ethnic group over the last decade, surging nearly 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, a growth rate 4 times faster than the total United States population;Whereas the 2010 Census estimated that there are now 17,300,000 United States residents who identify as Asian, and 1,200,000 United States residents who identify themselves as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, making up nearly 6 percent of the total United States population;Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month due to the following two historical events, first, May 7, 1843, when the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States, and second, May 10, 1869, when, with substantial contributions from Chinese immigrants, the first transcontinental railroad was completed;Whereas 2013 marks 70 years since the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Actand 25 years since the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988which granted reparations to Japanese Americans interned during World War II, both cases in which the United States Congress acted to address discriminatory laws that targeted those of Asian descent;Whereas [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/102  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// section 102] of title 36, United States Code] , officially designates May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, and requests the President to issue each year a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities;Whereas the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a bicameral caucus of Members of Congress advocating on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, is composed of 41 Members this year, including 13 Members of Asian or Pacific Islander descent;Whereas the 113th Congress has welcomed a number of historic firsts this year, including Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, the first Asian American woman and first Buddhist to ever serve in the United States Senate, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, the first Thai American woman, first wounded female combat Veteran, and first Asian American from Illinois to serve in Congress, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu American and first Pacific Islander woman to serve in Congress, Rep. Grace Meng, the first Asian American Member of Congress elected to represent the State of New York, and Rep. Mark Takano, the first openly gay person of color to ever serve in Congress;Whereas today, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are serving in State legislatures across the Nation, in States as diverse as Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington;Whereas the number of Asian American and Pacific Islander Article III judges has more than doubled over the past 4 years, reflecting a commitment to diversity in the Federal judiciary that has resulted in the confirmations of high caliber Asian American and Pacific Islander judicial nominees;Whereas there still remains much to be done to ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have access to resources, a voice in the United States Government, and continue to advance in the Nation’s political landscape; andWhereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month provides the people of the United States with an opportunity to recognize the achievements, contributions, history, and address the challenges faced by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: Now, therefore, be it
