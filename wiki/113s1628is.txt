{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide Federal death and disability benefits for contractors who serve as firefighters of the Forest Service, Department of the Interior agencies, or any State or local entity.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Fallen Wildland Firefighters Fair Compensation Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Death and disability benefits for contracted firefighters of the Forest Service, Department of the Interior agencies, or any State or local entity=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Aerial and ground crew firefighters used to fight wildfires often work on a contract basis with a State, local, or Federal agency and, as a result, are not eligible for death or disability benefits should they be killed or injured in the line of duty.
:(2) Employer death benefits and life insurance for exclusive-use firefighters are expensive, and the families of these heroes have to cope not only with the loss of a loved one, but also the additional financial loss of a wage earner.
:(3) It is vital that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] continue to encourage the recruitment and retention of brave, skilled firefighters.

==(b) Eligibility for death and disability benefits– ==
