[[w:|Mr. Coons]] introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to encourage the increased use of performance contracting in Federal facilities.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Energy Savings Through Public-Private Partnerships Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Private sector funding and expertise can help address the energy efficiency challenges facing the United States.
:(2) The Federal Government spends more than $6 billion annually in energy costs.
:(3) Reducing Federal energy costs can help save money, create jobs, and reduce waste.
:(4) Energy savings performance contracts and utility energy service contracts are tools for utilizing private sector investment to upgrade Federal facilities without any up-front cost to the taxpayer.
:(5) Performance contracting is a way to retrofit Federal buildings using private sector investment in the absence of appropriated dollars. Retrofits seek to reduce energy use, improve infrastructure, protect national security, and cut facility operations and maintenance costs.
