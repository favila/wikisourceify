{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating February 28, 2014, as“Rare Disease Day”.    Whereas a rare disease or disorder is one that affects a small number of patients – in the United States, typically less than 200,000 individuals annually;   Whereas as of the date of approval of this resolution, nearly 7,000 rare diseases affect approximately 30,000,000 people in the United States and their families;   Whereas children with rare genetic diseases account for more than half of the population affected by rare diseases in the United States;   Whereas many rare diseases are serious, life-threatening, and lack an effective treatment;   Whereas great strides have been made in research and treatment for rare diseases as a result of the  Orphan Drug Act ( [[Public Law 97-414|Public Law 97–414]]  );   Whereas the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]has made great strides in involving the patient in the drug review process as part of its Patient-Focused Drug Development program, an initiative that originated in the  Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ( [[Public Law 112-144|Public Law 112–144]]  );   Whereas a third of all treatments approved by the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]in 2013 were orphan products intended to treat rare diseases;   Whereas lack of access to effective treatments and difficulty in obtaining reimbursement for life-altering, and even life-saving, treatments still exist and remain significant challenges for the rare disease community and their families;   Whereas rare diseases and conditions include epidermolysis bullosa, progeria, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, many childhood cancers, and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva;   Whereas people with rare diseases experience challenges that include difficulty in obtaining accurate diagnoses, limited treatment options, and difficulty finding physicians or treatment centers with expertise in their diseases;   Whereas the rare disease community made great strides in 2013, including the passage of the  National Pediatric Research Network Act ( [[Public Law 113-55|Public Law 113–55]]  ), which calls special attention to rare diseases and directs the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]]to facilitate greater collaboration among researchers;   Whereas both the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]and the [[w:National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health]]have established special offices to advocate for rare disease research and treatments;   Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an organization established in 1983 to provide services to and advocate on behalf of patients with rare diseases, remains a critical public voice for people with rare diseases;   Whereas 2013 marked the 30th anniversary of the Orphan Drug Act and the National Organization for Rare Disorders;   Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders sponsors Rare Disease Day in the United States to increase public awareness of rare diseases;   Whereas Rare Disease Day is observed each year on the last day of February;   Whereas Rare Disease Day is a global event, first observed in the United States on February 28, 2009, and observed in 60 countries in 2013; and   Whereas Rare Disease Day is expected to be observed globally for years to come, providing hope and information for rare disease patients around the world: Now, therefore, be it
