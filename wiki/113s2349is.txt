 To establish a grant program to enable States to promote participation in dual enrollment programs, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Supporting College Success Through Dual Enrollment Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The future strength of the democracy of the United States, as well as the Nation's economy, depends upon ensuring a highly educated population and a skilled workforce with the knowledge necessary to compete in a globalized economy.
:(2) The [[w:Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor Statistics]]estimates that a majority of the fastest-growing and highest-paying occupations require some form of postsecondary education, be it a 2-year degree, a 4-year degree, or an industry-recognized credential.
:(3) According to research conducted by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, 63 percent of all new job openings by 2018 will require at least some college education.
:(4) The cost of a college education is often the most significant obstacle that many students face in obtaining a college degree. Programs that help students accumulate college credit in high school can help reduce the overall cost of a college degree by as much as 12.5 percent, thus reducing the financial burden on students and taxpayers. Research has found that for every 1,000,000 students entering college with a semester’s worth of credit, overall college expenditures are reduced by $9,500,000,000.
:(5) Although more students begin college today than did 20 years ago, many are not graduating due to substantial challenges in negotiating the transition from high school to college. Fewer than 20 percent of students in grade 9 will graduate with a baccalaureate degree by the age of 24.
:(6) Research conducted by the [[w:United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]has found that postsecondary success is predicated on both rigorous academic preparation and a clear understanding of the expectations in college. The academic intensity of a student’s high school courses is a better predictor of whether a student will complete a bachelor’s degree than class rank, grade point average, or standardized admission test scores.
:(7) According to research conducted at the Teachers’ College at Columbia University, participation in dual enrollment programs is especially beneficial for students who are traditionally underrepresented in higher education, including low-income, first generation, and minority students.
:(8) Students participating in dual enrollment programs have better academic outcomes. Research conducted in Florida, New York, and California found that students in dual enrollment programs were, on average, more likely to graduate from high school, transition into a 4-year institution of higher education, persist in postsecondary education, and have a higher postsecondary grade point average, as demonstrated by the following:
::(A) Participants in New York City's dual enrollment program, College Now, were more likely than their peers to pursue a baccalaureate degree and had higher grade point averages than nonparticipants. Further, there was a positive correlation between participation in dual enrollment and completion of a baccalaureate degree.
::(B) Florida’s dual enrollment program participants were 4.3 percent more likely than their peers to earn a high school diploma and 7.7 percent more likely to enroll in a 4-year institution of higher education, and earned, on average, 15.1 more college credits than nonparticipants.
::(C) In Missouri, dual enrollment students had an 89 percent likelihood of returning for their second year of college, compared to 76 percent for students who entered college with no previous college credit.
