{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing September 2014 as“National Campus Safety Awareness Month”and supporting the goals and ideals of National Campus Safety Awareness Month.    Whereas people on college and university campuses are not immune from the potential acts of crime that the rest of society in the United States faces;   Whereas men and women deserve to learn in a positive and safe environment free from sexual assault;   Whereas experts estimate that 1 in 5 female undergraduate students will experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault;   Whereas the aggressor in a sexual assault is usually an acquaintance or friend of the victim;   Whereas a majority of sexual assaults are not reported to law enforcement;   Whereas the majority of stalking victims are between the ages of 18 and 24 years old;   Whereas approximately 3 in 10 women are injured emotionally or psychologically from being stalked;   Whereas the Clery Center for Security on Campus, a nonprofit group dedicated to preventing violence, substance abuse, and other crimes on college and university campuses, has designated September as“National Campus Safety Awareness Month”; and   Whereas National Campus Safety Awareness Month provides an opportunity for campus communities to become engaged in efforts to improve campus safety: Now, therefore, be it
