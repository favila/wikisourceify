{{section|H636915FF9C59453297A0492118E7DE60|1. Hunting in Kisatchie National Forest}}
(a)
In
			 general
Consistent with the
			 Act of June 4, 1897
 (16 U.S.C. 551
)
, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] may not
			 restrict the use of dogs in deer hunting activities in Kisatchie National
			 Forest, unless such restrictions—
(1)
apply to the
			 smallest practicable portions of such unit; and

(2)
are necessary to
			 reduce or control trespass onto land adjacent to such unit.


(b)
Prior
			 restrictions void
Any
			 restrictions regarding the use of dogs in deer hunting activities in Kisatchie
			 National Forest in force on the date of the enactment of this Act shall be void
			 and have no force or effect.

(c)
Adjacent
			 landowners
Landowners whose
			 property abuts a unit of the Kisatchie National Forest may petition the
			 [[United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] to restrict the use of dogs in deer hunting activities
			 that take place on such units which abut their property. If the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of
			 Agriculture]] receives a petition from an adjacent landowner, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary]],
			 after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may impose restrictions on the use
			 of dogs in deer hunting—
(1)
limited to those
			 units of the Kisatchie National Forest within 300 yards of the boundary of the
			 petitioning landowner’s property; and

(2)
consistent with
			 subsection (a)
