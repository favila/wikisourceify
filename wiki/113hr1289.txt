={{anchor|H121C516E2BB14680BE8223F0FA746833}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“National Fab Lab Network Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H8B1B7B43CEAB4C17BDBCD2D6D592A2C6}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Scientific discoveries and technical innovations are critical to the economic and national security of the United States.
:(2) Maintaining the leadership of the United States in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will require a diverse population with the skills, interest, and access to tools required to advance these fields.
:(3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in communications and computation provided individuals with the Internet and personal computers, a digital revolution in fabrication will allow anyone to make almost anything, anywhere.
:(4) The Center for Bits and Atoms of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CBA) has contributed significantly to the advancement of these goals through its work in creating and advancing digital fab labs in the United States and abroad.
:(5) CBA’s fab labs provide a model for a new kind of national laboratory that links local facilities for advanced manufacturing to expand access and empower communities.
:(6) A coordinated national public-private partnership will be the most effective way to accelerate the provision of this infrastructure for learning skills, developing inventions, creating businesses, and producing personalized products.
