{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week of September 15 through September 19, 2014, as ‘‘National Health Information Technology Week’’ to recognize the value of health information technology in transforming and improving the health care system for all individuals in the United States.    Whereas health information technology is recognized as an essential tool for improving patient care, ensuring patient safety, stopping duplicative tests and paperwork, and reducing health care costs;   Whereas the Center for Information Technology Leadership estimates that a fully-realized implementation of national standards for interoperability and the exchange of health information can produce significant savings in health care costs;   Whereas the use of health information technology is essential to providing coordinated care, expanding access to care, and improving the quality and safety of mental and physical health care for all individuals in the United States;   Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has a vision for a national technology-enabled health care system that— 
:(1) provides access to care that is available at anytime and anywhere; 
:(2) recognizes modern, multimodal health care delivery models; 
:(3) establishes open standards for connectivity to core patient information between health information technology systems, devices, and emerging technologies; and 
:(4) leverages technology solutions to analyze and improve treatment trends and highlight cost transparency to help combat fraud, waste, and abuse within Federal health programs;   Whereas portable health information, such as cloud-based computing and storage systems that can process vast amounts of patient information for personalized care, integrated consumer devices, and mobile medical applications, are critical technologies for improving the health of all individuals in the United States, creating high-demand jobs, and stimulating market innovation;   Whereas it is necessary to continue improving the exchange of health information confidently and securely between different providers, systems, and insurers, a task that is foundational to transforming the health care delivery system in the United States;   Whereas aligning the use of electronic health records with other reporting efforts is critical to improving clinical outcomes for patients, controlling costs, and expanding access to care through the use of technology; and   Whereas since 2006, organizations across the United States have united to support National Health Information Technology Week to improve public awareness of implementing health information technology to achieve the benefits of improved quality and cost efficiency in the health care system: Now, therefore, be it

:(2) recognizes the value of information technology and management systems in transforming health care for individuals in the United States;
