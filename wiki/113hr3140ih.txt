{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit any regulation under such Act concerning the emissions of carbon dioxide from a fossil fuel-fired electric generating unit from taking effect until the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency makes certain certifications, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Ensure Reliable and Affordable American Energy Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. No unilateral regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide=

The Clean Air Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7401 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] )is amended by inserting after section 329the following:

<blockquote>

=Sec. 330. No unilateral regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units=



==(a) Prohibition on regulations concerning emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-Fired electric generating units taking effect– ==



===(1) Prohibition– ===

A regulation under this Act concerning emissions of carbon dioxide from a fossil fuel-fired electric generating unit to address climate change may not take effect until the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] certifies that a sufficient number of countries have put into effect regulations concerning emissions of carbon dioxide which are at least as stringent as the regulation under this Act.

===(2) Countries– ===

For the purposes of paragraph (1), the term sufficient number means a sufficient number of countries so that, in the aggregate, such countries account for not less than 80 percent of the global carbon dioxide emissions, excluding such emissions in the United States, in the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the regulation under this Act would be enforced.

===(3) Stringency considerations– ===

For the purposes of paragraph (1), a country’s regulation concerning carbon dioxide emissions may only be considered to be as stringent as the regulation under this Act if such country’s regulation limits carbon dioxide emissions to a numeric standard that is equal to or less than such a standard under the regulation under this Act in a timeframe that is equal to or less than the timeframe under the regulation under this Act.

==(b) Rule of Construction– ==

Nothing in this section shall be construed as providing the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] with any authority to promulgate any regulation concerning, take action relating to, or take into consideration the emissions of carbon dioxide..
