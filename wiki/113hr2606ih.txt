=Sec. 3. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Responsibilities for overseas stability and reconstruction operations are divided among several Federal agencies. As a result, lines of responsibility and accountability are not well-defined.
:(2) Despite the establishment of the [[w:United States Department of State|Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization within the Department of State]], the reaffirmation of the Coordinator’s mandate by the National Security Presidential Directive 44, its codification in  title XVI of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 ( [[Public Law 110-417|Public Law 110–417]]  ), the issuance of the Department of Defense Directive 3000.05, and the creation of the [[w:United States Department of State|Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization by the Department of State]], serious imbalances and insufficient interagency coordination remain.
:(3) The United States has not effectively or efficiently managed stabilization and reconstruction operations during recent decades.
:(4) Based on recent history, the United States will likely continue to find its involvement necessary in stabilization and reconstruction operations in foreign countries in the wake of violence.
:(5) The United States has not adequately applied the lessons of its recent experiences in stabilization and reconstruction operations, and despite efforts to improve its performance is not yet organized institutionally to respond appropriately to the need to perform stabilization and reconstruction operations in foreign countries.
:(6) The failure to implement the lessons learned of past stabilization and reconstruction operations will lead to further inefficiencies, resulting in greater human and financial costs.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are to—
:(1) protect the national security interests of the United States by providing an effective means to plan for and execute stabilization and reconstruction operations in foreign countries;
:(2) provide for unity of command, and thus achieve unity of effort, in the planning and execution of stabilization and reconstruction operations;
:(3) provide accountability for resources dedicated to stabilization and reconstruction operations;
:(4) maximize the efficient use of resources, which would lead to budget savings, eliminated redundancy in functions, and improvement in the management of stabilization and reconstruction operations; and
:(5) establish an entity to plan for stabilization and reconstruction operations across relevant Federal departments and agencies, including the [[w:|Department of Defense]], the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]], and the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]], and, when directed by the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]], coordinate and execute such operations, eventually returning responsibility for such operations to other Federal departments and agencies of the United States Government as the situation at issue becomes normalized. 

=Sec. 4. Effective date=

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
