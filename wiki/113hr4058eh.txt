=Sec. 3. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) Recent reports on sex trafficking estimate that thousands of children are at risk for domestic sex trafficking.
:(2) The risk is compounded every year for the up to 30,000 young people who are emancipated from foster care.
:(3) The current child welfare system does not effectively identify, prevent, or intervene when a child presents as trafficked or at risk for trafficking.
:(4) Within the foster care system, many young adults are housed in congregate care facilities or group homes, which often are targeted by traffickers.
:(5) Within the foster care system, children are routinely denied the opportunity to participate in normal, age or developmentally-appropriate activities such as joining 4–H and other clubs, participating in school plays, playing sports, going to camp, and visiting a friend.
:(6) A lack of normalcy and barriers to participation in age or developmentally-appropriate activities contribute to increased vulnerability to trafficking, homelessness, and other negative outcomes for children in foster care.
:(7) The latest research in adolescent brain development indicates that young people learn through experience and through trial and error, and that as part of healthy brain development young people need to take on increasing levels of decisionmaking through their teenage years.
:(8) In order to combat domestic sex trafficking and to improve outcomes for children in foster care, systemic changes need to be made to the child welfare system that focus on—
::(A) the reduction of children in long-term foster care;
::(B) greater child engagement in case planning while in foster care;
::(C) improved efforts to locate and respond to children who have run away from foster care and to reduce the number of foster children who are on the run;
::(D) improved policies and procedures that encourage age or developmentally-appropriate activities for children in foster care and that permit more opportunities for such children to make meaningful and permanent connections with caring adults; and
::(E) with regard to domestic sex trafficking, improved identification, prevention, and intervention by the child welfare agency in collaboration with the courts, State and local law enforcement agencies, schools, juvenile justice agencies, and other social service providers.
