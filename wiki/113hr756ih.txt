The development of standards, reference materials, and checklists under paragraph (1)for an information technology hardware or software system or tool does not—
:(A) require any Federal agency to select the specific settings or options recommended by the standard, reference material, or checklist for the system;
:(B) establish conditions or prerequisites for Federal agency procurement or deployment of any such system;
:(C) imply an endorsement of any such system by the [[w:National Institute of Standards and Technology|Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology]] ; or
:(D) preclude any Federal agency from procuring or deploying other information technology hardware or software systems for which no such standard, reference material, or checklist has been developed or identified under paragraph (1)..
