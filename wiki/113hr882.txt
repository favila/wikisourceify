			 responsibility determination
The head of any executive agency, in
			 evaluating any offer received in response to a solicitation issued by the
			 agency for bids or proposals for a contract, shall consider a certification
			 that the offeror has a seriously delinquent tax debt to be definitive proof
			 that the offeror is not a responsible source as defined in section 113 of title
			 41, United States Code
.

(c)
Debarment
(1)
Requirement
Except
			 as provided in paragraph (2)
, the head of an executive agency shall propose a

authorizing the
			 [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to disclose to the head of the executive agency
			 information limited to describing whether the person has a seriously delinquent
			 tax debt.


(b)
Impact on
			 determination of financial stability
The head of any executive
			 agency, in evaluating any application for a grant offered by the agency, shall
			 consider a certification that the grant applicant has a seriously delinquent
			 tax debt to be definitive proof that the applicant is high-risk and, if the
			 applicant is awarded the grant, shall take appropriate measures under
			 guidelines issued by the [[Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management and Budget]] for enhanced oversight
			 of high-risk grantees.
