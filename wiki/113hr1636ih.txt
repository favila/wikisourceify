This Act may be cited as the“Federal Election Integrity Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H8C8225B4E01B4B76A7E09DC661548214}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) chief State election administration officials have served on political campaigns for Federal candidates whose elections those officials will supervise;
:(2) such partisan activity by the chief State election administration official, an individual charged with certifying the validity of an election, represents a fundamental conflict of interest that may prevent the official from ensuring a fair and accurate election;
:(3) this conflict impedes the legal duty of chief State election administration officials to supervise Federal elections, undermines the integrity of Federal elections, and diminishes the people’s confidence in our electoral system by casting doubt on the results of Federal elections;
:(4) the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has long recognized that Congress’s power to regulate Congressional elections under Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution is both plenary and powerful; and
:(5) the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and numerous appellate courts have recognized that the broad power given to Congress over Congressional elections extends to Presidential elections.
