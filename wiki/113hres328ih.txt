{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Condemning the discrimination, hate crimes, racism, bigotry, bullying, and brutal violence perpetrated against Sikh-Americans, and all acts of vandalism against Sikh Gurdwaras in the United States, and remembering the tragedy that occurred at the Sikh Gurdwara of Wisconsin one year ago.    Whereas Sikh-Americans have frequently been stereotyped solely because of their appearance, practices and traditions;   Whereas numerous Sikh temples have been defaced and Sikh-Americans attacked out of ignorance and hatred, including instances in Michigan, New York, California, and Washington;   Whereas some incidents against Sikh-Americans appear to be erroneous attempts to place blame or exact retribution for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;   Whereas the heinous attack and killing of six persons and wounding of others in the Sikh Gurdwara of Wisconsin occurred a year ago on August 5, 2012;   Whereas a Sikh-American cab driver was assaulted on October 17, 2012, near Seattle, Washington;   Whereas a Sikh-American-owned convenience store in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was set ablaze on March 5, 2013;   Whereas 82-year-old Piara Singh was brutally attacked as he was leaving his Gurdwara in Fresno, California, on May 8, 2013;   Whereas Sikh-Americans are often targeted solely because of their unique dress and religious practices;   Whereas surveys have found that up to 3 out of every 4 Sikh boys in the United States are bullied due to their appearance;   Whereas the Sikh faith is the world’s fifth largest religion, with more than 25,000,000 practitioners worldwide, upwards of 500,000 of whom reside in the United States;   Whereas Sikh-Americans have lived in the United States for at least 100 years as pillars of society, making invaluable contributions in business, politics, science, and education;   Whereas Sikh-Americans serve in all roles of American life, including as family members, business owners, elected leaders, and members of the United States military;   Whereas Dalip Singh Saund served as a Sikh-American member of the U.S. House of Representatives in the late 1950s and early 1960s; and   Whereas under successive Administrations, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]has rightfully reached out to the Sikh community to prevent discrimination and protect its civil liberties: Now, therefore, be it    

= =
