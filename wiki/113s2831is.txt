 To direct the President to establish an interagency mechanism to coordinate United States development programs and private sector investment activities, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Economic Growth and Development Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress makes the following findings:
:(1) The promotion of sustainable economic growth is the only long-term solution to lifting people out of poverty and addressing development challenges such as infectious disease, food security, education, and access to clean water.
:(2) Several of the greatest development success stories in the last 50 years demonstrate how private sector investment and economic growth are fundamental to lifting populations out of poverty.
:(3) There has been a dramatic shift in the composition of capital flows to the developing world. Whereas 40 years ago more than 70 percent of capital flowing to developing countries was public sector foreign assistance, today 87 percent of capital flowing to the developing world comes from the private sector.
:(4) Eleven of the 15 largest importers of United States goods and services are countries that graduated from United States foreign assistance, and 12 of the 15 fastest growing markets for United States exports are former United States foreign assistance recipients.
:(5) With 12 departments, 26 agencies, and more than 60 Federal Government offices all involved in the delivery of United States foreign assistance, it is extremely difficult for United States businesses to navigate the bureaucracy in search of opportunities to partner with such United States agencies.
:(6) Although many United States development agencies have taken steps to improve their private sector coordination capabilities in recent years, these agency-specific strategies remain opaque and must be integrated into a coherent interagency coordination structure to engage the private sector.
:(7) President Barack Obama's 2010 Policy Directive on Global Development created an Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) for Global Development. However, the IPC has not yet established a streamlined, interagency mechanism for coordination with the private sector.
:(8) In order to better leverage United States foreign assistance dollars and to promote sustainable economic development in partner countries, the private sector should be consulted during development planning and programming processes.
:(9) Whether it is in the context of country, sector, or global development strategy, decisions on program prioritization and resource allocations would benefit greatly from private sector perspectives and market data.
:(10) By consulting with the private sector from the outset, development programs can be designed to better attract private sector investment and to promote public-private partnerships in key development sectors.
:(11) The [[w:Millennium Challenge Corporation|Millennium Challenge Corporation]]and the Partnership for Growth both analyze constraints to growth as part of their planning processes, but these analyses need to be included in agency country, sector, and global development strategies to more effectively inform and guide the full spectrum of United States development programs.
