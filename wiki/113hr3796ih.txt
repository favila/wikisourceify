===(1) In general– ===

Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the Secretary shall develop bundled payments for qualified entities. A bundled payment shall provide for comprehensive payment for the costs of applicable services furnished to an applicable beneficiary during an episode of care for an applicable condition, including readmissions related to the applicable condition but excluding unrelated readmissions, under either a fee-for-service model with shared savings and losses (under subsection (g)) or under a prospective payment model for advanced qualified entities (under subsection (h)). Bundled payments shall be based on the spending targets computed under paragraph (2).

====(A) In general– ====

The Secretary shall compute under this paragraph, for each qualified entity for each applicable condition for an episode of care beginning in an agreement year (beginning with 2015) that is attributable to a discharging hospital, a spending target equal to the updated amount computed under subparagraph (C) for that entity, episode, and year.

====(B) Initial weighted average calculation for discharging hospitals– ====



=====(i) In general– =====

Using fee-for-service claims data from the base period (as defined in subparagraph (D)), subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall first calculate a base average spending target for each applicable condition for each discharging hospital equal to a weighted average of spending under parts A and B for all applicable services for such applicable condition associated with initial admissions to such hospital computed as the sum of the following (with respect to such hospital):

:(II) 30 percent of the standardized spending per episode in the previous year.
:(III) 10 percent of the standardized spending per episode in the second previous year.

=====(ii) Exclusion of outliers and standardization– =====

In calculating the amount of the base average spending target for an applicable condition under clause (i) for a discharging hospital, the Secretary shall—
:(I) exclude from the calculation payments for episodes of care for the applicable condition that exceed the 95th percentile of all such spending for such episodes of care and applicable condition, as estimated by the Secretary, based on the most recent data available; and
:(II) standardize the spending made in each year in the base period to each provider of service or supplier to remove the spending adjustments in effect in such year relating to provider or supplier location (such as area wage indices) and provider type (such as indirect medical education adjustments and disproportionate share hospital adjustments).

====(C) Trending the spending targets based on national growth rates to agreement year; periodic rebasing for new agreement periods– ====



=====(i) In general– =====

The Secretary shall update the base average spending targets for all discharging hospitals under subparagraph (B) for each applicable condition and agreement year based on trends in the national fee-for-service claims data for applicable services furnished during an episode of care for an applicable condition from the base period to the agreement year involved. Such update shall not vary by discharging hospital.

=====(ii) Periodic rebasing for new agreement periods– =====

At the start of each new agreement period, the Secretary shall update the base period and calculate new spending targets under the previous provisions of this paragraph for a discharging hospital and applicable conditions, including providing for adjustments by provider location and provider type of the type described in subparagraph (B)(ii)(II).

====(D) Base period defined– ====

In this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C)(ii), the term base period means the most recent 3-year period for which complete data are available to carry out this subsection.

==(g) Fee-for-Service bundled payment model with shared savings and shared losses– ==



===(1) Fee-for-service-based payment– ===

If the payment model under this subsection is selected by a qualified entity, the Secretary shall pay providers of services and suppliers of the entity for applicable services for an applicable condition during an episode of care amounts payable under parts A and B for such services in the same manner as such providers and suppliers would otherwise be paid under such parts (referred to in this subsection as “fee-for-service payments” ).

===(2) Shared savings and losses– ===



====(A) Computation of each qualified entity’s actual standardized average spending per episode of care– ====

In applying this subsection, in calculating the actual standardized average fee-for-service spending per episode of care for a discharging hospital for each applicable condition in each agreement year, the Secretary shall exclude outlier episodes of care described in subsection (f)(2)(B)(ii)(I), as estimated by the Secretary, based on data applicable to payments in the agreement year and shall standardize such spending per episode of care in the manner provided in subsection (f)(2)(B)(ii)(II). For the purpose of identifying outlier episodes of care for each applicable condition, the percentile ranking of each episode of care and applicable condition and the 95th percentile shall be based on payments standardized by adjustments for provider location and provider type of the type described in subsection (f)(2)(B)(ii)(II).

====(B) Computation of gross shared savings and shared losses for each applicable condition for each discharging hospital– ====

For purposes of applying subparagraph (C), if actual standardized average fee-for-service payments to a qualified entity for all episodes of care for an applicable condition in an agreement year for a discharging hospital, as calculated under subparagraph (A), are—
:(i) less than the applicable spending target under subsection (f)(2)(C) for such condition, year, and hospital, there shall be a gross shared savings for such applicable condition, year, and hospital equal to 60 percent of the difference between such actual average payments and the spending target for such condition, year, and hospital; or
:(ii) greater than such applicable spending target, there shall be a gross shared loss for such applicable condition, year, and hospital equal to 60 percent of such difference.

====(C) Retrospective reconciliation– ====



=====(i) Totaling gross shared savings and losses for all conditions and all discharging hospitals for a qualified entity– =====

At the end of each agreement year for each qualified entity, for purposes of applying clauses (ii) and (iii), the Secretary shall aggregate the gross shared savings and the gross shared losses under subparagraph (B) of such entity for the year for all applicable conditions and for all discharging hospitals.

=====(ii) Payment to entity of net savings– =====

Subject to clause (iv) and subsection (j)(3) (relating to quality performance thresholds), if such aggregate gross shared savings exceeds such aggregate gross shared losses for a qualified entity for an agreement year, the Secretary shall pay to the qualified entity a lump sum amount equal to such excess for such year.

=====(iii) Collection from entity of net losses– =====

Subject to clause (iv), if such aggregate gross shared losses exceeds such aggregate gross shared savings for a qualified entity for an agreement year, the qualified entity shall pay to the Secretary (and the Secretary shall collect from the entity) a lump sum amount equal to such excess for such year.

=====(iv) Cap on payments– =====

In no case shall the payment under clause (ii) or (iii) with respect to a qualified entity for an agreement year exceed 10 percent of the aggregate spending target for that qualified entity for all applicable conditions and all discharging hospitals for that year.

==(h) Prospective bundled payment model for advanced qualified entities– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Subject to approval by the Secretary, if the payment model under this subsection is selected, a qualified entity may elect to receive a prospective bundled payment for each episode of care for each applicable condition and discharging hospital in the agreement year equal to the spending target for such episode, year, and hospital under subsection (f)(2) and the provisions of subsection (g) do not apply. Such spending target shall be adjusted, in the same manner described in subsection (g)(2)(B), in order to take into account outlier episodes of care and standardized adjustments for provider location and provider type of the type described in subsection (f)(2)(B)(ii)(II).

===(2) Rule of construction– ===
