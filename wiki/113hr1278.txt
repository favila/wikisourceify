{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Trademark Act of 1946 regarding the disparagement of Native American persons or peoples through marks that use the term“redskin”, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|HAA582E1DD65148A98360DA534306C2C1}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Non-Disparagement of Native American Persons or Peoples in Trademark Registration Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|HF5269D44D448457988B1E07ABF84E719}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The use of the terms“redskin”and“redskins”in trademarks is widely understood to refer to or imply a negative reference to Native American persons or peoples, or both.
:(2) The term“redskin”has been demonstrated by overwhelming linguistic and historical evidence to constitute a disparaging epithet insulting to Native American persons or peoples, or both.
:(3) Major Native American organizations, including the National Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Education Association, the Native American Journalists Association, the Native American Rights Fund, the Morning Star Institute, the International Indian Treaty Council, and the National Indian Youth Council, have opposed the continued use of the term“redskin”in trademarks or as the name of sports teams.
:(4) Recent psychological evidence has demonstrated the general negative effects associated with references in sports to Native American people.
:(5) Trademarks containing the term“redskin”, or any derivation of the term, should not continue to enjoy the benefits of Federal registration.
