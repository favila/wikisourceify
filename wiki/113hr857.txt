			 purpose=



=={{anchor|H3ECF9061B0344674887686AE26D0AD7F}}(a) Findings– ==

Congress
			 finds the following:
:(1) On August 2, 2011,
			 the [[w:President of the United States|President]] signed into law S. 365, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which
			 reduced defense discretionary spending by $478 billion over ten years.
:(2) The Budget Control
			 Act of 2011 also established a sequestration in the event that a Joint Select
			 Committee on Deficit Reduction could not agree on an additional $1.2 trillion
			 in savings by November 2011.
:(3) The Joint Select
			 Committee on Deficit Reduction was unable to reach an agreement, which
			 triggered sequestration, resulting in an additional $495 billion reduction in
			 defense spending over the same ten-year period.
:(4) If these
			 reductions in defense spending remain intact, the total portion of defense
			 spending as a percentage of the total U.S. budget will be at its lowest point
			 since before World War II.
:(5) Sequestration
			 alone would reduce our military force to its smallest level since 1940,
			 resulting in the separation of more than 100,000 soldiers, sailors, Marines,
			 and airmen.
:(6) Since 2009, the
			 number of troops has more than doubled in Afghanistan from 30,000 to 66,000
			 today. During the same period, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has actively reduced the budget for the
			 [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

=={{anchor|H36847BAC2D784854827ACDA841A2CC8B}}(b) Purpose– ==

It
			 is the purpose of this Act to:
:(1) Avoid deeper,
			 irresponsible defense cuts in the face of an increasingly dangerous world that
			 unnecessarily threaten our national security and will cost American lives in
			 armed conflict abroad.
:(2) Invest in advanced
			 military technology in order to equip the U.S. military with the best resources
			 available to defend our country.
:(3) Not allow the
			 strategy of the U.S. military to be driven by budget constraints, which is
			 unacceptable. The strategy should drive the budget. Avoiding cuts while our
			 troops are at war allows necessary time to adjust strategy for the restructured
			 force post-Afghanistan. Before the House Armed Services Committee, Chairman of
			 the Joint Chiefs General Dempsey testified “If you want [your military]
			 to be doing what it’s doing today, then we can’t give you another
			 dollar.”.
:(4) Ensure that the
			 U.S. military forces are adequately prepared. Commandant of the Marine Corps,
			 General Amos, in his statement before the House Armed Services Committee
			 remarked, “By the end of calendar year 2013, less than half of our ground
			 units will be trained to the minimum readiness level required for
			 deployment.”. Sequestration, if left unchecked, will cost American
			 lives. The hollow force experienced during the Korean War would be today’s
			 reality.
:(5) Halt irresponsible
			 budget cuts because no amount of savings can justify the loss of one American
			 service member.

				equally among the sequestration for the defense function for fiscal years 2015
				through
				2021..
