{{section|HDEB92AD85F70421A94365DFD53DA6E67|1. Short title}}
This Act may be cited as the
			 
          Protect Troops at War Act of
			 2013

        
.

{{section|HA901C2C01DF145D2A2C92053CC184658|2. Findings and purpose}}
(a)
Findings
Congress
			 finds the following:
(1)
On August 2, 2011,
			 the [[President of the United States|President]] signed into law S. 365, the Budget Control Act of 2011
, which
			 reduced defense discretionary spending by $478 billion over ten years.

(2)
The Budget Control
			 Act of 2011
 also established a sequestration in the event that a Joint Select
			 Committee on Deficit Reduction
 could not agree on an additional $1.2 trillion
			 in savings by November 2011.

(3)
The Joint Select
			 Committee on Deficit Reduction
 was unable to reach an agreement, which
			 triggered sequestration, resulting in an additional $495 billion reduction in
			 defense spending over the same ten-year period.

(4)
If these
			 reductions in defense spending remain intact, the total portion of defense
			 spending as a percentage of the total U.S. budget will be at its lowest point
			 since before World War II.

(5)
Sequestration
			 alone would reduce our military force to its smallest level since 1940,
			 resulting in the separation of more than 100,000 soldiers, sailors, Marines,
			 and airmen.

(6)
Since 2009, the
			 number of troops has more than doubled in Afghanistan from 30,000 to 66,000
			 today. During the same period, [[United States Congress|Congress]] has actively reduced the budget for the
			 [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].


(b)
Purpose
It
			 is the purpose of this Act to:
(1)
Avoid deeper,
			 irresponsible defense cuts in the face of an increasingly dangerous world that
			 unnecessarily threaten our national security and will cost American lives in
			 armed conflict abroad.

(2)
Invest in advanced
			 military technology in order to equip the U.S. military with the best resources
			 available to defend our country.

(3)
Not allow the
			 strategy of the U.S. military to be driven by budget constraints, which is
			 unacceptable. The strategy should drive the budget. Avoiding cuts while our
			 troops are at war allows necessary time to adjust strategy for the restructured
			 force post-Afghanistan. Before the House Armed Services Committee
, Chairman of
			 the Joint Chiefs General Dempsey testified If you want [your military]
			 to be doing what it’s doing today, then we can’t give you another
			 dollar.
.

(4)
Ensure that the
			 U.S. military forces are adequately prepared. Commandant of the Marine Corps,
			 General Amos, in his statement before the House Armed Services Committee

			 remarked, By the end of calendar year 2013, less than half of our ground
			 units will be trained to the minimum readiness level required for
			 deployment.
. Sequestration, if left unchecked, will cost American
			 lives. The hollow force experienced during the Korean War would be today’s
			 reality.

(5)
Halt irresponsible
			 budget cuts because no amount of savings can justify the loss of one American
			 service member.



{{section|H6A0A41F24C01407CBCB82317483061D0|3. Postponement of FY 2013 and 2014 defense sequestration}}

        Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and
			 Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985
 is amended by adding at the end the
			 following new paragraph:
(12)
Notwithstanding paragraphs (5)
 and (8)
,
				there shall be no reductions under this section to discretionary appropriations
				or direct spending for fiscal year 2013 or 2014 for the defense function. The
				reduction that would otherwise have occurred shall be added to and distributed
				equally among the sequestration for the defense function for fiscal years 2015
				through
				2021.
