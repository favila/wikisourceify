=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) 
::(A) the United States faces an obesity epidemic in which 30.5 percent of children ages 10 through 17 are overweight or obese;
::(B) the obesity epidemic contributes to increasing rates of chronic illness, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer; and
::(C) the obesity epidemic cost the United States $147,000,000 in medical expenses in 2008, and this cost is expected to rise in the future;
:(2) the Reinvestment Fund estimates that almost 25,000,000 people in the United States live in low-income communities with limited access to supermarkets and grocery stores;
:(3) more than 130 studies show that—
::(A) access to healthy food is particularly a problem in hundreds of low-income, rural, and urban communities, as well as communities of color in the United States; and
::(B) the opportunity to access healthy food is linked to lower levels of obesity, diabetes, and other food-related chronic illnesses, leading to better health outcomes;
:(4) 
::(A) children from low-income families are twice as likely to be overweight as children from higher income families; and
::(B) African-American and Hispanic children are more likely than Caucasian children to be obese;
:(5) studies show that when healthy foods are available, people will increase consumption of fruits and vegetables;
:(6) leading public health experts, including the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] , the American Heart Association, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Public Health Association, agree that providing improved access to supermarkets and grocery stores is needed to improve public health and prevent obesity;
:(7) developing high-quality fresh food retail outlets creates jobs, expands markets for agricultural producers in the United States, and supports economic vitality in underserved communities;
:(8) 
::(A) supermarkets and grocery stores often face barriers to opening stores in food deserts;
::(B) the supermarket industry operates on an historically thin profit margin;
::(C) according to the 2011 National Grocers Association Independent Grocers Survey, the average net profit margin before taxes for independent grocers in 2010 was 1.08 percent;
::(D) urban operators face barriers, including—
:::(i) increased real estate costs or limited availability of suitable commercial real estate in the community;
:::(ii) increased employee training needs and costs;
:::(iii) elevated security expenses; and
:::(iv) often zoning restrictions;
::(E) supermarkets and grocery stores in rural food deserts also face barriers, including increased food delivery costs due to distance from distributers, dispersed customer base, and low volume; and
::(F) access to affordable capital is a significant problem for both rural and urban projects;
:(9) by providing seed capital and technical assistance, the Federal Government, through time-limited investments, can—
::(A) attract private sector investment to create and retain much-needed jobs; and
::(B) provide long-term, sustainable solutions to the decades-old problem of limited access to healthy food in underserved, low-income urban and rural communities; and
:(10) legislation establishing a national fund modeled on the successful Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative will help address the obesity epidemic while also creating much-needed jobs and economic revitalization, and solving the healthy food access problem in hundreds of communities across the United States.
