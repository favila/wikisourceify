{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a bipartisan 21st Century Great Outdoors Commission to assess the use, value, job creation, and economic opportunities associated with the outdoor resources of the public lands and other land and water areas of the United States, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H4650C269391C438F8249CD555DDDEAC9}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“21st Century Great Outdoors Commission Act”.

={{anchor|HF9E88F1CAACA4553993ECE78D6C3C92B}}Sec. 2. Establishment of commission=

There is established in the legislative branch a bipartisan [[w:|21st Century Great Outdoors Commission]] to assess the use, value, job creation, and economic opportunities associated with the outdoor resources of the public lands and other land and water areas of the United States, and for other purposes. The outdoor resources of the public lands and other land and water areas of the United States confer enormous benefits on the people of the United States including providing clean water as well as economic benefits.

={{anchor|H6204A47EC63B4D4CBA2F107C5441A63D}}Sec. 3. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Current research indicates that changing demographics, impacts of climate change, lack of public access, and funding shortfalls create challenges for land and recreation managers. The research also affirms that outdoor resources present opportunities for job creation and economic development.
:(2) Outdoor recreation is responsible for more than $646,000,000,000 in direct consumer spending, generates more than $80,000,000,000 in Federal, State, and local taxes and supports more than 6,100,000 American jobs.
:(3) Outdoor recreation opportunities are critical to the Nation’s 46,800,000 hunters and anglers who generate at least 33,700,000,000 in economic activity nationwide.
:(4) Outdoor recreation promotes better mental and physical health for children. Research shows that spending time outside enhances fitness and improves academic achievement.
:(5) Therapeutic and adaptive recreation programs provide invaluable benefits to disabled and injured veterans. These programs not only aid in physical recovery but also help to address mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and other afflictions suffered by wounded warriors.
:(6) It has been increasingly clear that land and water available for outdoor recreation also has other benefits to society including the protection of water resources, the conservation of fish and wildlife habitat, protection of communities from natural hazards such as flooding and storms, reduction in air pollution and sustaining rural land uses such ranching, farming, and forest management.
:(7) The 2010 Census reports that four out of five Americans now live in urban or metropolitan areas, making the need for safe and accessible“close-to-home”outdoor recreation opportunities more important than ever.
:(8) The American people have benefitted from two federally initiated national reviews of outdoor recreation resources in the latter half of the twentieth century. The Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission, established by legislation and signed by President Eisenhower in 1958, issued its report in 1962, which led to the passage of several landmark conservation and outdoor recreation laws. The President’s Commission on Outdoor Recreation, established by Executive order by President Reagan and Chaired by then Governor Lamar Alexander, issued its report in 1987, the findings of which solidified the importance of our Nation’s outdoor recreation laws and further recognized the value of partnerships and cooperation in ensuring outdoor recreation opportunities for all Americans. The [[w:|21st Century Great Outdoors Commission]] established in this Act will build upon this foundation of existing conservation and recreation programs that were created from the previous commissions and will address recreation and conservation needs in 21st century America. Further, it will help guide policies to help meet the demands for outdoor recreation and conservation throughout the Nation.
:(9) The bipartisan Outdoor Resources Review Group, through Resources for the Future, reported on the State of the Great Outdoors in 2009 identifying issues with the supply and financing of outdoor recreation opportunities.
:(10) The Obama Administration launched the America’s Great Outdoors Initiative to develop a 21st century conservation and recreation agenda. The America’s Great Outdoors Initiative led to the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation, which strives to support and enhance outdoor recreation access and opportunities on Federal public lands, waters, and shores.
:(11) The bipartisan Western Governors’ Association released a report in 2012 identifying challenges and recommending strategies for providing outdoor recreation experiences in the Western United States.
:(12) It has been over 25 years since the last presidentially directed review of America’s conservation and outdoor recreation needs. The people of the United States would benefit from a new federally initiated bipartisan review of American outdoor resources and from policy recommendations including how to maximize the economic opportunities associated with changing use patterns, how differing regions can access American outdoor resources, and how Federal, State, local, and private interests can address existing challenges.
