{{Center|A BILL}}

 To end the unconstitutional delegation of legislative power which was exclusively vested in the Senate and House of Representatives by article I, section 1 of the United States Constitution, and to direct the Comptroller General of the United States to issue a report to Congress detailing the extent of the problem of unconstitutional delegation to the end that such delegations can be phased out, thereby restoring the constitutional principle of separation of powers set forth in the first sections of the United States Constitution.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Write the Laws Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=


:(a) Article I, section 1 of the United States Constitution vests the legislative powers enumerated therein in the [[w:United States Congress|United States Congress]], consisting of a [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]and a [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], subject only to the veto power of the President as provided in article I, section 7, clause 2.
:(b) Article II, section 1 of the United States Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in a President of the United States, except as enumerated in article II, section 2.
:(c) Article III, section 1 of the United States Constitution vests the judicial power of the United States in“one supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,”subject only to the jurisdictional limitations set forth in article III, section 2.
:(d)  “<nowiki>In the main, [the United States Constitution] has blocked out with singular precision, and in bold lines, in its three primary Articles, the allotment of power to the executive, the legislative, and judicial departments of the government [and] the powers confided by the Constitution to one of these departments cannot be exercised by another.</nowiki>”Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 191 (1881).
:(e)  “It is … essential to the successful working of this system, that the persons entrusted with power in any of these branches shall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided to others, but that each shall by the law of its creation be limited to the exercise of the powers of its own department and no other.”Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 191 (1881).
:(f)  “<nowiki>The increase in the number of States, in their population and wealth, and in the amount of power … [has] present[ed] powerful and growing temptations to those to whom that exercise is intrusted, to overstep the just boundaries of their own department, and enter upon the domain of one of the others, or to assume powers not intrusted to either of them.</nowiki>”Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 191–192 (1881).
:(g) Succumbing to these“powerful and growing”temptations, and beginning in the late nineteenth century with the Interstate Commerce Commission and continuing to the present time, Congress has unconstitutionally created numerous administrative agencies with blended powers, namely, (i) the exercise of legislative power vested by the Constitution in Congress, (ii) the exercise of executive power vested by the Constitution in the President and (iii) the exercise of judicial power vested by the Constitution in the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]and lower Federal courts.
:(h) By delegating legislative, executive and judicial power to the various administrative agencies, Congress has departed from the separation of powers structure of the United States Constitution, and ignored the warning of the framers of that instrument that“<nowiki>[T]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.</nowiki>”James Madison, The Federalist No. 47.
:(i) Further, by delegating legislative, executive, and judicial powers to various administrative agencies, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has unconstitutionally established a Star Chamber-like system of rules promulgated, executed and adjudicated by administrative agencies that are functionally a part of the executive branch of government in violation of the due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment that secures a system of rules promulgated by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]], executed by the President, and adjudicated by the courts independent from the legislative and executive branches of government.
:(j) By the very nature of legislative power, and by the express terms of article I, section 1 of the United States Constitution, Congress may not delegate any legislative power to any other branch of government or other entity, including any administrative agency. As Chief Justice John Marshall stated:“It will not be contended that congress can delegate to the courts, or to any other tribunals, powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.”Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 23 U.S. 1, 41 (1825).
:(k) As Chief Justice Melville Fuller explained, a“criminal offense”created or clarified by an Executive Branch agency is not valid unless the offense“is fully and completely defined by the act”of Congress. In re Kollock, 165 U.S. 526 (1897).
:(l) By vesting legislative power in the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]], the Constitution requires the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]and the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]to enact statutes containing general rules to be executed by the President, as provided in article II, section 1 of the Constitution of the United States, and to be adjudicated in a case or controversy by such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time establish, or in the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], as provided in article III, sections 1 and 2.
:(m) By abdicating its constitutional legislative responsibility to write the laws whereby the people are governed, and having unconstitutionally delegated that power to unelected bureaucrats, Congress has undermined the constitutional protections of (i) the checks and balances of a bicameral legislative body and (ii) of a presidential veto.
:(n) As a direct consequence of Congress having abdicated its responsibility to properly exercise the legislative power vested by the Constitution, Congress has: (i) imposed onerous and unreasonable burdens upon the American people; and (ii) violated the constitutional principle of the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial processes and functions.
:(o) As Chief Justice Roberts observed,“the danger posed by the growing power of the administrative state cannot be dismissed,”as there are now“hundreds of federal agencies poking into every nook and cranny of daily life.”City of Arlington v. FCC. 569 U.S._(2013) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).
