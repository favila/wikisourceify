==Title I— FLAME Act amendments==



==Sec. 101. Findings==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) over the past 2 decades, wildfires have increased dramatically in size and costs;
:(2) existing budget mechanisms for estimating the costs of wildfire suppression are not keeping pace with the actual costs for wildfire suppression due in part to improper budget estimation methodology;
:(3) the FLAME Funds have not been adequate in supplementing wildland fire management funds in cases in which wildland fire management accounts are exhausted; and
:(4) the practice of transferring funds from other agency funds (including the hazardous fuels treatment accounts) by the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]]or the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]to pay for wildfire suppression activities, commonly known as“fire-borrowing”, does not support the missions of the [[w:United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]and the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]with respect to protecting human life and property from the threat of wildfires.
