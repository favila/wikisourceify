==Title II— Modifying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and Funding Conservation and Energy Research and Development==



==Sec. 201. Findings==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] in 1975, to protect the Nation from any future oil supply disruptions. When the program was established, United States refiners were capable of handling light crude and medium crude and the makeup of the SPR matched this capacity. This is not the case today.
:(2) A [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] analysis found that nearly half of the refineries considered vulnerable to supply disruptions are not compatible with the types of oil currently stored in the SPR and would be unable to maintain normal refining capacity if forced to rely on SPR oil as currently constituted, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the SPR in the event of a supply disruption. [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] concluded that the SPR should be comprised of at least 10 percent heavy crude.
:(3) This Act implements the [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] recommendation and dedicates funds received from the transactions to existing energy conservation, research, and assistance programs.

==Sec. 202. Definitions==

In this title—
:(1) the term“light grade petroleum”means crude oil with an API gravity of 35 degrees or higher;
:(2) the term“heavy grade petroleum”means crude oil with an API gravity of 26 degrees or lower; and
:(3) the term“Secretary”means the Secretary of Energy.

==Sec. 203. Objectives==

The objectives of this title are as follows:
:(1) To modernize the composition of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reflect the current processing capabilities of refineries in the United States.
:(2) To provide increased funding to accelerate conservation, energy research and development, and assistance through existing programs.

==Sec. 204. Modification of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve==

Notwithstanding section 161 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6241 42 U.S.C. 6241] ), the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall publish a plan not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act to—
:(1) exchange as soon as possible light grade petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in an amount equal to 10 percent of the total number of barrels of crude oil in the Reserve as of the date of enactment of this Act, for an equivalent volume of heavy grade petroleum plus any additional cash bonus bids received that reflect the difference in the market value between light grade petroleum and heavy grade petroleum and the timing of deliveries of the heavy grade petroleum;
:(2) from the gross proceeds of the cash bonus bids, deposit the amount necessary to pay for the direct administrative and operational costs of the exchange into the SPR Petroleum Account established under section 167 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6247 42 U.S.C. 6247] ); and
:(3) deposit 90 percent of the remaining net proceeds from the exchange into the Infrastructure Renewal Reserve established in section 107.
