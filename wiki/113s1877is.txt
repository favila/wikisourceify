<blockquote>

=====(j) Registration for modification– =====



======(1) In general– ======

======(2) Limitations– ======

A tribunal may not modify any term of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing State, including the duration of the obligation of support. If 2 or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the law of the State of the tribunal issuing the controlling order, as determined under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738B subsection (g)] , establishes the terms of the child support order which are not modifiable.

In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the State of the tribunal that issued the initial controlling order, as determined under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738B subsection (g)] , governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor’s fulfillment of the duty of support established by that controlling order precludes a tribunal of another State from imposing a further obligation of child support on the obligor.

======(4) Parties residing outside the United States– ======

Notwithstanding [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738B paragraph (1)] , a tribunal in the issuing State retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued in that State if—
:(A) 1 party resides in another State; and
:(B) the other party resides outside of the United States..
