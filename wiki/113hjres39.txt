On any vote for which the concurrence of two-thirds is required under this article, the yeas and nays of the Members of either House shall be entered on the Journal of that House.

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] may waive the requirements of this article when a declaration of war is in effect.

Any increase in the internal revenue enacted under such a waiver shall be effective for not longer than two years..
