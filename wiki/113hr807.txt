{{section|HB4FB99AB6D2E4E5D93A6AB025F09114E|2. Findings}}

        [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds that:
(1)
The Act of
			 Congress establishing the Treasury Department of 1789 states that the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary
			 of the Treasury]] shall prepare plans for improving and managing the revenue of
			 the United States Government and for the support of the public credit.

(2)

          Section 321 of
			 title 31, United States Code
, codifies the duty to prepare plans for
			 improving and managing receipts of the United States Government and managing
			 the public debt
.

(3)
In carrying out
			 the statutory responsibilities to support of the public credit

			 and managing the public debt
 the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] shall take all
			 necessary actions to ensure all obligations of the United States Government
			 with regard to debt held by the public are fully discharged when due.

(4)
Such actions may
			 include the forgoing of obligations not related to debt held by the public for
			 a period of time deemed necessary by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] as authorized under section
			 324 of title 31, United States Code
, which states that—
(a)
The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] may—
(1)
dispose of
				obligations—
(A)
acquired by the
				Secretary for the United States Government; or

(B)
delivered by an
				executive agency; and


(2)
make arrangements
				to extend the maturity of those obligations.


(b)
The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] may
				dispose or extend the maturity of obligations under subsection (a)
 of this
				section in the way, in amounts, at prices (for cash, obligations, property, or
				a combination of cash, obligations, or property), and on conditions the
				[[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] considers advisable and in the public
				interest.

{{section|H9FD32C1310D1498D8E9719A0A9B970A0|3. Duty to protect the full faith and credit of the United States Government}}
(a)
In
			 general
In the event that the
			 debt of the United States Government, as defined in section 3101 of title 31,
			 United States Code
, reaches the statutory limit, the authority of the
			 [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] provided in section 3123 of title 31, United States
			 Code
, to pay with legal tender the principal and interest on debt held by the
			 public shall take priority over all other obligations incurred by the
			 Government of the United States.

(b)
Special rule for
			 insufficiency of funds

          Section 324 of title 31, United States
			 Code
, is amended by redesignating subsection (c)
 as subsection (e)
, and by
			 inserting after subsection (b)
 the following:
(c)
If the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] expects that there will be
				insufficient funds available to dispose of all obligations consisting of
				interest and principal of the debt held by the public on the next calendar day
				on which such obligations are due, then the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] shall extend the
				maturities of any other obligations under section (a)
 and refuse to issue
				warrants under section 321(a)(3)
 to the extent necessary to provide such funds
				as the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] deems prudent to dispose of obligations consisting of interest
				and principal of the debt held by the public for no less than the next 30
				calendar days.

(d)
To the extent receipts exceed those
				required to meet the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary’s]] obligation under subsection (c)
, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]]
				shall prioritize the disposal of obligations under subsection (a)
 and issuance
				of warrants under section 321(a)(3)
 in that order the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] considers
				advisable and in the public interest.
