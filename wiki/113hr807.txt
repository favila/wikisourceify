:: The [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury ]]may—::: dispose of obligations—:::: acquired by the Secretary for the United States Government; or:::: delivered by an executive agency; and::: make arrangements to extend the maturity of those obligations.:: The [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary ]]may dispose or extend the maturity of obligations under subsection (a) of this section in the way, in amounts, at prices (for cash, obligations, property, or a combination of cash, obligations, or property), and on conditions the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary ]]considers advisable and in the public interest..

3. Duty to protect the full faith and credit of the United States Government


=(a) In general=

In the event that the debt of the United States Government, as defined in section 3101 of title 31, United States Code , reaches the statutory limit, the authority of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury ]]provided in section 3123 of title 31, United States Code , to pay with legal tender the principal and interest on debt held by the public shall take priority over all other obligations incurred by the Government of the United States.
=(b) Special rule for insufficiency of funds=

Section 324 of title 31, United States Code , is amended by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (e) , and by inserting after subsection (b) the following:
: If the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary ]]expects that there will be insufficient funds available to dispose of all obligations consisting of interest and principal of the debt held by the public on the next calendar day on which such obligations are due, then the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary ]]shall extend the maturities of any other obligations under section (a) and refuse to issue warrants under section 321(a)(3) to the extent necessary to provide such funds as the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary ]]deems prudent to dispose of obligations consisting of interest and principal of the debt held by the public for no less than the next 30 calendar days.: To the extent receipts exceed those required to meet the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary’s ]]obligation under subsection (c) , the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary ]]shall prioritize the disposal of obligations under subsection (a) and issuance of warrants under section 321(a)(3) in that order the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary ]]considers advisable and in the public interest..
