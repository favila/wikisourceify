      Findings; sense
			 of Congress
			
        (a)
        Findings
        
          
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             makes the following
			 findings:
				
          (1)
          Fort Hood, Texas,
			 has played a highly prominent role in the Global War on Terror, deploying more
			 members of the Armed Forces into overseas theaters of combat since September
			 11, 2001, than any other United States military installation.
				
        
          (2)
          The members of the
			 Armed Forces and community of Fort Hood have answered the call to service with
			 honor and distinction, and the post has paid a steep price, suffering more
			 combat casualties in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom
			 than any other United States military installation.
				
        
          (3)
          In February 2011,
			 the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate
			 issued a report entitled A Ticking Time Bomb: Counterterrorism Lessons
			 from the U.S. Government's Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack,
			 which stated the following: On November 5, 2009, 13 Americans—12
			 servicemembers and one civilian employee of DoD—were killed and 32 were wounded
			 in an attack at the military base at Fort Hood, Texas. This tragedy was the
			 deadliest terrorist attack within the United States since September 11,
			 2001..
				
      
      
        (b)
        Sense of
			 Congress
        It is the sense of 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             that—
				
          (1)
          any member of the
			 Armed Forces or civilian employee of the 
                [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]
             who was killed
			 or wounded in the attack that occurred at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5,
			 2009, and the family members of those victims, should receive the same
			 treatment and benefits as the victims and families of victims of the September
			 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States; and
				
        
          (2)
          these Americans
			 have made tremendous sacrifices, and the United States should provide them with
			 the maximum level of benefits available, identical to the level of benefits
			 available to those who have been killed or wounded in an overseas combat zone
			 such as Iraq or Afghanistan.
