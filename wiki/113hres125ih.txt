{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Encouraging the Navy to commission the USS Somerset (LPD–25) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.    Whereas the USS Somerset (LPD–25) is the ninth and newest amphibious transport dock ship in the San Antonio class;   Whereas the USS Somerset honors the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 whose actions prevented terrorist hijackers from reaching their intended target, forcing the aircraft to crash in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 2001;   Whereas, in the words of former Secretary of the Navy Gordon England,“The courage and heroism of the people aboard the flight will never be forgotten and USS Somerset will leave a legacy that will never be forgotten by those wishing to do harm to this country.”;   Whereas the USS Somerset joins the USS New York (LPD–21) and the USS Arlington (LPD–24) in remembering the heroes of September 11, 2001;   Whereas the USS Somerset was christened in July 2012 and will be commissioned when it is put in active service;   Whereas the Navy has cleared Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a potential site for the commissioning ceremony of the USS Somerset; and   Whereas Philadelphia is one of the closest ports to Somerset County, and it would be fitting that the commissioning ceremony be held there: Now, therefore, be it

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]encourages the Navy to commission the USS Somerset (LPD–25) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
