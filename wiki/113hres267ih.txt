{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Congratulating the University of Washington Huskies Men’s Crew Team for winning the 2013 Intercollegiate Rowing Association National Championship.    Whereas crew is the oldest intercollegiate sport in the United States, dating back to 1852;   Whereas the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship, which began in 1895, is the oldest college rowing championship in the United States and is one of the most prestigious championships in collegiate rowing;   Whereas the University of Washington first attended the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship in 1913;   Whereas the Washington Huskies Men’s Crew Team was the number one ranked team in the United States all season and entered the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships as the top seeded team;   Whereas the University of Washington Huskies Men’s Crew Team are the National Champions after a dominating performance at the 111th Annual IRA National Championships;   Whereas the Huskies capped a perfect weekend on Lake Natoma by sweeping all 5 grand finals to win their third-consecutive and 16th overall National Championship for the University of Washington Men’s Crew;   Whereas the Huskies broke their own record in Intercollegiate Rowing Association history, with no team ever winning more than 4 consecutive Ten Eyck awards until the Huskies made it 5 in 2011, 6 in 2012, and now 7 in 2013;   Whereas the entire University of Washington Men’s Crew Team should be commended for demonstrating determination, work ethic, and heart;   Whereas University of Washington Men’s Crew coach, Michael Callahan, has led the team to 4 national titles, 2 second-place titles, never lost a Ten Eyck award, and has accomplished a feat no other program in collegiate rowing has ever accomplished, sweeping every Intercollegiate Rowing Association category at the finals not once but twice;   Whereas the Huskies Men’s Crew Team is also the 2013 Pac-12 Champions;   Whereas the Husky men had a total of 11 student-athletes selected to the Pac-12's All-Academic list with a minimum of a 3.0 minimum grade point average; and   Whereas Husky seniors were chosen for the Pac-12 All Conference Rowing Team while sophomore Alex Perkins was honored as the Pac-12 Newcomer of the Year and head coach Michael Callahan received the Coach of the Year award for the fourth straight year: Now, therefore, be it
