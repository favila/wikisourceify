:(1) The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, enacted in 2004 and later amended by the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act Improvements Act of 2010, gives law enforcement officers, including [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP) employees, the right to carry a concealed firearm in all fifty States for self-protection.
:(2) The intent of the law is to allow law enforcement officers to protect themselves while off duty.
:(3) Correctional workers in the [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|BOP]] have been the targets of assaults and murders while off duty.
:(4) While this law allows officers to protect themselves off duty, the [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|BOP]] does not allow staff to carry their personal weapon on the grounds of most facilities when commuting to and from work.
:(5) The [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|BOP]] allows carry to and from work and storage at approximately 15 facilities in the [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|BOP]] , but they do not reasonably explain why they allow some [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|BOP]] staff to carry on [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|BOP]] property while others are not allowed.
