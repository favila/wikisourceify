.

{{section|H962E35B0F78A42189847D8BDECDFCDA1|2. Congressional finding}}

        [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds that
			 the Authorization for Use of Military Force
 (Public Law 107–40
; 50 U.S.C. 1541
			 note
)
, signed into law on September 18, 2001, has been used to justify a broad
			 and open-ended authorization for the use of military force and such an
			 interpretation is inconsistent with the authority of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to declare war
			 and make all laws for executing powers vested by the Constitution in the
			 Government of the United States.

{{section|H1DCF0393652144BAA99E677694479D4C|3. Repeal of Public Law 107–40}}
Effective 180 days
			 after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Authorization for Use of
			 Military Force
 (Public Law 107–40
; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note
)
 is hereby
			 repealed.
