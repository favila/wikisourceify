{{Center|A BILL}}

To repeal Public Law 107–40.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Repeal of the Authorization for Use of Military Force”.

=Sec. 2. Congressional finding=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that the Authorization for Use of Military Force([[Public Law 107-40|Public Law 107–40]] ;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1541 50 U.S.C. 1541 note] ), signed into law on September 18, 2001, has been used to justify a broad and open-ended authorization for the use of military force and such an interpretation is inconsistent with the authority of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to declare war and make all laws for executing powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States.

=Sec. 3. Repeal of Public Law 107–40=

Effective 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Authorization for Use of Military Force([[Public Law 107-40|Public Law 107–40]] ;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1541 50 U.S.C. 1541 note] )is hereby repealed.
