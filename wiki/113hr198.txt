{{Center|A BILL}}

To repeal Public Law 107–40.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Repeal of the Authorization for Use of Military Force”.

2. Congressional finding


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds that the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( Public Law 107–40 ; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note ) , signed into law on September 18, 2001, has been used to justify a broad and open-ended authorization for the use of military force and such an interpretation is inconsistent with the authority of [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]to declare war and make all laws for executing powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States.

3. Repeal of Public Law 107–40


Effective 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( Public Law 107–40 ; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note ) is hereby repealed.
