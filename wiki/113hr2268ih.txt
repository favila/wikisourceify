=Sec. 2. K–12 service-learning program=



==(a) In general– ==

   Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6601 20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 

===E Enhancing the effectiveness of K–12 education through service learning– ===



===Sec. 2501. Findings===

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Students learn best when they are actively engaged in meaningful and challenging learning experiences that encourage higher order skills development, critical thinking, and problem solving.
:(2) Service learning is a pedagogy that encompasses key elements of effective teaching and learning, including active learning, authentic experiences, opportunities for peer collaboration, problem solving, student leadership and empowerment, and cognitively challenging academic activities.
:(3) Students invest themselves in learning when their educational experiences have personal meaning to them and are connected to authentic, real issues in their everyday lives.
:(4) In service learning, students apply their knowledge and skills to solve actual community problems and experience the real-world value of what they are learning in school. Service learning can therefore have a powerful effect on students, increasing their academic engagement, their civic engagement and their social and emotional development.
:(5) Service learning can have a powerful effect on students, helping them to increase their academic engagement and performance, their civic engagement and desire to help others, and their social-emotional learning in areas related to 21st century skill acquisition, such as task persistence, intellectual curiosity, and ability to work in teams.
:(6) In service learning, students connect to the community and to their classmates in ways that are far more powerful than simple cooperative learning.
:(7) Service learning has been found to promote behavioral and dispositional factors that mediate students’ educational success such as greater motivation for school, engagement in learning tasks, building of self-efficacy and self-esteem, and propensity to engage in pro-social behaviors.
:(8) Research has demonstrated that test scores of students who participated in service learning are higher in reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, and science than those of non-participants.
:(9) High-quality service learning will improve student achievement and our schools because it employs effective, experiential learning strategies associated with student engagement in academic work and preparation for success in college and the workplace, engages students in solving complex problems, probes for deeper learning, and seeks opportunities for students to transfer knowledge from one context to another.
:(10) Principals report that service learning has a positive impact on teacher satisfaction, school climate, academic achievement, and school engagement.
:(11) Teachers who use service learning in the classroom as a type of positive teaching strategy achieve better results in a variety of academic and behavioral categories than those who don’t, are more effective, challenged, and energized, and are more likely to remain within their chosen profession.
:(12) Only an estimated 24 percent of the approximately 53,300,000 K–12 youth in the United States are given the opportunity to engage in any kind of service-learning experience, a decline from 32 percent in 1999.
:(13) Schools in high-poverty areas are less likely to employ service learning as a teaching strategy, yet research has shown this is a particularly effective pedagogy for use in such schools. Service learning can significantly reduce the achievement gap between affluent and low-income students. Low-income students who participated in service opportunities have better school attendance and grades than low-income students who do not participate.
:(14) There is a need for a rigorous and focused initiative to demonstrate and broadly promote high-quality service learning that enhances teacher effectiveness, improves student learning and educational success, and positively affects school climate.
:(15) State educational agencies are the only entities with comprehensive, statewide responsibility for the quality of learning within a State.

===Sec. 2502. Purpose===

The purpose of this part is to authorize a national service-learning program that will expand opportunities for students in elementary and secondary schools to engage in high-quality service learning that—
:(1) promotes student achievement in academic subjects, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;
:(2) incorporates 21st century skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving and collaboration;
:(3) integrates content knowledge and use of technology;
:(4) enhances school climate and civic engagement; and
:(5) prepares students for college or a career.

===Sec. 2503. National activities===

The [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] shall reserve funds for national activities as follows:
:(1) The [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] shall reserve not more than 10 percent of the appropriation for this program in any fiscal year to establish a National Center for K–12 Service Learning—
::(A) to provide technical assistance to State educational agencies to develop and expand the capacity of local educational agencies to improve teacher quality, school climate, and educational outcomes by providing an infrastructure for sustainable service-learning efforts through vision and leadership, professional development, curriculum and assessment, school-community collaborations, and continuous improvement; and
::(B) to provide oversight, coordinate with key Federal education initiatives, foster sustainability, provide evidence for the strengths and limitations of service-learning practices, and disseminate study findings.
:(2) The [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] shall reserve not more than 10 of the appropriation for this program in any fiscal year percent for research and evaluation activities, including a study, conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences using data culled from the State longitudinal data systems authorized under title II of the Educational Technical Assistance Act of 2002 , on the effects of academic service learning on instructional quality and the academic success of students in low-performing schools. The study shall include the following elements:

::(E) Systematically measuring the influence of service-learning participation on students’ academic achievement within and across States.
::(F) Reporting annually to the public and the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] .
