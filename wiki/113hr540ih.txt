<blockquote>

===(h) Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies– ===



====(1) In general– ====

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection, each Federal agency shall collaborate with the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director of the Office of Management and Budget]] (referred to in this subsection as the Director ) to develop an implementation strategy (including best-practices and measurement and verification techniques) for the maintenance, purchase, and use by the Federal agency of energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies and practices. Each implementation strategy shall be flexible, cost-effective, and based on the specific operating requirements and statutory mission of the agency.

====(2) Administration– ====

In developing an implementation strategy, each Federal agency shall—
:(A) consider information and communications technologies (ICT) and related infrastructure and practices, such as—
::(i) advanced metering infrastructure;
::(ii) ICT services and products;
::(iii) efficient data center strategies and methods of increasing ICT asset and related infrastructure utilization;
::(iv) ICT and related infrastructure power management;
::(v) building information modeling, including building energy management; and
::(vi) secure telework and travel substitution tools; and
:(B) ensure that the agency realizes the savings and rewards brought about through increased efficiency and utilization.

====(3) Performance goals– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this subsection, the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]] , in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] , shall establish performance goals for evaluating the efforts of Federal agencies in improving the maintenance, purchase, and use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technology systems and practices.

=====(B) Energy efficient data centers– =====

The [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]] shall include within the performance goals established under this paragraph—
:(i) specifications and benchmarks that will enable Federal data center operators to make more informed decisions about the energy efficiency and cost savings of data centers, including an overall Federal target for increased energy efficiency, with initial reliance on the Power Usage Effectiveness metric;
:(ii) overall ICT asset utilization and related infrastructure utilization; and
:(iii) recommendations and best practices for how the benchmarks will be attained, with such recommendations to include a requirement for agencies to evaluate the use of energy savings performance contracting as a preferred acquisition method for data center efficiency.

=====(C) Administration– =====

The performance goals established under this paragraph shall—
:(i) measure information technology costs over a specific time period of 3 to 5 years;
:(ii) measure cost savings attained via the use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications solutions during the same time period; and
:(iii) provide, to the maximum extent practicable, a complete picture of all costs and savings, including energy costs and savings.

====(4) Federal data centers task force– ====

The [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]] shall maintain a Government-wide Data Center Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The members of such task force shall be responsible for working together to share progress toward individual agency goals and the overall Federal target for increased energy efficiency, and shall regularly exchange best practices and other strategic information related to energy efficiency with the private sector.

====(5) Reports– ====



=====(A) Agency reports– =====

Each Federal agency subject to the requirements of this subsection shall include in the report of the agency under section 527 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17143 42 U.S.C. 17143] )a description of the efforts and results of the agency under this subsection.

=====(B) OMB Government efficiency reports and scorecards– =====

Effective beginning not later than October 1, 2013, the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]] shall include in the annual report and scorecard of the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]] required under section 528 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17144 42 U.S.C. 17144] )a description of the efforts and results of Federal agencies under this subsection..
