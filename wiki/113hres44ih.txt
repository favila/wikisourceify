{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Federal laboratories have been and continue to be on the cutting edge of scientific and technological advancement and supporting the designation of 2013 as the“Year of the Federal Lab”.    Whereas a Federal laboratory is defined as any laboratory, federally funded research and development center, or center that is owned, leased, or otherwise used by a Federal agency and funded by the Federal Government;   Whereas the national network of Federal laboratories should be commended for the unique role they have had in countless innovations and advances in the areas of environment, health, national security, and the basic sciences;   Whereas technological progress is responsible for up to half the growth of the United States economy and is the principal driving force behind long-term economic growth and increases in our standard of living;   Whereas federally supported research and development has led to new products and processes for the commercial marketplace, including antibiotics, plastics, airplanes, computers, microwaves, and bioengineered drugs;   Whereas Federal laboratories frequently partner with State and local governments and regional organizations to transfer technology to the private sector;   Whereas earning prestigious national and international awards for their research and technology transfer efforts, Federal laboratories lead the way in cutting-edge science and technology;   Whereas the innovations that are produced at the Nation’s Federal laboratories fuel economic growth by creating new industries, companies, and jobs;   Whereas since the United States global leadership and national security is dependent on innovation and new industries, the work of the Nation’s network of Federal laboratories is essential to the Nation’s continued prosperity; and   Whereas 2013 would be an appropriate year to designate as the“Year of the Federal Lab”: Now, therefore, be it
