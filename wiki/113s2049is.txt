Such rules shall establish the disclosures that a written communication to which this subsection applies must contain, including—
:(1) a detailed description of—
::(A) each patent allegedly infringed, including the patent number; and
::(B) each claim of each patent that is allegedly infringed;
:(2) a clear, accurate, and detailed description, such as the manufacturer and model number, of each product, device, business method, service, or technology that allegedly infringes each claim under paragraph (1)(B) or that is covered by that claim;
:(3) a clear, accurate, and detailed description of how a product, device, business method, service, or technology under paragraph (2) allegedly infringes a patent or claim under paragraph (1) ;
:(4) notice to the intended recipient that the intended recipient may have the right to have the manufacturer under paragraph (2) defend against the alleged infringement;
:(5) a name, an address, and any other contact information necessary for an intended recipient to determine the identity of a person with the right to enforce a patent described under paragraph (1) or with a direct financial interest in a patent described under paragraph (1) , including each owner, co-owner, assignee, exclusive licensee, and entity with the authority to enforce the patent, and the ultimate parent entity (as defined in section 801.1(a)(3) of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation) of each owner, co-owner, assignee, exclusive licensee, and entity with the authority to enforce the patent;
:(6) a description of any licensing commitment or obligation, such as reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, that applies to a patent or claim under paragraph (1) ;
:(7) if compensation is proposed, the method used to calculate that proposed amount;
:(8) each current instance of reexamination or other post-grant review of each patent described under paragraph (1) at the [[w:Patent and Trademark Office/Under Secretary for Intellectual Property|Patent and Trademark Office]], any past or ongoing litigation involving the patent, and the status of such review and any determinations as to the invalidity of the patent or any of its claims; and

==(c) Unfair or deceptive assertions– ==

The [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Commission]]shall promulgate rules to prohibit unfair or deceptive assertions in written communication to which subsection (a) applies. Such rules shall specify the actions that constitute an unfair or deceptive assertion, including—

Any person who violates this Act shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided in the  Federal Trade Commission Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/41 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq].).

==(g) Enforcement by State attorneys general– ==



===(1) Civil action– ===

In any case in which the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency of a State, has reason to believe that an interest of the residents of that State has been or is threatened or adversely affected by engagement of any person subject to a rule promulgated under this Act in a practice that violates the rule, the attorney general, official, or agency of the State, as parens patriae, may bring a civil action on behalf of the residents of the State in an appropriate district court of the United States—
:(A) to enjoin further violation of the rule by the defendant;
:(B) to compel compliance with the rule;
:(C) to obtain damages, restitution, or other compensation on behalf of such residents;
:(D) to obtain such further and other relief as the court considers appropriate; or
:(E) to obtain civil penalties in the amount determined under paragraph (2) .

===(2) Civil penalties– ===



====(A) Calculation– ====

For purposes of imposing a civil penalty under paragraph (1)(E) , the amount determined under this paragraph is the amount calculated by multiplying the number of separate violations of a rule by an amount not greater than $16,000.

====(B) Adjustment for inflation– ====

Beginning on the date that the Consumer Price Index is first published by the [[w:Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor Statistics]]that is after 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter, the amount specified in subparagraph (A) shall be increased by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index published on that date from the Consumer Price Index published the previous year.

===(3) Intervention by the Commission– ===



====(A) Notice and intervention– ====

The State shall provide prior written notice of any civil action under paragraph (1) to the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Commission]]and provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint, except in any case in which such prior notice is not feasible, in which case the State shall serve such notice immediately upon commencing such action. The Commission shall have the right—
:(i) to intervene in the civil action;
:(ii) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters arising in the civil action; and
:(iii) to file petitions for appeal of a decision in the civil action.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting or otherwise affecting in any way—
:(1) any other authority of the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Commission]]; or
