)
 is amended to read
			 as follows:
(1)

			 end the following:
(h)
(1)
Each year, by not later than the date that

 is
				to take effect, the [[United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] shall determine the minimum wage to be in effect
				pursuant to this subsection for the subsequent 1-year period. The wage
				determined pursuant to this subsection for a year shall be—
(A)
not less than the amount in effect under
				subsection (a)(1)
 on the date of such determination;

(B)
increased from such amount by the
				annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners

				adjusted), or its successor publication, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor
				Statistics]]; and

(C)
rounded to the nearest multiple of
				$0.05.


(2)
In calculating the annual percentage
				increase in the Consumer Price Index for purposes of paragraph (1)(B)
, the
				[[United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] shall compare such Consumer Price Index for the most recent month,
				quarter, or year available (as selected by the [[United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] prior to the first
				year for which a minimum wage is in effect pursuant to this subsection) with
				the Consumer Price Index for the same month in the preceding year, the same
				quarter in the preceding year, or the preceding year,
				respectively.

			 wage for tipped employees

				purposes of such determination shall be not less than—

				period beginning on the first day of the third month that begins after the date
				of enactment of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of
				2013

				succeeding 1-year period until the hourly wage under this paragraph equals 70

 for such period, an hourly
				wage equal to the amount determined under this paragraph for the preceding
				year, increased by the lesser of—
(i)
$0.95; or

(ii)

				necessary for the wage in effect under this paragraph to equal 70 percent of
				the wage in effect under section 6(a)(1)

				nearest multiple of $0.05; and


(C)
for each
				succeeding 1-year period after the year in which the hourly wage under this
				paragraph first equals 70 percent of the wage in effect under section 6(a)(1)

				for the same period, the amount necessary to ensure that the wage in effect
				under this paragraph remains equal to 70 percent of the wage in effect under
				section 6(a)(1)
, rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05;
				and

				Minimum Wage Act of 2013

				Federal Register and on the website of the Department of Labor a notice
				announcing the adjusted required
				wage.
