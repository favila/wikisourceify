 Commemorating the success of Team USA in the past 22 Olympic Winter Games and supporting Team USA in the 2014 Olympic Winter Games and Paralympic Winter Games.    Whereas for over 100 years, the Olympic Movement has built a more peaceful and better world by educating young people through amateur athletics, bringing together athletes from many countries in friendly competition, and forging new relationships bound by friendship, solidarity, and fair play;   Whereas the 2014 Olympic Winter Games will take place in Sochi, Russia from February 7, 2014, to February 23, 2014, and the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games will take place in Sochi, Russia from March 7, 2014, to March 16, 2014;   Whereas at the 2014 Olympic Winter Games, more than 85 nations will compete in 15 sports disciplines, and Team USA will compete in all 15 sports disciplines;   Whereas at the 2014 Olympic Winter Games, more than 85 nations will compete in 7 sports, and Team USA will compete in all 7 sports;   Whereas 230 Olympians and more than 75 Paralympians will compete on behalf of Team USA in Sochi, Russia;   Whereas Team USA has won 87 gold medals, 95 silver medals, and 72 bronze medals, totaling 254 medals in the past 22 Olympic Winter Games;   Whereas the people of the United States stand united in respect and admiration for the members of the United States Winter Olympic and Winter Paralympic teams and the athletic accomplishments, sportsmanship, and dedication to excellence of the teams;   Whereas the many accomplishments of the United States Winter Olympic and Winter Paralympic teams would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of many individuals, including individuals on the United States Olympic Committee and the many administrators, coaches, and family members who provided critical support to the athletes;   Whereas the United States takes great pride in the qualities of commitment to excellence, grace under pressure, and good will toward other competitors that the athletes of Team USA exhibit; and   Whereas the Olympic Movement celebrates competition, fair play, and the pursuit of dreams: Now, therefore, be it
