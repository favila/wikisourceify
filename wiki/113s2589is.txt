=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Business bankruptcies have increased sharply in recent years and remain at high levels. These bankruptcies include several of the largest business bankruptcy filings in history. As the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job preservation and retirement security are placed at greater risk.
:(2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for employees and retirees and limit their losses in bankruptcy cases have not kept pace with the increasing and broader use of bankruptcy by businesses in all sectors of the economy. However, while protections for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases have eroded, management compensation plans devised for those in charge of troubled businesses have become more prevalent and are escaping adequate scrutiny.
:(3) Changes in the law regarding these matters are urgently needed as bankruptcy is used to address increasingly more complex and diverse conditions affecting troubled businesses and industries.

==Title II— Reducing Employees’ and Retirees’ Losses==



==Sec. 201. Rejection of collective bargaining agreements==

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 Section 1113 of title 11, United States Code], is amended by striking[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 subsections (a) through (f)]and inserting the following:

<blockquote> 
:(a) The debtor in possession, or the trustee if one has been appointed under this chapter, other than a trustee in a case covered by subchapter IV of this chapter and by title I of the Railway Labor Act , may reject a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with this section. In this section, a reference to the trustee includes the debtor in possession. 
:(b) No provision of this title shall be construed to permit the trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter any provision of a collective bargaining agreement before complying with this section. The trustee shall timely pay all monetary obligations arising under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Any such payment required to be made before a plan confirmed under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1129 section 1129]is effective has the status of an allowed administrative expense under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/503 section 503]. 
:(c) 
::(1) If the trustee seeks modification of a collective bargaining agreement, the trustee shall provide notice to the labor organization representing the employees covered by the agreement that modifications are being proposed under this section, and shall promptly provide an initial proposal for modifications to the agreement. Thereafter, the trustee shall confer in good faith with the labor organization, at reasonable times and for a reasonable period in light of the complexity of the case, in attempting to reach mutually acceptable modifications of such agreement.
::(2) The initial proposal and subsequent proposals by the trustee for modification of a collective bargaining agreement shall be based upon a business plan for the reorganization of the debtor, and shall reflect the most complete and reliable information available. The trustee shall provide to the labor organization all information that is relevant for negotiations. The court may enter a protective order to prevent the disclosure of information if disclosure could compromise the debtor’s position with respect to its competitors in the industry, subject to the needs of the labor organization to evaluate the trustee’s proposals and any application for rejection of the agreement or for interim relief pursuant to this section.
::(3) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the practice and process of collective bargaining and in recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the employees covered by the agreement, modifications proposed by the trustee—
:::(A) shall be proposed only as part of a program of workforce and nonworkforce cost savings devised for the reorganization of the debtor, including savings in management personnel costs;
:::(B) shall be limited to modifications designed to achieve a specified aggregate financial contribution for the employees covered by the agreement (taking into consideration any labor cost savings negotiated within the 12-month period before the filing of the petition), and shall be not more than the minimum savings essential to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation of a plan of reorganization is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor (or any successor to the debtor) in the short term; and
:::(C) shall not be disproportionate or overly burden the employees covered by the agreement, either in the amount of the cost savings sought from such employees or the nature of the modifications. 
:(d) 
::(1) If, after a period of negotiations, the trustee and the labor organization have not reached an agreement over mutually satisfactory modifications, and further negotiations are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory modifications, the trustee may file a motion seeking rejection of the collective bargaining agreement after notice and a hearing. Absent agreement of the parties, no such hearing shall be held before the expiration of the 21-day period beginning on the date on which notice of the hearing is provided to the labor organization representing the employees covered by the agreement. Only the debtor and the labor organization may appear and be heard at such hearing. An application for rejection shall seek rejection effective upon the entry of an order granting the relief.
::(2) In consideration of Federal policy encouraging the practice and process of collective bargaining and in recognition of the bargained-for expectations of the employees covered by the agreement, the court may grant a motion seeking rejection of a collective bargaining agreement only if, based on clear and convincing evidence—
:::(A) the court finds that the trustee has complied with the requirements of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 subsection (c)];
:::(B) the court has considered alternative proposals by the labor organization and has concluded that such proposals do not meet the requirements of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 paragraph (3)(B) of subsection (c)];
:::(C) the court finds that further negotiations regarding the trustee’s proposal or an alternative proposal by the labor organization are not likely to produce an agreement;
:::(D) the court finds that implementation of the trustee’s proposal shall not—
::::(i) cause a material diminution in the purchasing power of the employees covered by the agreement;
::::(ii) adversely affect the ability of the debtor to retain an experienced and qualified workforce; or
::::(iii) impair the debtor’s labor relations such that the ability to achieve a feasible reorganization would be compromised; and
:::(E) the court concludes that rejection of the agreement and immediate implementation of the trustee’s proposal is essential to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation of a plan of reorganization is not likely to be followed by liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor (or any successor to the debtor) in the short term.
::(3) If the trustee has implemented a program of incentive pay, bonuses, or other financial returns for insiders, senior executive officers, or the 20 next most highly compensated employees or consultants providing services to the debtor during the bankruptcy, or such a program was implemented within 180 days before the date of the filing of the petition, the court shall presume that the trustee has failed to satisfy the requirements of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 subsection (c)(3)(C)].
::(4) In no case shall the court enter an order rejecting a collective bargaining agreement that would result in modifications to a level lower than the level proposed by the trustee in the proposal found by the court to have complied with the requirements of this section.
::(5) At any time after the date on which an order rejecting a collective bargaining agreement is entered, or in the case of an agreement entered into between the trustee and the labor organization providing mutually satisfactory modifications, at any time after such agreement has been entered into, the labor organization may apply to the court for an order seeking an increase in the level of wages or benefits, or relief from working conditions, based upon changed circumstances. The court shall grant the request only if the increase or other relief is not inconsistent with the standard set forth in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 paragraph (2)(E)]. 
:(e) During a period in which a collective bargaining agreement at issue under this section continues in effect, and if essential to the continuation of the debtor’s business or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate, the court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize the trustee to implement interim changes in the terms, conditions, wages, benefits, or work rules provided by the collective bargaining agreement. Any hearing under this subsection shall be scheduled in accordance with the needs of the trustee. The implementation of such interim changes shall not render the application for rejection moot. 
:(f) 
::(1) Rejection of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes a breach of the agreement, and shall be effective no earlier than the entry of an order granting such relief.
::(2) Notwithstanding[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 paragraph (1)], solely for purposes of determining and allowing a claim arising from the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement, rejection shall be treated as rejection of an executory contract under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/365 section 365(g)]and shall be allowed or disallowed in accordance with[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/502 section 502(g)(1)]. No claim for rejection damages shall be limited by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/502 section 502(b)(7)]. Economic self-help by a labor organization shall be permitted upon a court order granting a motion to reject a collective bargaining agreement under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 subsection (d)]or pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1113 subsection (e)], and no provision of this title or of any other provision of Federal or State law may be construed to the contrary. 
:(g) The trustee shall provide for the reasonable fees and costs incurred by a labor organization under this section, upon request and after notice and a hearing. 
:(h) A collective bargaining agreement that is assumed shall be assumed in accordance with[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/365 section 365]. .
