==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] has been engaged in approving, on a project-by-project basis, gain-sharing arrangements under demonstration authority for nearly a decade. Based on the knowledge gained from such demonstration projects, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department]] is capable of developing and applying standards for permitting such arrangements more generally without the use of such authority.
:(2) The [[w:|Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services]] has issued a special advisory bulletin in July 1999 that indicates that there is no general authority for waiving sanctions for any gain-sharing arrangements between physicians and hospitals.
:(3) Due to lack of capitalization, size limitations, risk characteristics, and other factors, many hospitals and physicians have been unable or unwilling to enter into gain-sharing types of arrangements that meet the requirements of the shared savings program.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this section is to establish general statutory authority within the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] to recognize gain-sharing and other incentive payment programs, other than the shared savings program, that align incentives among hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality care.

==(c) Exception from physician self-Referral prohibition– ==

 Section 1877(e) of the Social Security Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395nn 42 U.S.C. 1395nn(e)] )is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

<blockquote>

===(9) Payments under certain incentive payment programs between hospitals and physicians– ===



====(A) In general– ====

In the case of a monetary incentive payment which is made by a hospital to a physician under an incentive payment program (as defined in subparagraph (B)) that meets requirements established by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] and the [[w:|Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services]] for purposes of this paragraph.

====(B) Incentive payment program defined– ====

In this paragraph, the term incentive payment program means a program that is designed to align incentives among hospitals and physicians (through techniques such as product standardization, the substitution of lower cost products, and care coordination initiatives that encourage medically appropriate decreases in length of stay) to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining or improving quality..

==(d) Safe harbor from antikickback and other Federal sanctions– ==


:(1)  Section 1128B(b)(3) of the Social Security Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1320a–7b 42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b(b)(3)] )is amended—
