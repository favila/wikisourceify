{{Center|A BILL}}

To protect the academic futures of collegiate student athletes.

=Section 1. Short title; findings; sense of Congress=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the “Collegiate Student Athlete Protection Act” .

==(b) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Institutions of higher education that have athletic programs that offer athletically related student aid collectively generate billions of dollars annually from contracts for media rights, and the revenue from such contracts would not exist without the efforts of student athletes.
:(2) Providing adequate health and safety protection for student athletes can help prevent serious injury and death.
:(3) Current and former student athletes are often left to pay for medical expenses incurred from injuries suffered while participating in intercollegiate athletics.

==(c) Sense of congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) institutions of higher education exist to further educate, and to provide an opportunity to acquire a degree to, all students who attend such institutions;
:(2) institutions of higher education should ensure that a sports-related injury does not hinder the opportunity of a student athlete to graduate from the institution of higher education the student athlete attends at the time of such injury;
:(3) institutions of higher education should make graduation of all student athletes a priority, regardless of the on-field performance of the student athletes;
:(4) institutions of higher education should provide student athletes with the same due process protections afforded to students who do not participate in athletics;
:(5) acknowledging the bodily risks taken by the student athletes, institutions of higher education should ensure that student athletes who otherwise could not afford proper health insurance are provided such insurance to pay for sports-related injuries; and
:(6) due to the record level of revenues that athletic programs provide for institutions of higher education, such institutions have the responsibility to provide student athletes with the highest level of education, and to provide effective efforts to ensure that student athletes attain higher education degrees from such institutions.

=Sec. 2. Program participation agreements=



==(a) New requirement for programs of assistance– ==

 Section 487(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1094 20 U.S.C. 1094(a)] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>
:(30) 
::(A) In the case of an institution that has an athletic program and that annually receives $10,000,000 or more in income derived from media rights (as calculated in accordance with subparagraph (B)) for the athletic program of the institution, the institution will comply with the requirements under subsection (k).
::(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, an institution of higher education shall calculate the total amount of income the institution derives annually from media rights by adding—
:::(i) annual income derived from any contract for media rights signed with any media entity by the institution, determined by averaging the income derived from the contract annually over the lifetime of the contract;
:::(ii) disbursements to the institution as a member institution of an athletic conference, representing member shares of the media rights of such conference; and
:::(iii) disbursements to the institution as a participant in an event that is hosted by an entity that—
::::(I) hosts intercollegiate sporting events; and
::::(II) sells broadcast or media access to that event..
