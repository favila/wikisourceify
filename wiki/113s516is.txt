{{Center|A BILL}}

 To reduce disparities and improve access to effective and cost efficient diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer through advances in testing, research, and education, including through telehealth, comparative effectiveness research, and identification of best practices in patient education and outreach particularly with respect to underserved racial, ethnic and rural populations and men with a family history of prostate cancer, to establish a directive on what constitutes clinically appropriate prostate cancer imaging, and to create a prostate cancer scientific advisory board for the Office of the Chief Scientist at the Food and Drug Administration to accelerate real-time sharing of the latest research and accelerate movement of new medicines to patients.   

=Section 1. Short Title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2013 ”or the“ PROSTATE Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men.
:(2) In 2010, more than 217,730 new patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 32,000 men died from this disease.
:(3) Roughly 2,000,000 Americans are living with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and its consequences.
:(4) While prostate cancer generally affects older individuals, younger men are also at risk for the disease, and when prostate cancer appears in early middle age it frequently takes on a more aggressive form.
:(5) There are significant racial and ethnic disparities that demand attention, namely African-Americans have prostate cancer mortality rates that are more than double those in the White population.
:(6) Underserved rural populations have higher rates of mortality compared to their urban counterparts, and innovative and cost-efficient methods to improve rural access to high quality care should take advantage of advances in telehealth to diagnose and treat prostate cancer when appropriate.
:(7) Certain veterans populations may have nearly twice the incidence of prostate cancer as the general population of the United States.
:(8) Urologists may constitute the specialists who diagnose and treat the vast majority of prostate cancer patients.
:(9) Although much basic and translational research has been completed and much is currently known, there are still many unanswered questions. For example, it is not fully understood how much of known disparities are attributable to disease etiology, access to care, or education and awareness in the community.
:(10) Causes of prostate cancer are not known. There is not good information regarding how to differentiate accurately, early on, between aggressive and indolent forms of the disease. As a result, there is significant overtreatment in prostate cancer. There are no treatments that can durably arrest growth or cure prostate cancer once it has metastasized.
:(11) A significant proportion (roughly 23 to 54 percent) of cases may be clinically indolent and overdiagnosed , resulting in significant overtreatment. More accurate tests will allow men and their families to face less physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma and billions of dollars could be saved in private and public health care systems in an area that has been identified by the Medicare program as one of eight high volume, high cost areas in the Resource Utilization Report program authorized by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]under the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 .
:(12) Prostate cancer research and health care programs across Federal agencies should be coordinated to improve accountability and actively encourage the translation of research into practice, to identify and implement best practices, in order to foster an integrated and consistent focus on effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease. 

=Sec. 3. Prostate cancer coordination and education=
