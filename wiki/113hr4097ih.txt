{{Center|A BILL}}

 To ensure that proper information gathering and planning are undertaken to secure the preservation and recovery of the salmon and steelhead of the Columbia River Basin in a manner that protects and enhances local communities, ensures effective expenditure of Federal resources, and maintains reasonably priced, reliable power, to direct the Secretary of Commerce to seek scientific analysis of Federal efforts to restore salmon and steelhead listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Salmon Solutions and Planning Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds and declares the following:
:(1) Thirteen salmon and steelhead species in the Columbia and Snake River Basin are listed for protection under the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq].)as a consequence of various factors, including the construction and operation of hydroelectric projects, harvest management practices, habitat degradation, altered in-stream flow regimes, and unsound hatchery practices.
:(2) The original range of Snake River salmon included not only their existing habitat, but also habitat in the upper Columbia River and the upper Snake River Basins, including southern Idaho, southeast Oregon, and northern Nevada.
:(3) Since the construction of 4 Federal dams on the lower Snake River in Washington, all salmon and steelhead populations in the Snake River are either already extinct or listed as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 .
:(4) Without action, climate change and rising water temperatures will continue to have detrimental effects on many North American coldwater fish species, including salmon and steelhead populations. Due to their high-elevation spawning grounds, Snake River salmon are key to maintaining and rebuilding those salmon populations threatened by rising water temperatures throughout the Columbia River Basin.
:(5) Salmon and steelhead populations have major economic, ecological, educational, recreational, scientific, cultural, and spiritual significance to the Nation and its people. Even at their current depressed population levels, these salmon and steelhead populations generate hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect benefits for communities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California; restoring these populations is estimated to generate billions of dollars in additional revenue for these States.
:(6) The United States has signed treaties with Indian tribes in Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho and with the Government of Canada, creating legally enforceable treaty obligations to restore salmon populations to sustainable and harvestable levels.
:(7) The Federal Government, the Bonneville Power Administration, and United States ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest have spent more than $11,000,000,000 on salmon recovery efforts in the Columbia and Snake River Basin to date.
:(8) A federally funded group of State, tribal, Federal, and independent scientists found that removing the 4 lower Snake River dams in Washington is the surest way to protect and recover these salmon and steelhead populations. Similar conclusions have been reached by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Commerce.
:(9) Significant sediment buildup behind the Lower Granite Dam poses a flood risk to the city of Lewiston, Idaho. A study by the Army Corps of Engineers found that nearly $2,000,000,000 worth of buildings and infrastructure face a growing threat of major damage from levee breaching. The same Corps study estimates that the costs of river-dredging and levee-raising needed to protect this area could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
:(10) A Federal court has found that all 4 lower Snake River dams violate water quality standards under the  Federal Water Pollution Control Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1251 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq].).
:(11) The removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams would open up more than 100 miles of free-flowing river ways to inland Northwest communities and provide needed resources for more effective and efficient freight transportation systems.
:(12) In the event the 4 lower Snake River dams are removed, their electricity generation, freight shipping, and water supply benefits must be replaced through other means in order to protect affected communities, farms, and the regional energy supply system; the dams' energy benefits should be replaced with cost-effective, clean renewable sources that focus on energy efficiency and conservation.
:(13) Studies have found that the Northwest has ample additional existing and potential clean renewable energy sources to replace the renewable electricity produced by the 4 lower Snake River dams in an environmentally sound and cost effective manner.
:(14) By completing the planning and evaluation required under this Act, the Northwest and the Nation will be better prepared to efficiently manage salmon recovery and ensure prompt implementation of Federal salmon recovery actions needed to protect and restore wild Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purpose of this Act are—
:(1) to ensure the protection and recovery of wild Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead to self-sustaining, harvestable levels, while providing for reliable, reasonably priced, clean renewable energy in the Northwest, a reliable and affordable freight transportation system, an economically sustainable salmon recovery program; and
:(2) to maximize the economic benefits of removal of the 4 lower Snake River dams while mitigating for its impacts.
