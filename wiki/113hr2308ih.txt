{{Center|A BILL}}

To direct the Secretary of Education to establish a program to provide grants for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator training in public elementary and secondary schools.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Teaching Children to Save Lives Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.
:(2) Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in young athletes.
:(3) Each year there are nearly 10,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children nationwide.
:(4) Receiving proper treatment known as the chain of survival can double or triple the chances of survival of a victim of cardiac arrest.
:(5) The 5 links in the chain of survival are prompt notification of emergency services, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (in this Act referred to as CPR ), rapid defibrillation, effective advanced life support, and integrated post-cardiac arrest care.
:(6) A person experiencing sudden cardiac arrest has a 90-percent chance of survival if CPR and an automated external defibrillator (in this Act referred to as AED ) are used within the first minute after collapse.
:(7) An important part of the education of school children is learning healthy behaviors, including proper nutrition and physical activity, and that education should also include basic emergency life-saving skills.
:(8) Teaching school children to recognize and respond to the signs of cardiac arrest, stroke, and choking and to perform the life-saving skill of CPR can improve their confidence in responding to an emergency and encourage continued efforts to update these skills after graduation, thereby potentially reducing the rate of death from sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, and choking.
