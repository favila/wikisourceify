                (B)
                Exception
                
                  Subparagraph (A) shall not apply with
				respect to service by any individual which is otherwise prohibited under such
				subparagraph if the appropriate Federal banking agency determines, by
				regulation with respect to a limited number of cases, that service by such
				individual as an officer, director, employee, or other institution-affiliated
				party of any insured depository institution would not unduly influence the
				investment policies of the depository institution or the advice the institution
				provides to customers.
							
              
                (C)
                Termination of

				wind-down of existing affiliation

				institution with any broker or dealer, any investment adviser, any investment
				company, or any other person, as of the date of the enactment of the Return to
				Prudent Banking Act of 2013, which is prohibited under paragraph (1) shall be
				terminated as soon as practicable and in any event no later than the end of the
				2-year period beginning on such date of enactment.
							
              
                (B)
                Early

				Federal banking agency, after opportunity for hearing, may terminate, at any
				time, the authority conferred by the preceding subparagraph to continue any
				affiliation subject to such subparagraph until the end of the period referred
				to in such subparagraph if the agency determines, having due regard for the
				purposes of this subsection and the Return to Prudent Banking Act of 2013, that
				such action is necessary to prevent undue concentration of resources, decreased
				or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices and
				is in the public interest.
							
              
                (C)

                Subject to a determination under
				subparagraph (B), an appropriate Federal banking agency may extend the 2-year
				period referred to in subparagraph (A) from time to time as to any particular
				insured depository institution for not more than 6 months at a time, if, in the

				public interest, but no such extensions shall in the aggregate exceed 1
				year.
							
            
            
              (4)
              Definitions
              For
				purposes of this subsection, the terms broker and
				dealer have the same meanings as in section 3(a) of the

			 amended by section 16 of the Banking Act of 1933 and subsequent amendments) and
			 
              section 21 of the Banking Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 378) by the Supreme Court of
			 the United States in the case of Investment Company Institute v. Camp (401 U.S.
			 617 et seq. (1971)) with regard to the permissible activities of banks and

			 Insurance Act (as added by subsection (a) of this section) except to the extent

			 application of such sections 20 and 32.
				
        
          (3)
          Limitation on
			 agency interpretation or judicial construction
          No appropriate Federal banking agency, by
			 regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, and no court within the
			 United States may construe the paragraph designated the Seventh
			 of section 5136 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C. 24
            , as
			 amended by section 16 of the Banking Act of 1933 and subsequent amendments),
			 section 21 of the Banking Act of 1933, or section 18(aa) of the Federal Deposit
			 Insurance Act more narrowly than the reasoning of the 
                [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court of the
			 United States]]
             in the case of Investment Company Institute v. Camp (401 U.S. 617

				limitation of the January 1, 1970, approval deadline in subsection (c)(8), the

				standards
                In making any
				determination under paragraph (1), the Board shall consider whether performance
				of the activity by a bank holding company or a subsidiary of such company can
				reasonably be expected to result in a violation of section 18(aa) of the
				Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 21 of the Banking Act of 1933, or the
				spirit of section 2(c) of the Return to Prudent Banking Act of 2013, and other
				possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
				or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking
				practices.

				notice of the determination has been submitted to both Houses of the 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
            
				together with a detailed explanation of the activities to which the
				determination relates and the basis for the determination, unless before the
