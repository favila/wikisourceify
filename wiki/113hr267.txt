{{section|HEB0C3F732399484FB3083800D50BF481|2. Findings}}
Congress finds that—
(1)
the hydropower industry currently employs
			 approximately 300,000 workers across the United States;

(2)
hydropower is the
			 largest source of clean, renewable electricity in the United States;

(3)
as of the date of enactment of this Act,
			 hydropower resources, including pumped storage facilities, provide—
(A)
nearly 7 percent of the electricity
			 generated in the United States; and

(B)
approximately 100,000 megawatts of electric
			 capacity in the United States;


(4)
only 3 percent of
			 the 80,000 dams in the United States generate electricity, so there is
			 substantial potential for adding hydropower generation to nonpowered dams;
			 and

(5)
according to one study, by utilizing
			 currently untapped resources, the United States could add approximately 60,000
			 megawatts of new hydropower capacity by 2025, which could create 700,000 new
			 jobs over the next 13 years.

{{section|HDB268F484CCD42DF9AEB2807D34D1246|6. Promoting hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects}}
(a)
In
			 general
To improve the regulatory process and reduce delays and
			 costs for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped
			 storage projects, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (referred to in this
			 section as the Commission
) shall investigate the feasibility of
			 the issuance of a license for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and
			 closed loop pumped storage projects in a 2-year period (referred to in this
			 section as a 2-year process
). Such a 2-year process shall include
			 any prefiling licensing process of the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]].

(b)
Workshops and
			 pilots
The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] shall—
(1)
not later than 60
			 days after the date of enactment of this Act, hold an initial workshop to
			 solicit public comment and recommendations on how to implement a 2-year
			 process;

(2)
develop criteria
			 for identifying projects featuring hydropower development at nonpowered dams
			 and closed loop pumped storage projects that may be appropriate for licensing
			 within a 2-year process;

(3)
not later than 180
			 days after the date of enactment of this Act, develop and implement pilot
			 projects to test a 2-year process, if practicable; and

(4)
not later than 3
			 years after the date of implementation of the final pilot project testing a
			 2-year process, hold a final workshop to solicit public comment on the
			 effectiveness of each tested 2-year process.


(c)
Memorandum of
			 understanding
The [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] shall, to the extent practicable,
			 enter into a memorandum of understanding with any applicable Federal or State
			 agency to implement a pilot project described in subsection (b)
.

(d)
Reports
(1)
Pilot projects
			 not implemented
If the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] determines that no pilot
			 project described in subsection (b)
 is practicable because no 2-year process is
			 practicable, not later than 240 days after the date of enactment of this Act,
			 the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the
			 House of Representatives
 and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of
			 the Senate
 a report that—
(A)
describes the
			 public comments received as part of the initial workshop held under subsection
			 (b)(1)
; and

(B)
identifies the
			 process, legal, environmental, economic, and other issues that justify the
			 determination of the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] that no 2-year process is practicable, with
			 recommendations on how [[United States Congress|Congress]] may address or remedy the identified
			 issues.


(2)
Pilot projects
			 implemented
If the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] develops and implements pilot
			 projects involving a 2-year process, not later than 60 days after the date of
			 completion of the final workshop held under subsection (b)(4)
, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]]
			 shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
			 Representatives
 and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate

			 a report that—
(A)
describes the
			 outcomes of the pilot projects;

(B)
describes the
			 public comments from the final workshop on the effectiveness of each tested
			 2-year process; and

(C)
(i)
outlines how the
			 [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] will adopt policies under existing law (including regulations) that
			 result in a 2-year process for appropriate projects;

(ii)
outlines how the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] will
			 issue new regulations to adopt a 2-year process for appropriate projects;
			 or

(iii)
identifies the process, legal,
			 environmental, economic, and other issues that justify a determination of the
			 [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] that no 2-year process is practicable, with recommendations on how
			 [[United States Congress|Congress]] may address or remedy the identified issues.





{{section|HE7F3E17E18F74F70A3D1E078838DE4D7|7. DOE study of pumped storage and potential hydropower from conduits}}
(a)
In
			 general
The [[United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] shall conduct a study—
(1)
(A)
of the technical
			 flexibility that existing pumped storage facilities can provide to support
			 intermittent renewable electric energy generation, including the potential for
			 such existing facilities to be upgraded or retrofitted with advanced
			 commercially available technology; and

(B)
of the technical potential of existing
			 pumped storage facilities and new advanced pumped storage facilities, to
			 provide grid reliability benefits; and


(2)
(A)
to identify the range of
			 opportunities for hydropower that may be obtained from conduits (as defined by
			 the [[United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]) in the United States; and

(B)
through case studies, to assess
			 amounts of potential energy generation from such conduit hydropower
			 projects.



(b)
Report
Not
			 later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[United States Department of Energy|Secretary of
			 Energy]] shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
			 Representatives
 and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate

			 a report that describes the results of the study conducted under subsection
			 (a)
, including any recommendations.
