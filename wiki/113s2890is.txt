{{Center|A BILL}}

 To authorize the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to establish a constituent-driven program that develops an information platform capable of efficiently integrating coastal data with decision-support tools, training, and best practices, and coordinates the collection of priority coastal geospatial data to inform and improve local, State, regional, and Federal capacities to manage the coastal region, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Digital Coast Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) The Digital Coast is a model approach for effective Federal partnerships with State and local government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.
:(2) Access to current, accurate, uniform, and standards-based geospatial information, tools, and training to characterize the United States coastal region is critical for public safety and for the environment, infrastructure, and economy of the United States.
:(3) More than half of all people of the United States (153,000,000) currently live on or near a coast and an additional 12,000,000 are expected in the next decade.
:(4) Coastal counties in the United States average 300 persons per square mile, compared with the national average of 98.
:(5) On a typical day, more than 1,540 permits for construction of single-family homes are issued in coastal counties, combined with other commercial, retail, and institutional construction to support this population.
:(6) Over half of the economic productivity of the United States is located within coastal regions.
:(7) Highly accurate, high-resolution remote sensing and other geospatial data play an important role in management of the coastal zone and economy, including for—
::(A) flood and coastal storm surge prediction;
::(B) hazard risk and vulnerability assessment;
::(C) emergency response and recovery planning;
::(D) community resilience to longer range climate change impacts;
::(E) permitting and zoning decisionmaking;
::(F) habitat and ecosystem health assessments; and
::(G) landscape change detection. 

=Sec. 3. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Coastal region– ==

The term coastal region means the area of United States waters extending inland from the shoreline to include coastal watersheds and seaward to the territorial sea.

==(2) Coastal State– ==

The term coastal State —
:(A) means a State of the United States in, or bordering on, the Atlantic, Pacific, or Arctic Ocean, the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, Long Island Sound, or one or more of the Great Lakes; and
:(B) includes Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, and any portion of a State that is located within the designated coastal zone of the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, or the Great Lakes.

==(3) Digital Coast– ==

The term Digital Coast means a constituent-driven effort led by the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]to provide an enabling platform that integrates geospatial data, decision-support tools, training, and best practices to address coastal management issues and needs. The Digital Coast strives to enhance resilient communities, ecosystem values, and coastal economic growth and development by helping communities address their issues, needs, and challenges through cost-effective and participatory solutions.

==(4) Federal Geographic Data Committee– ==

The term Federal Geographic Data Committee means the interagency committee that promotes the coordinated development, use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data on a national basis.

==(5) Remote sensing and other geospatial– ==

The term remote sensing and other geospatial means collecting, storing, retrieving, or disseminating graphical or digital data depicting natural or manmade physical features, phenomena, or boundaries of the Earth and any information related thereto, including surveys, maps, charts, satellite and airborne remote sensing data, images, LiDAR, and services performed by professionals such as surveyors, photogrammetrists, hydrographers, geodesists, cartographers, and other such services.

==(6) Secretary– ==

The term Secretary means the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], acting through the [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]. 

=Sec. 4. Building the digital coast=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]shall establish Digital Coast as a program that provides data integration, tool development, training, documentation, dissemination, and archive by—
:(1) making data and resulting integrated products developed under this section readily accessible via the Digital Coast Internet website of the [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], the GeoPlatform.gov and data.gov Internet websites, and such other Internet technologies as the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]considers appropriate;
:(2) developing decision-support tools that use and display resulting integrated data and provide training on use of such tools;
:(3) documenting such data to Federal Geographic Data Committee standards; and
:(4) archiving all raw data acquired under this Act at the appropriate [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]data center or such other Federal data center as the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]considers appropriate.

==(b) Coordination– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]]shall coordinate the activities carried out pursuant to this Act to maximize data collection, sharing and integration, and to minimize duplication by—
