{{Center|A BILL}}

 To ensure that programs of training services under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 make better use of participants’ prior learning so as to better assist the participants in obtaining degrees and other recognized postsecondary credentials, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Leverage Prior Skills Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings; purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) A recognized postsecondary credential is key to an individual’s self-sufficiency and upward mobility, and to higher levels of family well-being.
:(2) Jobseekers often come to programs providing training services with skills acquired through noncredit employment and training programs, such as corporate or military training programs, workplace-based learning programs, volunteer activities, and other activities.
:(3) Workforce investment systems do not take into account prior learning. Workers and students who have persisted through demanding noncredit employment and training programs often have to repeat courses when they attempt to earn a recognized postsecondary credential through a workforce investment system, wasting both money and time.
:(4) At a time when unemployment remains relatively high, training services should be geared to allow participants to quickly achieve recognized postsecondary credentials that lead directly to employment.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to encourage States and local boards to develop competency-based workforce investment systems, to validate learning through noncredit employment and training programs and to award recognized postsecondary credentials.
