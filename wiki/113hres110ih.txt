=={{anchor|HDECA1F4C67A8468A9CFEA6FC2AD9252C}}(a) Short Title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“Public Access to Congressional Research Service Reports Resolution of 2013”or the“Congressional Research Service Electronic Accessibility Resolution of 2013”.

=={{anchor|HF432EF6CB3A04A88A51EF6F6663247A6}}(b) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:Library of Congress|Congressional Research Service]] , a special reference unit within the [[w:Library of Congress|Library of Congress]] , offers invaluable research and analysis to Members of Congress on all current and emerging issues of national policy.
:(2) The [[w:Library of Congress|Congressional Research Service]] staff of approximately 700 employees, including lawyers, economists, reference librarians, and social, natural, and physical scientists, are governed by requirements for accuracy, objectivity, balance, and nonpartisanship.
:(3) The [[w:Library of Congress|Congressional Research Service]] has a responsibility to ensure that Members of Congress have available the best possible information and analysis on which to base the policy decisions the American people have elected them to make.
:(4) It is often burdensome, difficult, and time-consuming for citizens to obtain access to objective and nonpartisan policy analysis on issues affecting their interests.
:(5) It will enhance our democracy to provide citizens with access to unbiased and accurate [[w:Library of Congress|CRS]] documents on legislation and other critical issues before [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] .
:(6) Allowing public access to [[w:Library of Congress|CRS]] will empower citizens and enable Members of Congress to become even more effective “representatives” of the public’s concerns and goals.
