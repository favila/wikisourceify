=Section 1. Short title=

=Sec. 2. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Fiscal gap– ==

The term fiscal gap means an economic analysis that—
:(A) calculates the difference between the present value of all projected future Federal spending, including interest and principal payments on the initial outstanding debt, and the present value of all projected future Federal revenues, over an infinite time horizon;
:(B) calculates the permanent Federal revenue increases and spending reductions and identifies the combination of fiscal policy options starting in the budget year, and 5, 10, 15, and 25 years after the budget year, needed to eliminate the infinite horizon fiscal gap calculated as of the budget year; and
:(C) calculates the increases in the levels of annual rates of economic growth factors, including technological change, labor productivity, and capital deepening, starting in the budget year, and 5, 10, 15, and 25 years after the budget year, needed to eliminate the infinite horizon fiscal gap calculated as of the budget year.

==(2) Generation– ==

The term generation means a 1-year age cohort.

==(3) Generational accounting– ==

The term generational accounting means an economic analysis that calculates—
:(A) the projected present value lifetime net Federal tax burden facing each living adult generation over 18 years of age; and
:(B) the present value lifetime net Federal tax burdens facing each current generation of children 18 years of age and under, as well as each future generation, assuming—
::(i) the sum of all present value lifetime net Federal tax burdens facing each current generation of children 18 years of age and under, as well as each future generation, covers the present value of future discretionary spending, including interest and principal payments on the initial outstanding debt, less the sum of all present value lifetime net Federal tax burdens facing living adult generations over 18 years of age; and
::(ii) the lifetime net Federal tax burden of generations 18 years of age and under, as well as future generations, increases with year of birth at the projected growth rate of labor productivity.

==(4) Net Federal tax burden– ==

The term net Federal tax burden means the difference between Federal taxes paid and transfer payments received.
