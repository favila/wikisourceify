=Sec. 3. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) the Constitution of the United States invests in Congress the authority to manage Federal lands and the natural resources contained within them;
:(2) the natural resources contained within lands owned by the Federal Government are ultimately owned by the people, and can be explored and developed by them in their pursuit of happiness to fuel the American way of life;
:(3) the United States spends over $1,000,000,000 per day to import crude oil from foreign countries, representing the largest wealth transfer in history;
:(4) the domestic oil and natural gas industry is responsible for approximately 9.2 million jobs;
:(5) the United States has substantial undeveloped oil and natural gas resources underlying Federal lands;
:(6) multiple legal challenges relating to the leasing, exploration, and development of Federal lands can significantly delay and even prevent these desperately needed oil and natural gas resources from reaching the American public;
:(7) expedited and focused judicial review of legal challenges to proposed oil and natural gas development activities is necessary to ensure that additional American oil and natural gas resources are made available without undue delay to American consumers;
:(8) the approximately 43 million leased outer Continental Shelf acres currently account for about 15 percent of the United States domestic natural gas production and about 27 percent of the United States domestic oil production;
:(9) the leasing of these domestic offshore areas for oil and natural gas development provides significant economic benefits to the Federal Government, as well as to States and localities, through the creation and sustenance of jobs and domestic product;
:(10) the Federal Government distributed over $10,000,000,000 to Federal, State and Indian accounts from energy production during fiscal year 2009, primarily from oil and natural gas production;
:(11) the outer Continental Shelf is a vital national resource reserve held by the Federal Government for the public, which should be made available for expeditious and orderly development, subject to environmental safeguards, in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of competition and other national needs;
:(12) Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, issued on January 18, 2011, requires that to the extent permitted by law, each agency must, among other things—
::(A) propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that its benefits justify its costs (recognizing that some benefits and costs are difficult to quantify);
::(B) tailor its regulations to impose the least burden on society, consistent with obtaining regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other things, and to the extent practicable, the costs of cumulative regulations;
::(C) select, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, those approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity);
::(D) to the extent feasible, specify performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt; and
::(E) identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees or marketable permits, or providing information upon which choices can be made by the public;
:(13) Executive Order 13547 on Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes, issued on July 19, 2010, provides for the development of coastal and marine spatial plans (CMSP) that build upon and improve existing Federal, State, tribal, local, and regional decisionmaking and planning processes;
:(14) the  Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/1331 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq].)already provides a comprehensive and complete framework for undertaking oil and gas activities within the framework of a CMSP-based program;
:(15) through the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Congress has already established the process for development of coastal and marine spatial plans for oil and gas leasing and other authorizations, and it is not necessary to create a new regulatory regime as this would go against the Executive order;
:(16) the Coastal Plain of Alaska is an important potential new source of domestic oil and gas production;
:(17) the delivery of oil from Alberta, Canada, to domestic markets in the United States is in the national interest of the United States, and the earliest possible completion of the Keystone XL pipeline will best serve the national interest;
:(18) there are 103 nuclear reactors currently operating in the United States, providing 20 percent of the electricity of the United States, slightly less than the electricity generated by natural gas;
:(19) nuclear energy is the largest provider of clean, low-carbon electricity, almost 8 times larger than all renewable power production combined, excluding hydroelectric power;
:(20) nuclear power is responsible for 72 percent of emission-free electricity production in the United States;
:(21) nuclear power plants virtually eliminate emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants associated with acid rain, smog, or ozone;
:(22) nuclear energy supplies consistent, baseload electricity, independent of environmental conditions;
:(23) between 1960 and 1980, the [[w:Nuclear Regulatory Commission|Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]issued 169 permits to construct nuclear power facilities;
:(24) even if every nuclear power plant is granted a 20-year extension, all currently operating nuclear power plants will be retired by 2055;
:(25) long lead times for nuclear power plant licensing, permitting, and construction indicate that action to stimulate the nuclear power industry should not be delayed;
:(26) there are 17 combined operating license applications currently pending before the [[w:Nuclear Regulatory Commission|Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]for 26 new reactors in the United States, with 4 applications inactive due to regulatory uncertainty;

==Sec. 707. Clarification of legal enforcement against noncriminal energy producers==



===(a) Findings– ===

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) was enacted in 1918 to protect the migratory bird population from overhunting and poaching and has not been updated to reflect the societal changes that have occurred in our Nation over the last 95 years.
:(2) Anyone involved in an otherwise legal activity may be subject to criminal liability for the unintentional death of any one of over 1,000 species of birds protected under the MBTA.
:(3) The  Act of June 8, 1940 (chapter 278; [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/668 16 U.S.C. 668] ), popularly known as the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), was first enacted in 1940 to protect the dwindling population of bald eagles and amended in 1962 to cover golden eagles in order to provide additional protective measures for bald eagles and for other purposes.
:(4) The BGEPA includes a program for the Federal Government to issue permits in order to protect companies from legal liability if eagles are unintentionally injured or killed, but the Federal Government has failed to issue permits issued under the program.
:(5) Among other goals, the BGEPA’s permit program was established to assure the protection of interests fundamental to the basic operation of our society like agriculture and energy infrastructure development and maintenance.
:(6) The BGEPA was successful in helping the overall eagle population recover, leading to bald eagles being removed from the list of threatened and endangered species in 2007.
:(7) There are differing legal and judicial interpretations regarding the scope of criminality in those statutes.
:(8) It appears criminal prosecution under those statutes has been subjective, selective, and not applied uniformly and fairly across all sectors of society.
:(9) Those statutes need to be updated to reflect significant changes in our Nation over the last half century, including the urbanization of rural areas and how domestic energy is produced, transmitted, and distributed.
:(10) Protecting the avian population and its habitat is important.
:(11) Federal enforcement actions should be appropriate, uniform, nondiscriminatory, and just.

===(b) Permits for incidental take– ===

   Section 1 of the Act of June 8, 1940 (chapter 278; [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/668 16 U.S.C. 668] ), popularly known as the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 

====(d) Permits for incidental take– ====

Upon submission of a substantially completed application, the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]]shall issue or deny an eagle take permit for no less than 30 years undersection 22.26of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, that authorizes taking of any bald eagle or golden eagle that is incidental to, but not the purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity. Failure to issue or deny such a permit within a reasonable time (which shall not exceed one year) is deemed issuance of such permit, and the applicant shall not be subject to liability for any incidental take of a bald eagle or golden eagle that is in conformity with the information submitted to the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]]as part of the application for the permit. . 
</blockquote>


===(c) Migratory Bird Treaty Act– ===

   Section 6(a) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/707 16 U.S.C. 707(a)] )is amended—

:::(II) an area in another State that the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]has found to be significantly contributing to nonattainment in the downwind area in violation of section 110(a)(2)(D) and for which the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]has established requirements through notice and comment rulemaking to reduce the emissions causing such significant contribution.
:(B) The term“current classification”means the classification of a downwind area under this section at the time of the determination under paragraph (2).

====(2) Extension– ====

Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), a downwind area that is not in attainment within 18 months of the attainment deadline required under this section may seek an extension of time to come into attainment by petitioning the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]for such an extension. If the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]—
:(A) determines that the area is a downwind area with respect to a particular national ambient air quality standard for ozone;
:(B) approves a plan revision for such area as provided in paragraph (3) prior to a reclassification under subsection (b)(2)(A); and
:(C) determines that the petitioning downwind area has demonstrated that it is affected by transport from an upwind area to a degree that affects the area’s ability to attain,the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], in lieu of such reclassification, may extend the attainment date for such downwind area for such standard in accordance with paragraph (5).

====(3) Approval– ====

In order to extend the attainment date for a downwind area under this subsection, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]may approve a revision of the applicable implementation plan for the downwind area for the national ambient air quality standard that—
:(A) complies with all requirements of this Act applicable under the current classification of the downwind area, including any requirements applicable to the area under section 172(c) for such standard;
:(B) includes any additional measures needed to demonstrate attainment by the extended attainment date provided under this subsection, and provides for implementation of those measures as expeditiously as practicable; and
:(C) provides appropriate measures to ensure that no area downwind of the area receiving the extended attainment date will be affected by transport to a degree that affects the other area’s ability to attain.

====(4) Prior reclassification determination– ====

If, after April 1, 2003, and prior to the time the 1-hour ozone standard no longer applies to a downwind area, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]made a reclassification determination under subsection (b)(2)(A) for such downwind area, and the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]approves a plan consistent with subparagraphs (A) and (B) for such area, the reclassification shall be withdrawn and, for purposes of implementing the 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard, the area shall be treated as if the reclassification never occurred. Such plan must be submitted no later than 12 months following enactment of this subsection, and—
:(A) the plan revision for the downwind area must comply with all control and planning requirements of this Act applicable under the classification that applied immediately prior to reclassification, including any requirements applicable to the area under section 172(c) for such standard; and
:(B) the plan must include any additional measures needed to demonstrate attainment no later than the date on which the last reductions in pollution transport that have been found by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]to significantly contribute to nonattainment are required to be achieved by the upwind area or areas.

====(5) Extended date– ====

The attainment date extended under this subsection shall provide for attainment of such national ambient air quality standard for ozone in the downwind area as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the new date that the area would have been subject to had it been reclassified under subsection (b)(2).

====(6) Rulemaking– ====

Within 12 months after the enactment of this subsection, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall, after notice and comment, promulgate rules to determine, for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), when an area is affected by transport to a degree that affects the area’s ability to attain. The purpose of such rules shall be to ensure that downwind areas are not unjustly penalized. .
