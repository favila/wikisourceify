 Recognizing the National Museum of World War II Aviation in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as America’s National World War II Aviation Museum.    Whereas World War II was one of the most important events in the history of the Nation, a time of moral clarity and common purpose that remains today as an inspiration to all people in the United States;   Whereas the role of aviation was a critical factor in the success of winning World War II and defeating the enemies worldwide;   Whereas the bravery, courage, dedication, and heroism of World War II aviators and support personnel was an important element in the winning of World War II;   Whereas the National Museum of World War II Aviation in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is the only museum in the United States that exists to exclusively preserve and promote an understanding of the role of aviation in winning World War II; and   Whereas the National Museum of World War II Aviation is dedicated to celebrating the spirit of the United States, recognizing the teamwork, collaboration, patriotism, and courage of the men and women who fought, as well as those on the homefront who mobilized and supported the national aviation effort: Now, therefore, be it
