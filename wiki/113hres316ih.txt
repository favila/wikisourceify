{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing heartfelt condolences and support to the people of India and all those affected in the aftermath of the deadly flash floods and landslides triggered by massive monsoons of June 2013, which devastated many states in northern India.    Whereas, in June 2013, flash floods were caused by the heaviest rains in 80 years, causing lakes, streams, and rivers to overflow throughout northern India;   Whereas these torrential rains washed away homes, electrical poles, and roads and triggered landslides that cut off communication links with large parts of the states in northern India affected;   Whereas the flooding claimed thousands of lives, while tens of thousands are still missing and even more are displaced;   Whereas rescue and relief efforts have been hampered by continuous rain, mist, and fog;   Whereas these floods swept through many of the holy Himalayan pilgrimage sites, including Yamunotri, Gangotri, Badrinath, Kedarnath, and Hemkund Sahib, where thousands of devout pilgrims were traveling;   Whereas the full extent of the tremendous loss of life and extensive destruction of property will not be known for some time;   Whereas the people of India have shown incredible determination to continue to help one another despite the risks and have displayed selflessness and compassion in the face of danger; and   Whereas countries around the world, international groups, and private citizens have made a commitment to provide humanitarian assistance and aid for the people of India: Now, therefore, be it
