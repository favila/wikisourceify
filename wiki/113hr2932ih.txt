The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:

:(2) Congress created the Coast Guard on January 28, 1915, by merging the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service, was moved to the Department of Transportation in 1967, and on February 25, 2003, became part of the Department of Homeland Security.
:(3) Although the smallest of the uniformed services, today the United States Coast Guard conducts a wide variety of missions to protect the public, the environment, and the United States economic and security interests in any maritime region, including international waters and America’s coasts, ports, and inland waterways.
:(4) Every day, the United States Coast Guard plays a broad and important role in homeland security, law enforcement, search and rescue, marine environmental pollution response, and the maintenance of river, intra-coastal and offshore aids to navigation (ATON).
:(5) The United States Coast Guard is our Nation’s oldest seasoning military service, staying true to their motto, Semper Paratus or “Always Ready,” for 223 years.
:(6) The United States Coast Guard has an estimated 42,300 men and women on active duty, who in 2012 responded to nearly 20,000 search and rescue incidents saving over 3,500 lives and protecting $77 million in property, removed 107 metric tons of cocaine and 56 metric tons of marijuana headed to the United States, and interdicted nearly 3,000 undocumented migrants on the high seas attempting to illegally enter the United States.
:(7) [[Public Law 108-293|Section 213 ofPublic Law 108–293]] states that “The Commandant may establish a National Coast Guard Museum, on lands which will be federally owned and administered by the Coast Guard, and are located in New London, Connecticut, at, or in close proximity to, the Coast Guard Academy” .
:(8) The National Coast Guard Museum Association, a nonprofit association dedicated to improve public understanding of the history, service and missions of the Coast Guard, is working with the United States Coast Guard, the City of New London, the State of Connecticut, and a range of local, regional, and national stakeholders to develop, plan and raise capital for the National Coast Guard Museum, to be located in New London, Connecticut.
