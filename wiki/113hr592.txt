[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Hurricane Sandy
			 inflicted catastrophic damage in the Northeastern United States.
:(2) Houses of worship across the Northeast’s
			 many faiths and denominations were among the private nonprofit facilities that
			 sustained damage.
:(3) Churches,
			 synagogues, mosques, temples, and other houses of worship throughout
			 communities in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and elsewhere play an
			 essential role in the daily lives of the communities.
:(4) The [[Wikipedia:Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal
			 Emergency Management Agency’s]] (FEMA) public assistance program provides
			 financial grants for the repair of various types of private nonprofit
			 facilities.
:(5) Among the types of nonprofits to which [[Wikipedia:Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]
			 provides such grants are those in which citizens gather and engage in a variety
			 of educational, enrichment, and social activities. These activities are
			 essential to community building and occur in houses of worship.
:(6) Under the Robert
			 T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et
			 seq.), FEMA’s disaster relief program is a general government program under
			 which assistance is provided in the wake of a natural disaster using criteria
			 that are neutral with regard to religion.
:(7) [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] has
			 previously enacted legislation providing financial assistance to religious
			 nonprofit institutions, including houses of worship, on terms equal to other
			 eligible nonprofit institutions.
:(8) Such legislation
			 is consistent with recent precedents of the [[Wikipedia:Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court of the United States]]
			 and legal opinions issued by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Justice|Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of
			 Justice]].
