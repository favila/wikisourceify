{{section|HD6EEBDBA4BE5497984E38BD79E586EFE|2. Findings}}
[[United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
(1)
Hurricane Sandy
			 inflicted catastrophic damage in the Northeastern United States.

(2)
Houses of worship across the Northeast’s
			 many faiths and denominations were among the private nonprofit facilities that
			 sustained damage.

(3)
Churches,
			 synagogues, mosques, temples, and other houses of worship throughout
			 communities in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and elsewhere play an
			 essential role in the daily lives of the communities.

(4)
The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal
			 Emergency Management Agency’s]] (FEMA) public assistance program provides
			 financial grants for the repair of various types of private nonprofit
			 facilities.

(5)
Among the types of nonprofits to which [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]
			 provides such grants are those in which citizens gather and engage in a variety
			 of educational, enrichment, and social activities. These activities are
			 essential to community building and occur in houses of worship.

(6)
Under the Robert
			 T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act
 (42 U.S.C. 5121 et
			 seq.
)
, FEMA’s disaster relief program is a general government program under
			 which assistance is provided in the wake of a natural disaster using criteria
			 that are neutral with regard to religion.

(7)
[[United States Congress|Congress]] has
			 previously enacted legislation providing financial assistance to religious
			 nonprofit institutions, including houses of worship, on terms equal to other
			 eligible nonprofit institutions.

(8)
Such legislation
			 is consistent with recent precedents of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court of the United States]]
			 and legal opinions issued by the [[United States Department of Justice|Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of
			 Justice]].
