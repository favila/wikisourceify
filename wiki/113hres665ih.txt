{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Condemning the murder of Israeli and Palestinian children in Israel and the ongoing and escalating violence in that country.    Whereas on April 23, 2014, the Palestinian factions of Fatah and Hamas announced a deal to unify Palestinian Authority rule over the West Bank and Gaza and to hold elections;   Whereas Hamas has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007 and is a designated terrorist organization by the governments of the United States, Israel, Canada, Japan, Jordan and Egypt, as well as the European Union;   Whereas Hamas does not recognize Israel’s right to exist and its charter calls for the destruction of the Jewish State;   Whereas Israel remains a strategic partner and ally since its establishment in 1948 and is a vibrant democracy with a strong rule of law situated in a hostile neighborhood in the Levant;   Whereas Israel has the right to self-defense as declared in Article 51 of the Charter of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]];   Whereas Israelis Naftali Frenkel, 16, Gilad Shaer, 16, and Eyal Yifrach, 19, were kidnapped on June 12, 2014, and subsequently murdered by two suspected Hamas members in the West Bank;   Whereas Israel launched Operation Brother’s Keeper to first retrieve the young boys and then to infiltrate and destroy Hamas’ network in the West Bank;   Whereas Palestinian Mohammed Abu Khdeir, 16, was abducted and killed in a retaliatory act by extremists on July 2, 2014, in Jerusalem;   Whereas Israeli political leaders strongly denounced the killing of Mohammed Abu Khdeir, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stating:“I unequivocally condemn the murder of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem …”and“Murder, riots, incitement, vigilantism — they have no place in our democracy.”;   Whereas Hamas continues to perpetuate violence against Israel, launching hundreds of rocket attacks on large population centers in Israel from Gaza;   Whereas Israel has made numerous efforts to avoid conflict through a proposed“quiet for quiet”formula which Hamas explicitly rejected; and   Whereas the Israel Defense Force consequently initiated Operation Protective Edge to respond to these ongoing threats to Israeli citizens: Now, therefore, be it
