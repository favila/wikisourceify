No State or local jurisdiction shall impose multiple or discriminatory taxes on the sale or use of a digital good or a digital service.

Subject to section 6(a), taxes on the sale of a digital good or a digital service may only be imposed by a State or local jurisdiction whose territorial limits encompass the customer tax address.

=Sec. 4. Customer tax address=



==(a) Seller obligation– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Subject to subsection (e)(2), a seller shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining in the ordinary course of business the customer tax address with respect to the sale of a digital good or a digital service, and shall be responsible for collecting and remitting the correct amount of tax for the State and local jurisdictions whose territorial limits encompass the customer tax address if the State has the authority to require such collection and remittance by the seller.

===(2) Certain transactions– ===

When a customer tax address is not a business location of the seller under clause (i) of section 7(2)(A)—
:(A) if the sale is a separate and discrete transaction, then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a customer tax address, as such efforts are described in clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 7(2)(A), before resorting to using a customer tax address as determined by clause (vi) of such section 7(2)(A); and
:(B) if the sale is not a separate and discrete transaction, then a seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a customer tax address, as such efforts are described in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of section 7(2)(A), before resorting to using a customer tax address as determined by clause (vi) of such section 7(2)(A).

==(b) Reliance on customer-Povided information– ==

A seller that relies in good faith on information provided by a customer to determine a customer tax address shall not be held liable for any additional tax based on a different determination of that customer tax address by a State or local jurisdiction or court of competent jurisdiction, except if and until binding notice is given as provided in subsection (c).

==(c) Address correction– ==

If a State or local jurisdiction is authorized under State law to administer a tax, and the jurisdiction determines that the customer tax address determined by a seller is not the customer tax address that would have been determined under section 7(2)(A)if the seller had the additional information provided by the State or local jurisdiction, then the jurisdiction may give binding notice to the seller to correct the customer tax address on a prospective basis, effective not less than 45 days after the date of such notice, if—
:(1) when the determination is made by a local jurisdiction, such local jurisdiction obtains the consent of all affected local jurisdictions within the State before giving such notice of determination; and
:(2) before the State or local jurisdiction gives such notice of determination, the customer is given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable State or local tax administrative procedures that the address used is the customer tax address.

==(d) Coordination with sourcing of mobile telecommunications service– ==



===(1) In general– ===

If—
:(A) a digital good or a digital service is sold to a customer by a home service provider of mobile telecommunications service that is subject to being sourced under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/117 section 117 of title 4, United States Code] , or the charges for a digital good or a digital service are billed to the customer by such a home service provider; and
:(B) the digital good or digital service is delivered, transferred, or provided electronically by means of mobile telecommunications service that is deemed to be provided by such home service provider under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/117 section 117 of such title] ,then the home service provider and, if different, the seller of the digital good or digital service, may presume that the customer’s place of primary use for such mobile telecommunications service is the customer tax address described in section 7(2)(B)with respect to the sale of such digital good or digital service.

===(2) Definitions– ===

For purposes of this subsection, the terms “home service provider” , “mobile telecommunications service” , and “place of primary use” have the same meanings as in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/124 section 124of title 4, United States Code] .

==(e) Multiple locations– ==



===(1) In general– ===

If a digital good or a digital service is sold to a customer and available for use by the customer in multiple locations simultaneously, the seller may determine the customer tax addresses using a reasonable and consistent method based on the addresses of use as provided by the customer and determined in agreement with the customer at the time of sale.

===(2) Direct customer payment– ===



====(A) Establishment of direct payment procedures– ====

Each State and local jurisdiction shall provide reasonable procedures that permit the direct payment by a qualified customer, as determined under procedures established by the State or local jurisdiction, of taxes that are on the sale of digital goods and digital services to multiple locations of the customer and that would, absent such procedures, be required or permitted by law to be collected from the customer by the seller.

====(B) Effect of customer compliance with direct payment procedures– ====

When a qualified customer elects to pay tax directly under the procedures established under subparagraph (A), the seller shall—

==(b) Digital code– ==

The tax treatment of the sale of a digital code shall be the same as the tax treatment of the sale of the digital good or digital service to which the digital code relates.
