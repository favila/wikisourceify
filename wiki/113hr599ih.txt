==(a) Transfer of conventional arms– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that it should be the policy of the United States to maintain adherence to a policy of restraint in transferring conventional arms if evidence exists of substantial risk that such arms will be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law.

==(b) Arms control agreements– ==

In furtherance of the policy described in subsection (a), the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] , in negotiating any conventional arms control agreement, should undertake a concerted effort—

:(2) to conduct an effective inquiry and meaningful assessment of each application or proposal for authorization to export or internationally transfer arms on a case-by-case basis;
:(3) to deny an arms transfer authorization if there is a substantial risk that the arms will be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law and to ensure such denial remains in place until steps are taken to mitigate the level of risk;
:(4) to require import and transit state authorizations, and certified end use assurances, before issuing an export license or authorization for any international transfer of conventional arms and to ensure minimum details in the end use assurance include the exporter, consignee, purchasers, country of final destination, description of type and quantity of items, specific purpose they will be used, an expiration date, and an undertaking that they will not be used for purposes other than those declared or re-exported without permission;
:(5) to require delivery verification to be officially certified on receipt of the shipment of conventional arms by the end user, which includes at a minimum, the name and address of the exporter and the importer, the serial number of the import certificate, a description of the goods, the quantity and value, the port of arrival and the name of the ship, aircraft or other carrier; and
