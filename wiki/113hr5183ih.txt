{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish a demonstration program requiring the utilization of Value-Based Insurance Design to demonstrate that reducing the copayments or coinsurance charged to Medicare beneficiaries for selected high-value prescription medications and clinical services can increase their utilization and ultimately improve clinical outcomes and lower health care expenditures.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “   Value Based Insurance Design for Better Care Act of 2014   ”or the“  VBID for Better Care Act of 2014  ”.  

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) A growing body of evidence demonstrates that increases in patient-level financial barriers (including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) for high-value medical services (such as prescription medications, clinician visits, diagnostic tests, and procedures) systematically reduce their use. Savings attributable to cost-related decreased utilization of specific services may lead to an increase in total medical expenditures due to increased use of other related clinical services, such as hospitalizations and emergency room visits.
:(2) Empirical research studies demonstrate that reductions in beneficiary out-of-pocket expenses for high-value prescription medications and clinical services can mitigate the adverse health and financial consequences attributable to cost-related decreased utilization of high-value services.
:(3) Financial barriers to prescription medications and clinical services that are deemed to be high-value should be reduced or eliminated to increase their use.
:(4) Value-Based Insurance Design is a methodology that adjusts patient out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications and clinical services according to the clinical value—not exclusively the cost. Value-Based Insurance Design is based on the concept of clinical nuance that recognizes—
::(A) prescription medications and clinical services differ in the clinical benefit provided; and
::(B) the clinical benefit derived from a specific prescription medication or clinical service depends on the clinical situation, the provider, and where the care is delivered.
:(5) The current“one-size-fits-all”copayment or coinsurance design for prescription medications and clinical services provided under the Medicare program does not recognize the well-established value differences in health outcomes produced by various medical interventions.
:(6) The establishment by Medicare of copayment and coinsurance requirements using Value-Based Insurance Design methodologies will improve patient-centered health outcomes, enhance personal responsibility, and afford a more efficient use of taxpayer dollars. 

=Sec. 3. Demonstration program=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]](in this section referred to as the“Secretary”) shall establish a 3-year demonstration program to test the use of value-based insurance design methodologies (as defined in subsection (c)(1) ) under eligible Medicare Advantage plans offered by Medicare Advantage organizations under  part C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395w–21 42 U.S.C. 1395w–21 et seq.] ).

==(c) Value-Based insurance design methodologies– ==



===(1) Definition– ===

For purposes of this section, the term value-based insurance design methodology means a methodology for identifying specific prescription medications, and clinical services that are reimbursable under title XVIII of the Social Security Act , for which copayments, coinsurance, or both should be reduced or eliminated because of the high-value and effectiveness of such medications and services for specific chronic clinical conditions (as approved by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]).

===(2) Use of methodologies to reduce copayments and coinsurance– ===

A Medicare Advantage organization offering an eligible Medicare Advantage plan selected to participate under the demonstration program, for each plan year for which the plan is so selected and using value-based insurance design methodologies—
:(A) shall identify each prescription medication and clinical service covered under such plan for which the amount of the copayment or coinsurance should be reduced or eliminated, with respect to the management of specific chronic clinical conditions (as specified by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]) of MA eligible individuals (as defined in  section 1851(a)(3) of the Social Security Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395w–21 42 U.S.C. 1395w–21(a)(3))] ) enrolled under such plans, for such plan year; and
:(B) may, for such plan year, reduce or eliminate copayments, coinsurance, or both for such prescription medication and clinical services so identified with respect to the management of such conditions of such individuals—
::(i) if such reduction or elimination is evidence-based, for the purpose of encouraging such individuals in such plan to use such prescription medications and clinical services (such as preventive care, primary care, specialty visits, diagnostic tests, procedures, and durable medical equipment) with respect to such conditions; and
::(ii) for the purpose of encouraging such individuals in such plan to use health care providers that such organization has identified with respect to such plan year.

===(3) Prohibition of increases of copayments and coinsurance– ===

In no case may any Medicare Advantage plan participating in the demonstration program increase, for any plan year for which the plan is so participating, the amount of copayments or coinsurance for any item or service covered under such plan for purposes of discouraging the use of such item or service.

==(d) Report on implementation– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Not later than 1 year after the date on which the demonstration program under this section begins under subsection (b)(2) , the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]a report on the status of the implementation of the demonstration program.

===(2) Elements– ===

The report required by paragraph (1) shall, with respect to eligible Medicare Advantage plans participating in the demonstration program for the first plan year of such program, include the following:
:(A) A list of each medication and service identified pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(A) for such plan with respect to such plan year.
:(B) For each such medication or service so identified, the amount of the copayment or coinsurance required under such plan with respect to such plan year for such medication or service and the amount of the reduction of such copayment or coinsurance from the previous plan year.
:(C) For each provider identified pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(B)(ii) for such plan with respect to such plan year, a statement of the amount of the copayment or coinsurance required under such plan with respect to such plan year and the amount of the reduction of such copayment or coinsurance from the previous plan year.

==(e) Review and assessment of utilization of value-Based insurance design methodologies– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall enter into a contract or agreement with an independent, non-biased entity having expertise in value-based insurance design methodologies to review and assess the implementation of the demonstration program under this section. The review and assessment shall include the following:
:(A) An assessment of the utilization of value-based insurance design methodologies by Medicare Advantage plans participating under such program.
:(B) An analysis of whether reducing or eliminating the copayment or coinsurance for each medication and clinical service identified pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(A) resulted in increased adherence to medication regimens, increased service utilization, improvement in quality metrics, better health outcomes, and enhanced beneficiary experience.
:(C) An analysis of the extent to which costs to Medicare Advantage plans under part C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act participating in the demonstration program is less than costs to Medicare Advantage plans under such part that are not participating in the demonstration program.
