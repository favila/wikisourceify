{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate that the United States should leave no member of the Armed Forces unaccounted for during the drawdown of forces in Afghanistan.    Whereas the United States is a country of great honor and integrity;   Whereas the United States has made a sacred promise to members of the Armed Forces who are deployed overseas in defense of this country that their sacrifice and service will never be forgotten; and   Whereas the United States can never thank the proud members of the Armed Forces enough for what they do for this country on a daily basis: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]—
:(1) believes that the United States should undertake every reasonable effort—
::(A) to find and repatriate members of the Armed Forces who are missing; and
::(B) to repatriate members of the Armed Forces who are captured;
:(2) believes that the United States has a responsibility to keep the promises made to members of the Armed Forces who risk their lives on a daily basis on behalf of the people of the United States;
:(3) supports the United States Soldier’s Creed and the Warrior Ethos, which state that“I will never leave a fallen comrade”; and
:(4) believes that, while the United States continues to transition leadership roles in combat operations in Afghanistan to the people of Afghanistan, the United States must continue to fulfill these important promises to any member of the Armed Forces who is in a missing status or captured as a result of service in Afghanistan now or in the future.
