===(37) Fundamentally undervalued currency– ===

The administering authority shall determine that the currency of a country in which the subject merchandise is produced is a “fundamentally undervalued currency” if—

:(B) the real effective exchange rate of the currency is undervalued by at least 5 percent, on average and as calculated under paragraph (38), relative to the equilibrium real effective exchange rate for the country’s currency during the 18-month period;
:(C) during the 18-month period, the country has experienced significant and persistent global current account surpluses; and
:(D) during the 18-month period, the foreign asset reserves held by the government of the country exceed—

===(38) Real effective exchange rate undervaluation– ===

The calculation of real effective exchange rate undervaluation, for purposes of paragraph (5)(E)(v)and paragraph (37), shall—

::(i) rely upon, and where appropriate be the simple average of, the results yielded from application of the approaches described in the guidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues; or
::(ii) if the guidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues are not available, be based on generally accepted economic and econometric techniques and methodologies to measure the level of undervaluation;
:(B) rely upon data that are publicly available, reliable, and compiled and maintained by the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]] or, if the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]] cannot provide the data, by other international organizations or by national governments; and
:(C) use inflation-adjusted, trade-weighted exchange rates..
