{{Center|A BILL}}

 To increase the understanding of the health effects of low doses of ionizing radiation.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Low-Dose Radiation Research Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Low dose radiation research program=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:Office of Science|Director of the Department of Energy Office of Science]]shall carry out a research program on low dose radiation. The purpose of the program is to enhance the scientific understanding of and reduce uncertainties associated with the effects of exposure to low dose radiation in order to inform improved risk management methods.

==(b) Study– ==

Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director shall enter into an agreement with the National Academies to conduct a study assessing the current status and development of a long-term strategy for low dose radiation research. Such study shall be completed not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act. The study shall be conducted in coordination with Federal agencies that perform ionizing radiation effects research and shall leverage the most current studies in this field. Such study shall—
:(1) identify current scientific challenges for understanding the long-term effects of ionizing radiation;
:(2) assess the status of current low dose radiation research in the United States and internationally;
:(3) formulate overall scientific goals for the future of low-dose radiation research in the United States;
:(4) recommend a long-term strategic and prioritized research agenda to address scientific research goals for overcoming the identified scientific challenges in coordination with other research efforts;
:(5) define the essential components of a research program that would address this research agenda within the universities and the National Laboratories; and
:(6) assess the cost-benefit effectiveness of such a program.

==(c) Research plan– ==

Not later than 90 days after the completion of the study performed under subsection (b) the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]]shall deliver to the [[w:United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives]]and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate]]a 5-year research plan that responds to the study’s findings and recommendations and identifies and prioritizes research needs.

==(d) Definition– ==

In this section, the term“low dose radiation”means a radiation dose of less than 100 millisieverts.

==(e) Prohibition on biomedical research– ==

   Section 977(e) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/16317 42 U.S.C. 16317(e)] )is amended to read as follows:

<blockquote> 

===(e) Prohibition on biomedical research– ===

In carrying out the program under this section, the Secretary shall not conduct biomedical research. . 
</blockquote>


==(f) Funding– ==

No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated under this section. This Act shall be carried out using funds otherwise appropriated by law.
