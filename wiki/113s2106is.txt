=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Freeing Americans from Inequitable Requirements Act of 2014   ”or the“ FAIR Act of 2014 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings; purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (hereafter referred to as“PPACA”), the Administration—through the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]and the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]—has unilaterally delayed or changed PPACA at least eighteen times.
:(2) On July 2, 2013, the Administration delayed until 2015 the PPACA requirement that employers with at least 50 full-time equivalent employees provide health coverage for their full-time workers or risk paying a penalty to the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]].
:(3) On February 10, 2014, the Administration once again delayed the PPACA requirement until 2016 for employers with between 50 and 99 full-time equivalent employees to provide qualified health insurance to their employees.
:(4) The Administration lacks the authority to unilaterally change statutorily defined dates in order to delay the implementation of any provision of PPACA .
:(5) If the Administration continues to suspend the penalties for businesses absent any statutory authority, then the penalties for all Americans should be suspended on the basis of fundamental fairness.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to require the suspension of the enforcement of penalties associated with the individual mandate should the Administration unilaterally announce a suspension of the enforcement of penalties for any component of the employer mandate. 

=Sec. 3. Individual health insurance mandate delayed until employer health insurance mandate enforced without exceptions=
