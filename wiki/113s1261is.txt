=====(C) Administration– =====

The performance goals established under this paragraph shall—
:(i) measure information technology costs over a specific time period of 3 to 5 years;
:(ii) measure cost savings attained via the use of energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications solutions during the same time period; and
:(iii) provide, to the maximum extent practicable, a complete picture of all costs and savings, including energy costs and savings.

====(5) Federal data centers task force– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

The [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]]shall maintain a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers.

=====(B) Duties– =====

The members of the task force shall—
:(i) be responsible for working together to share progress toward individual agency goals and the overall Federal target for increased energy efficiency; and
:(ii) regularly exchange best practices and other strategic information related to energy efficiency with the private sector.

====(6) Reports– ====



=====(A) Agency reports– =====

Each Federal agency subject to the requirements of this subsection shall include in the report of the agency under  section 527 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17143 42 U.S.C. 17143])a description of the efforts and results of the agency under this subsection.

=====(B) OMB Government efficiency reports and scorecards– =====

Effective beginning not later than October 1, 2013, the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]]shall include in the annual report and scorecard of the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director]]required under  section 528 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17144 42 U.S.C. 17144])a description of the efforts and results of Federal agencies under this subsection. .
