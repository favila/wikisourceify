{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide access to medication-assisted therapy, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “   Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act   ”or the“  TREAT Act  ” . 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) Overdoses from opioids have increased dramatically in the United States.
:(2) Deaths from drug overdose, largely from prescription pain relievers, have tripled among men and increased five-fold among women over the past decade.
:(3) Nationwide, drug overdoses now claim more lives than car accidents.
:(4) Opioid addiction is a chronic disease that, untreated, places a large burden on the healthcare system. Roughly 475,000 emergency room visits each year are attributable to the misuse and abuse of opioid pain medication.
:(5) Effective medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction can decrease overdose deaths, be cost-effective, reduce transmissions of HIV and viral hepatitis, and reduce other social harms such as criminal activity.
:(6) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for opioid addiction should include multiple components, including medications, cognitive and behavioral supports and interventions, and drug testing.
:(7) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for opioid addiction may use a team of staff members, in addition to a prescribing provider, to deliver comprehensive care.
:(8) Access to medication-assisted treatments, including office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment, remains limited in part due to current practice regulations and an insufficient number of providers.
:(9) More than 10 years of experience in the United States with office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment has informed best practices for delivering successful, high quality care.
