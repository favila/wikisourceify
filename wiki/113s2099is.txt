{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 5, United States Code, to establish uniform requirements for thorough economic analysis of regulations by Federal agencies based on sound principles, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Sound Regulation Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Growing Federal regulation that is highly prescriptive in nature burdens and impairs the international competitiveness of industry in the United States.
:(2) Prescriptive regulation takes away flexibility, is adversarial in nature, leads to unintended consequences, and, especially as it proliferates, slows economic growth and job creation.
:(3) Despite evidence of increasing regulatory costs, Federal agencies hold fast to the presumption that their rules are in the public interest.
:(4) Some statutes prohibit agencies from considering costs and benefits in rulemaking, although no statutes prohibit agencies from analyzing the costs and benefits of rules for informative purposes.
:(5) 
::(A) Cost-benefit analysis is not institutionalized for independent regulatory agencies.
::(B) Executive agencies perform cost-benefit analysis pursuant to Executive order and under the purview of the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]](commonly referred to as“OIRA”), which takes direction from the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]].
::(C) Peer review is not required for cost-benefit analysis by independent regulatory agencies or executive agencies.
:(6) There are no—
::(A) statutory standards for cost-benefit analysis in Federal rulemaking; or
::(B) consistent, material consequences when rules are based on faulty or inadequate analysis.
:(7) Agencies—
::(A) conduct their own regulatory impact analysis—
:::(i) largely by methods of their own choosing; and
:::(ii) only on a small fraction of the rules they issue; and
::(B) use regulatory cost-benefit analysis mainly in support of favored, preconceived rules rather than as a decision tool.
:(8) Common deficiencies in the regulatory analysis used by agencies include—
::(A) lack of a coherent theory by which to—
:::(i) define a problem;
:::(ii) determine why the problem occurs; and
:::(iii) guide the agency to the most efficient response;
::(B) lack of objective evidence that an actionable problem actually exists, what its dimensions are, and how they differ from acceptable norms;
::(C) lack of comprehensive analysis to—
:::(i) determine whether a market malfunction exists; and
:::(ii) orient rulemaking to the causes, not the symptoms, of the market malfunction;
::(D) failure to set clear and realistic objectives whose benefits justify the cost of achieving the objectives;
::(E) objectives that—
:::(i) are disconnected from costs; and
:::(ii) may be expansive and vague so that any regulation can be made to appear beneficial;
::(F) agencies increasingly claiming—
:::(i) incidental benefits (also known as“co-benefits”) that are not in furtherance of the stated objective; and
:::(ii) even private, as opposed to public, benefits for rules;
::(G) failure to—
:::(i) develop regulatory options in light of market analysis; and
:::(ii) rank regulatory options by how efficiently they will improve the market process;
::(H) inconsistent assumptions and methodologies across agencies;
::(I) invalid baselines for gauging regulatory effects;
::(J) the omission of important impacts, such as the impact on employment and on the international competitiveness of United States firms;
::(K) failure to reevaluate regulations after implementation; and
::(L) failure to consider the cumulative costs of regulation by the various Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies.
:(9) 
::(A) Despite continually changing market conditions, agencies do not—
:::(i) regularly review their existing regulations and regulatory regimes; or
:::(ii) review the division of functions—
::::(I) among different Federal agencies; or
::::(II) among Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies.
::(B) Regulations lose their purpose, yet linger and accumulate, imposing unnecessary costs and slowing economic growth to the detriment of—
:::(i) material living standards; and
:::(ii) to some extent, the very social conditions that are the objects of regulation.
:(10) 
::(A) Agencies typically do not—
:::(i) proactively conduct regulatory cost studies; and
:::(ii) report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]on unnecessary costs that are not under the control of the agencies because of the way laws are written.
::(B) Agency recommendations on how to improve the efficiency of regulation by modifying an existing statute could be helpful to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]. 

=Sec. 3. Uniform use of cost-benefit analysis=

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553  Section 553of title 5, United States Code], is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 
:(f) 
::(1) Before an agency publishes or otherwise provides notice of a notice of proposed rulemaking under this section, the agency shall comply with the following requirements with respect to the proposed rule:
:::(A) The agency shall identify, in the context of a coherent conceptual framework and supported with objective data—
::::(i) the nature and significance of the market failure, regulatory failure, or other problem that necessitates regulatory action;
::::(ii) the reasons why national economic and income growth, advancing technology, and other market developments will not obviate the need for the rulemaking;
::::(iii) the reasons why regulation at the State, local, or tribal level could not address the problem better than at the Federal level;
::::(iv) the reasons why reducing rather than increasing the extent or stringency of existing Federal regulation would not address the problem better; and
::::(v) the particular authority under which the agency may take action.
:::(B) Before the agency increases the extent or stringency of regulation based on its determinations pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (A)], the agency shall—
::::(i) set an achievable objective for its regulatory action and identify the metrics by which the agency will measure progress toward the objective;
::::(ii) issue a notice of inquiry seeking public comment on the identification of a new objective under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (i)]; and
::::(iii) give notice to the committees of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]with jurisdiction over the subject matter of the rule.
:::(C) If the agency is not seeking to repeal a rule, the agency shall develop not less than 3 distinct regulatory options, in addition to not regulating, that the agency estimates will provide the greatest benefits for the least cost in meeting the regulatory objective set under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (B)]and, in developing such regulatory options, shall apply the following principles:
::::(i) The agency shall, to the extent practicable—
:::::(I) attempt to engage private incentives to solve a problem; and
:::::(II) not supplant private incentives any more than necessary.
::::(ii) The agency shall consider the adverse effects that mandates and prohibitions may have on innovation, economic growth, and employment.
::::(iii) 
:::::(I) The agency’s risk assessment shall be confined to the jurisdiction of the agency, subject to specific regulatory authority.
:::::(II) Agency assessments of the risks of adverse health and environmental effects shall follow standardized parameters, assumptions, and methodologies.
:::::(III) The agency shall provide analyses of increases in risks, whatever their nature, produced by the regulatory options under consideration.
::::(iv) The agency shall avoid incongruities and duplication in regulation at the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels.
::::(v) The agency shall compare and contrast the regulatory options developed and explain how each would meet the regulatory objective set pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (B)].
:::(D) The agency shall estimate the costs and benefits of each regulatory option developed, notwithstanding any provision of law that prohibits the agency from using costs in rulemaking, at least to the extent that the agency is able to—
::::(i) exclude options whose costs exceed their benefits;
::::(ii) rank the options by cost from lowest to highest;
::::(iii) estimate the monetary cost of any adverse effects on private property rights, identify the categories of persons who experience a net loss from a regulatory option, and explain why the negative effects cannot be lessened or avoided;
::::(iv) establish whether the cost of an option exceeds $50,000,000 for any 12-month period, except that the dollar amount shall be adjusted annually for inflation based on the GDP deflator, and the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]may order that a lower dollar amount be used for a particular period;
::::(v) identify the key uncertainties and assumptions that drive the results of the analysis under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (iv)]; and
::::(vi) provide an analysis of how the ranking of the options and the threshold determination under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (iv)]may change if key assumptions are changed.
:::(E) The estimates pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraph (D)]shall—
::::(i) follow the methodology established pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (2)(A)];
::::(ii) to the maximum extent practicable, comply with any guidelines issued by the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]]pertaining to cost-benefit analysis; and
::::(iii) include, at a minimum—
:::::(I) agency administrative costs;
:::::(II) United States private sector compliance costs;
:::::(III) Federal, State, local, and tribal compliance costs;
:::::(IV) Federal, State, local, and tribal revenue impacts;
:::::(V) impacts from the regulatory options developed on United States industries in the role of suppliers and consumers to each industry substantially affected, especially in terms of employment, costs, volume and quality of output, and prices;
:::::(VI) nationwide impacts on overall economic output, productivity, and consumer and producer prices;
:::::(VII) international competitiveness of United States companies; and
:::::(VIII) distortions in incentives and markets, including an estimate of the resulting loss to the United States economy.
:::(F) The agency shall—
::::(i) publish for public comment all analyses, documentation, and data under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 subparagraphs (A) through (D)]for a public comment period of not less than 30 days (subject to applicable limitations under law, including laws protecting privacy, trade secrets, and intellectual property); and
::::(ii) correct deficiencies or omissions that the agency becomes aware of before choosing a rule to propose.
::(2) 
:::(A) 
::::(i) Beginning not later than the date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of the  Sound Regulation Act of 2014  , each agency shall, by rule—
:::::(I) establish and maintain a specific cost-benefit analysis methodology appropriate to the functions and responsibilities of the agency; and
:::::(II) establish an appropriate period for review of new rules to assess the cost effectiveness of each such new rule at achieving the objective that the new rule was intended to address, as identified under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (1)(B)(i)].
::::(ii) The methodology established by an agency under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (i)]shall—
:::::(I) include the standardized parameters, assumptions, and methodologies for agency assessments of risk under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (1)(C)(iii)];
:::::(II) comply, to the maximum extent practicable, with technical standards for methodologies and assumptions issued by the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]];
:::::(III) include the scope of benefits and costs consistent with the framework used and the metrics identified in the establishment of the regulatory objective under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (1)];
:::::(IV) not include consideration of incidental benefits but only those benefits that were considered in the establishment of the regulatory objective under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (1)];
:::::(V) limit consideration of costs and benefits to costs and benefits that accrue to the population of the United States;
:::::(VI) constrain the agency from presuming that continued augmentation or tightening of mandates and additional prohibitions cause benefits and costs to change linearly but instead determine at what point benefits will rise less than, and costs will rise more than, proportionally;
:::::(VII) include comparison of incremental benefits to incremental costs from any action the agency considers taking and refrain from actions whose incremental benefits do not exceed their incremental costs; and
:::::(VIII) include analysis of effects on private incentives and possible unintended consequences.
::::(iii) Each agency shall adhere to the methodology established by the agency under this subparagraph in all rulemakings.
:::(B) If an agency does not select the least-cost regulatory option as its proposed rule, the agency shall justify its selection, explaining—
::::(i) how that selection furthers other goals or requirements relevant to regulating matters within the jurisdiction of the agency and why these should override cost savings; and
::::(ii) why each of the other regulatory options not chosen would not sufficiently further such other goals or requirements.
:::(C) Any person may petition an agency to amend an existing rule made prior to the establishment of methodology under this paragraph, and, if the agency denies such a petition, that denial shall be subject to review underchapter 7of this title.
::(3) If an agency makes a determination under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 paragraph (1)(D)]that the monetized cost of a rule exceeds the applicable monetary limit under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/553 clause (iv)]of such paragraph for any 12-month period—
:::(A) the head of the agency shall—
