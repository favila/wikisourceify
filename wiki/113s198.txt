=={{anchor|H70D2D41017F346D5977E20AB2F402FE8}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On August 26, 2011, a vehicle borne explosive device (VBIED) was detonated after being driven into the lobby of a United Nations facility in Abuja, Nigeria. At least 21 people died as a result of the explosion, and the Islamist militant organization commonly called Boko Haram claimed responsibility.
:(2) On December 25, 2011, a series of bombs were detonated across northern Nigeria. Some of these attacks killed worshippers attending Christmas Day services, and killed an estimated total of 41 people. Boko Haram claimed responsibility.
:(3) From their inception, Boko Haram has killed hundreds of innocent civilians and has continually enhanced its lethality, pledging to continue its use of terrorist tactics. In a July 2010 statement, Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, issued support to al Qaeda and made threatening remarks to the United States.
:(4) On January 31, 2012, in testimony before Congress, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper included Boko Haram in his worldwide threat assessment, stating,“There are also fears that Boko Haram—elements of which have engaged al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)—is interested in hitting Western targets, such as the U.S. Embassy and hotels frequented by Westerners.”.
:(5) On February 23, 2012, United States Ambassador to Nigeria Terrence P. McCulley indicated Boko Haram’s danger was expanding. He said,“We’ve seen an increase in sophistication, we’ve seen increased lethality. We saw at last a part of the group has decided it’s in their interest to attack the international community.”.
:(6) On February 27, 2012, at a conference held by the African Society of the National Summit on Africa, former United States Ambassador to Nigeria Howard F. Jeter described Boko Haram by saying,“It is a terrorist group. If you kill 28 innocent people worshipping in a church, it is a terrorist group.”.
:(7) The Foreign Office of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a major United States ally, publicly refers to Boko Haram as the“main terrorist threat in Nigeria”.
