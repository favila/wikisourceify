{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the United States Postal Service honoring the 1915 Panama-California Exposition, and that the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.    Whereas San Diego played host to the Panama-California Exposition from January 1, 1915, until January 1, 1917;   Whereas the Panama-California Exposition recognized the historic completion of the Panama Canal, which revolutionized transcontinental trade;   Whereas, on May 22, 1911, the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]passed a congressional resolution endorsing San Diego’s Panama-California Exposition and called on President William Howard Taft to invite our Central and South American partner nations as exposition participants;   Whereas seven States—California, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Washington, Montana, and Kansas—participated in that exposition and highlighted the unrealized potential of the American West;   Whereas San Diego has realized that potential over the past 100 years, growing to become the second largest city in California, the eighth largest city in our Nation, and a world leader in biomedical and technology research that was unimaginable a hundred years ago;   Whereas architects John and Frederick Olmsted of Massachusetts, Frank P. Allen, Jr., of Washington State, and Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue of New York collaborated to transform a little-used public park into a forward-looking urban landmark to host the exposition;   Whereas that park, known as Balboa Park, has since continued to host internationally recognized artistic performances, educational exhibits, and, during both World Wars, served as an active military installation;   Whereas the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]recognized this rich history when it designated Balboa Park as a National Historic Landmark in 1977; and   Whereas Balboa Park will celebrate its centennial beginning in 2015 with a year of festivities that showcase San Diego’s intellectual capital, imaginative spirit, and exceptional quality of life: Now, therefore, be it
