{{Center|A BILL}}

 To require the Secretary of Commerce to establish the Network for Manufacturing Innovation and for other purposes.    

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) In 2012, manufacturers contributed $2.03 trillion to the economy, or1/8of United States Gross Domestic Product.
:(2) For every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, another $1.32 is added to the economy, the highest multiplier effect of any economic sector.
:(3) Manufacturing supports an estimated 17,400,000 jobs in the United States—about 1 in 6 private-sector jobs. More than 12,000,000 Americans (or 9 percent of the workforce) are employed directly in manufacturing.
:(4) In 2012, the average manufacturing worker in the United States earned $77,505 annually, including pay and benefits. The average worker in all industries earned $62,063.
:(5) Taken alone, manufacturing in the United States would be the 8th largest economy in the world.
:(6) Manufacturers in the United States perform two-thirds of all private-sector research and development in the United States, driving more innovation than any other sector. 

=Sec. 3. Establishment of network for manufacturing innovation=


: The  National Institute of Standards and Technology Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/271 15 U.S.C. 271 et seq.] )is amended—
::(1) by redesignating section 34 as section 35 ; and
