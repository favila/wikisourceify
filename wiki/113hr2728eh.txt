==Title I— State Authority For Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation==



==Sec. 101. Short title==

This title may be cited as the“ Protecting States’ Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act ”.

==Sec. 102. State authority for hydraulic fracturing regulation==

The  Mineral Leasing Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/30/181 30 U.S.C. 181 et seq].)is amended by redesignating section 44 as section 45 , and by inserting after section 43 the following:

===(b) State authority– ===

The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] shall recognize and defer to State regulations, permitting, and guidance, for all activities related to hydraulic fracturing, or any component of that process, relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on Federal land.

===(e) Hydraulic fracturing defined– ===

In this section the term hydraulic fracturing means the process by which fracturing fluids (or a fracturing fluid system) are pumped into an underground geologic formation at a calculated, predetermined rate and pressure to generate fractures or cracks in the target formation and thereby increase the permeability of the rock near the wellbore and improve production of natural gas or oil. .

==Sec. 103. Government Accountability Office study==



===(a) Study– ===

The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General of the United States]] shall conduct a study examining the economic benefits of domestic shale oil and gas production resulting from the process of hydraulic fracturing. This study will include identification of—
:(1) State and Federal revenue generated as a result of shale gas production;
:(2) jobs created both directly and indirectly as a result of shale oil and gas production; and
:(3) an estimate of potential energy prices without domestic shale oil and gas production.

===(b) Report– ===

The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] shall submit a report on the findings of such study to the [[w:United States House Committee on Natural Resources|Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives]] within 30 days after completion of the study.
