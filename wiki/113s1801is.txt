=Sec. 2. Findings; sense of Congress=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Working families in the United States and around the world have not enjoyed many of the benefits of increased global trade.
:(2) While the global economy grew at an average rate of 3.3 percent per year between 1995 and 2007, annual wage growth remained at less than 3 percent.
:(3) Between 1989 and 2010, hourly productivity in the United States grew more than 3 times as fast as wages, and nearly 4,000,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared in the United States between 1998 and 2013.
:(4) The lowest 20 percent of wage earners in the United States have seen average hourly wages decline by 3.9 percent, and the next lowest 20 percent saw their earnings fall by 4.3 percent, while earnings for those in the top 20 percent increased by nearly 30 percent.
:(5) In 2010, there were approximately 942,000,000 working poor living with their families on less than $2.00 per person per day.
:(6) Global biodiversity health declined 28 percent from 1970 to 2008.
:(7) The World Health Organization attributes more than 500,000 premature deaths annually to urban air pollution in Asia alone.
:(8) An estimated 160,000,000 people suffer from work-related diseases, and there are an estimated 270,000,000 fatal and non-fatal work-related accidents each year.

==(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) the antidumping and countervailing duty laws of the United States under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1671 19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq] .)have provided targeted, effective relief against unfair trade practices and must be protected and enhanced; and
:(2) the failure to include within antidumping duty calculations the real costs of inadequate wages, insufficient workplace safety conditions, and insufficient environmental controls—
::(A) has a substantial negative effect on United States manufacturing and the United States economy; and
::(B) fails to support efforts to improve conditions for working families and the environment in the United States and around the world.

=Sec. 3. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to ensure that goods imported into the United States fully reflect the real costs of paying an adequate living wage, upholding workplace safety standards, and maintaining basic environmental protections; and
:(2) to provide a streamlined method for entities that meet those standards to satisfy the requirements of the amendments made by this Act.

=Sec. 4. Adjustment of normal value to include the cost of paying adequate wages and maintaining sustainable production methods=
