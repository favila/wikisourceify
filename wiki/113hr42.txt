			 sense of congress=



=={{anchor|H4251BE08839A475C9809A6DF70A6D79A}}(a) Findings– ==

[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]]
			 finds the following:
:(1) America’s warriors offer a life of supreme
			 devotion in service to their Nation, and through generations of war-fighting,
			 their dedication has proven honorable, their sacrifice immeasurable, and their
			 record of excellence undeniable.
:(2) No American goes to war alone—the burden of
			 every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine is shared, in part, by all of his or
			 her loved ones.

=={{anchor|H969051D876494B88A2707D1F45B00A54}}(b) Sense of
			 Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) so long as the United States sends men and
			 women into battle, the United States will be faithful to care for them upon
			 their return;
:(2) as the veteran answered the call of duty,
			 so too, is the United States duty-bound to answer the call of the
			 veteran;
:(3) the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the
			 [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] have the tools and ingenuity to provide
			 continued excellent health care without increasing TRICARE payments from the
			 veteran before fiscal year 2014; and
:(4) in the words of President Abraham Lincoln,
			 “let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's
			 wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and
			 his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
			 among ourselves and with all nations.”.
