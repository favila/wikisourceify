:(A) for adjustable rate wood heaters or pellet heaters/stoves that were, on or before the effective date of the rule, certified as being in compliance with any applicable standard of performance for particulate matter, that is less than 4.5 grams of particulate matter per hour;
:(B) for all other adjustable rate wood heaters, single burn rate wood heaters, or pellet heaters/stoves, that is less than 4.5 grams of particulate matter per hour;
:(C) for any residential hydronic heater, that is less than 0.32 pound per million British thermal unit heat output as measured under ASTM E2618–13“Standard Test Method for Measurement of Particulate Emissions and Heating Efficiency of Solid Fuel-Fired Hydronic Heating Appliances”using either cordwood or cribs; or
:(D) for any forced-air furnace, that is less than 0.93 pound per million British thermal unit heat output.

===(2) Transition period– ===

During the period specified in subsection (c) , in finalizing or issuing any rule described in subsection (b) , the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall—
:(A) with respect to a residential wood heater that was certified on or before the effective date of the rule by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]as in compliance with any applicable emissions limit in effect prior to the date of enactment of this Act—
::(i) provide that such certification shall remain valid until the date that is five years after such heater was certified; and
::(ii) permit any such heater to be manufactured and sold at retail until the date that is five years after such heater was certified;
:(B) with respect to a forced-air furnace—
::(i) except as provided in clause (ii) —
:::(I) that is manufactured on or before the effective date of such rule, permit such forced-air furnace to be sold at retail for a period of at least one year after such effective date; or
:::(II) that is manufactured after the effective date of such rule, not require such forced-air furnace to meet any applicable particulate matter emissions limit set forth in such rule until the date that is at least one year after such effective date; or
::(ii) that was tested under Canadian Standards Administration B415.1–10 test protocol on or before the effective date of the rule and met a particulate matter emissions limit of 0.93 pound per million British thermal unit heat output, permit such forced-air furnace to be manufactured and sold at retail for a period of five years after such effective date; and
:(C) with respect to a hydronic heater that—
::(i) is a qualified model, deem such hydronic heater to be certified as in compliance with any otherwise applicable emissions limit under such rule for the duration of the period it would be considered a qualified model, but in no case for a period of less than 3 years beginning on the effective date of such rule; or
