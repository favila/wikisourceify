        {{Center|RESOLUTION}}
    
		Recognizing National Emancipation Day,
		  marking the 150th anniversary of the end of slavery in areas of rebellion, and
		  the significance of the Emancipation Proclamation in the struggle for the equal
		  rights and freedoms afforded to all United States citizens.
	
	
		
      Whereas in 1619, a ship flying the Dutch flag stopped at
			 Old Point Comfort in the Virginia Colony with 20 Africans onboard;
		
    
      Whereas the arrival of these 20 Africans to the Virginia
			 Peninsula marked the beginning of more than 200 years of captivity for Africans
			 in the United States;
		
    
      Whereas President Abraham Lincoln, during the American
			 Civil War and in accordance with the war powers vested to him issued a
			 proclamation on September 22, 1862, declaring that on the first day of January,
			 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of
			 a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United
			 States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free;
		
    
      Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation, as an Executive
			 order, legally emancipated millions of slaves in the States of South Carolina,
			 Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas,
			 and North Carolina;
		
    
      Whereas for two-and-a-half years after the Emancipation
			 Proclamation became official, Texas slaves were held in bondage and only after
			 June 19, 1865, when Union Soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, were
			 African-American slaves in that State set free;
		
    
      Whereas, on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to
			 the United States Constitution, which reads Neither slavery nor
			 involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall
			 have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place
			 subject to their jurisdiction, was adopted and effectively outlawed
			 slavery in the United States;
		
    
      Whereas the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation was
			 a significant precursor to the adoption of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and
			 Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, also known as the
			 Reconstruction Amendments, adopted between 1865 and 1870, as well as the Civil
			 Rights Act of 1964, the National Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair
			 Housing Act of 1968 among others; and
		
    
      Whereas slaves and their descendants in the United States
			 have contributed significantly to the foundation, growth, diversity, and
			 leadership of the United States: Now, therefore, be it

      That the
