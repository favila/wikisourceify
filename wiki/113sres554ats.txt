{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the month of October 2014 as“National Principals Month”.    Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National Association of Elementary School Principals have declared the month of October 2014 to be“National Principals Month”;   Whereas principals are educational visionaries, instructional and assessment leaders, disciplinarians, community builders, budget analysts, facilities managers, and administrators of legal and contractual obligations;   Whereas principals work collaboratively with teachers and parents to develop and implement a clear mission, high curriculum standards, and performance goals;   Whereas principals create school environments that facilitate great teaching and learning and continuous school improvement;   Whereas the vision, actions, and dedication of principals provide the mobilizing force behind any school reform effort; and   Whereas the celebration of National Principals Month would honor elementary school, middle school, and high school principals, and recognize the importance of principals in ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education: Now, therefore, be it

:(1) recognizes the month of October 2014 as“National Principals Month”; and
