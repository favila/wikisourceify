{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for an equitable management of summer flounder based on geographic, scientific, and economic data and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Fluke Fairness Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Summer flounder is an important economic fish stock for commercial and recreational fishermen across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States.
:(2) The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1801 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq] .)was reauthorized in 2006 and instituted annual catch limits and accountability measures for important fish stocks.
:(3) That reauthorization prompted fishery managers to look at alternate management schemes to rebuild depleted stocks like summer flounder.
:(4) Summer flounder occur in both State and Federal waters and are managed through a joint fishery management plan between the [[w:|Council]] and the [[w:|Commission]] .
:(5) The [[w:|Council]] and the [[w:|Commission]] decided that each State’s recreational and commercial harvest limits for summer flounder would be based upon landings in previous years.
:(6) These historical landings were based on flawed data sets that no longer provide fairness or flexibility for fisheries managers to allocate resources based on the best science.
:(7) This allocation mechanism resulted in an uneven split among the States along the East Coast which is problematic.
:(8) The Fishery Management Plan for summer flounder does not account for regional changes in the location of the fluke stock even though the stock has moved further to the north and changes in effort by anglers along the East Coast.
:(9) The States have been locked in a management system based on data that occurred over a decade ago and the summer flounder stock is not being managed using the best available science and modern fishery management techniques.
:(10) It is in the interest of the Federal Government to establish a new fishery management plan for summer flounder that is based on current geographic, scientific, and economic realities.

==(3) National Standards– ==

:(1) shall be based on the best scientific information available;
:(2) reflects changes in the distribution, abundance, and location of summer flounder in establishing distribution of the commercial and recreational catch quotas;
:(3) considers regional, coastwide, or other management measures for summer flounder that comply with the National Standards; and
:(4) prohibits the allocation of commercial or recreational catch quotas for summer flounder on a State-by-State basis using historical landings data that does not reflect the status of the summer flounder stock, based on the most recent scientific information.

==(b) Consultation with the Commission– ==

In preparing the modified fishery management plan or an amendment to such a plan as described in subsection (a), the [[w:|Council]] shall consult with the [[w:|Commission]] to ensure consistent management throughout the range of the summer flounder.

==(c) Failure To submit plan– ==

If the [[w:|Council]] fails to submit a modified fishery management plan or an amendment to such a plan as described in subsection (a)that may be approved by the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]] , the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]] shall prepare and approve such a modified plan or amendment.
