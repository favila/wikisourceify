={{anchor|HAD0F217CDE664D34AD4902B20BDCB4ED}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) According to the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Energy Information Administration]] , the transportation sector accounts for approximately 28 percent of the United States primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, and 24 percent of global oil demand.
:(2) The United States transportation sector is over 95 percent dependent on petroleum, and over 60 percent of petroleum demand is met by imported supplies.
:(3) United States heavy truck fuel consumption will increase 21 percent by 2030, while overall transportation energy use will decline by 2 percent.
:(4) The domestic automotive and commercial vehicle manufacturing sectors have increasingly limited resources for research, development, and engineering of advanced technologies.
:(5) Vehicle, engine, and component manufacturers are playing a more important role in vehicle technology development, and should be better integrated into Federal research efforts.
:(6) Priorities for the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy’s]] vehicle technologies research have shifted drastically in recent years among diesel hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and plug-in electric hybrids, with little continuity among them.
:(7) The integration of vehicle, communication, and infrastructure technologies has great potential for efficiency gains through better management of the total transportation system.
:(8) The Federal Government should balance its role in researching longer-term exploratory concepts and developing nearer-term transformational technologies for vehicles.
