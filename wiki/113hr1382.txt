To authorize the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to establish a constituent-driven program that collects priority coastal geospatial data and supports an information platform capable of efficiently integrating coastal data with decision support tools, training, and best practices to inform and improve local, State, regional, and Federal capacities to manage the coastal region.

This Act may be cited as the“Digital Coast Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|HCB130A5815F14C7FAD00524A0DA77CDE}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the lack of current, accurate, uniform, and standards-based geospatial information to characterize the United States coastal region presents a significant liability to adequately manage and maintain the Nation’s—
::(A) environment;
::(B) infrastructure;
::(C) economy; and
::(D) public safety and homeland security;
:(2) more than half of all people of the United States (153 million) currently live on or near a coast and an additional 12 million are expected in the next decade;
:(3) coastal counties in the United States average 300 persons per square mile, compared with the national average of 98;
:(4) on a typical day, more than 1,540 permits for construction of single-family homes are issued in coastal counties, combined with other commercial, retail, and institutional construction to support this population;
:(5) over half of the Nation’s economic productivity is located within coastal regions;
:(6) highly accurate, high-resolution remote sensing and other geospatial data play an important role in management of the coastal zone and economy, including for flood and coastal storm surge prediction; hazard risk and vulnerability assessment; emergency response and recovery planning; community resilience to longer range climate change impacts; permitting and zoning decisionmaking; habitat and ecosystem health assessments; and landscape change detection; and
:(7) the Digital Coast is a model approach in effective Federal partnerships with local and State government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.

={{anchor|H898AD3B7486041199763BFC15A00EAA4}}Sec. 3. Definitions=

In this Act:
:(1) The term Digital Coast means a constituent-driven effort led by the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Secretary]] to provide an enabling platform that integrates geospatial data, decision support tools, training, and best practices to address coastal and emergency management issues and needs. The Digital Coast strives to sustain and enhance coastal economies and ecosystem services by helping communities address their issues, needs, and challenges through cost-effective and participatory solutions.
:(2) The term remote sensing and other geospatial means collecting, storing, retrieving, or disseminating graphical or digital data depicting natural or manmade physical features, phenomena, or boundaries of the Earth and any information related thereto, including surveys, maps, charts, satellite and airborne remote sensing data, images, lidar, and services performed by professionals such as surveyors, photogrammetrists, hydrographers, geodesists, cartographers, and other such services.
:(3) The term Secretary means the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
:(4) The term State —
::(A) means a State of the United States in, or bordering on, the Atlantic, Pacific, or Arctic Ocean, the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, Long Island Sound, or one or more of the Great Lakes; and
::(B) includes Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands, American Samoa, and any portion of a State that is located within 100 kilometers of the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, the Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, or the Great Lakes.
:(5) The term coastal region means the area of United States waters extending inland from the shoreline to include coastal watersheds and seaward to the territorial sea.
:(6) The term Federal Geographic Data Committee means the interagency committee that promotes the coordinated development, use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data on a national basis.
