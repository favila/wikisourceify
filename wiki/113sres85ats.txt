{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating April 2013 as“National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month”.    Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs when the diaphragm fails to fully form, allowing abdominal organs to migrate into the chest cavity and prevent lung growth;   Whereas the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] defines congenital diaphragmatic hernia as a birth defect;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs in 1 of every 2,500 births;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia affects approximately 1,600 babies each year in the United States;   Whereas the majority of congenital diaphragmatic hernia patients have underdeveloped lungs or poor pulmonary function;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia patients often endure long-term complications, including pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypoplasia, asthma, gastrointestinal reflex, feeding disorders, and developmental delays;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia survivors sometimes endure long-term mechanical ventilation dependency, skeletal malformations, supplemental oxygen dependency, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and hypoxic brain injury;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia patients have a survival rate ranging from 62 percent to 90 percent depending on the severity of the defect, the treatment available at delivery, and whether extracorporeal membrane oxygenation must be used;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia has affected more than 600,000 babies throughout the world since 2000;   Whereas babies born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia endure extended hospital stays in intensive care with multiple surgeries;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia is as common a birth defect as spina bifida and cystic fibrosis;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia is diagnosed in utero in only 75 percent of cases;   Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia is treated through mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines (commonly known as“heart and lung bypass machines”) and surgical repair;   Whereas patients often outgrow congenital diaphragmatic hernia surgical repair, leading to reherniation and requiring additional surgery;   Whereas the occurrence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia does not discriminate based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status;   Whereas the cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is unknown;   Whereas the average hospital bill for a congenital diaphragmatic hernia patient is $500,000; and   Whereas the total annual cost of medical care for children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia in the United States is more than $800,000,000: Now, therefore be it
