Among the group were such legends as Sammy Baugh, Red Grange, George Halas, Don Hutson, Bronko Nagurski, and Jim Thorpe. Through 2012, 273 members had been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Three distinct iconic symbols represent an individual's membership in the Hall of Fame: a bronze bust, a Hall of Fame gold jacket, and a Hall of Fame ring.

The museum has grown from its original 19,000-square-foot building to a 118,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility, as a result of expansions in 1971, 1978, 1995, and most recently in 2011–2013. In addition, major exhibit renovations were completed in 2003, 2008, and 2009.
