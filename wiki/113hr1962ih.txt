=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Free Flow of Information Act of 2013”.

=Sec. 2. Compelled disclosure from covered persons=



==(a) Conditions for compelled disclosure– ==

In any matter arising under Federal law, a Federal entity may not compel a covered person to provide testimony or produce any document related to information obtained or created by such covered person as part of engaging in journalism, unless a court determines by a preponderance of the evidence, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to such covered person—
:(1) that the party seeking to compel production of such testimony or document has exhausted all reasonable alternative sources (other than the covered person) of the testimony or document;
:(2) that—
::(A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution, based on information obtained from a person other than the covered person—
:::(i) there are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has occurred; and
:::(ii) the testimony or document sought is critical to the investigation or prosecution or to the defense against the prosecution; or
::(B) in a matter other than a criminal investigation or prosecution, based on information obtained from a person other than the covered person, the testimony or document sought is critical to the successful completion of the matter;
:(3) in the case that the testimony or document sought could reveal the identity of a source of information or include any information that could reasonably be expected to lead to the discovery of the identity of such a source, that—
::(A) disclosure of the identity of such a source is necessary to prevent an act of terrorism against the United States or its allies or other significant and specified harm to national security with the objective to prevent such harm;
::(B) disclosure of the identity of such a source is necessary to prevent imminent death or significant bodily harm with the objective to prevent such death or harm, respectively; or
::(C) disclosure of the identity of such a source is necessary to identify a person who has disclosed—
:::(i) a trade secret, actionable under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1831 section 1831] or [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1832 1832 of title 18, United States Code] ;
:::(ii) individually identifiable health information, as such term is defined in section 1171(6) of the Social Security Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1320d 42 U.S.C. 1320d(6)] ] ), actionable under Federal law; or
:::(iii) nonpublic personal information, as such term is defined in section 509(4) of the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6809 15 U.S.C. 6809(4)] ), of any consumer actionable under Federal law; and
:(4) that the public interest in compelling disclosure of the information or document involved outweighs the public interest in gathering or disseminating news or information.

==(b) Limitations on content of information– ==

The content of any testimony or document that is compelled under subsection (a)shall—
:(1) not be overbroad, unreasonable, or oppressive and, as appropriate, be limited to the purpose of verifying published information or describing any surrounding circumstances relevant to the accuracy of such published information; and
:(2) be narrowly tailored in subject matter and period of time covered so as to avoid compelling production of peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.

==(c) Rule of construction– ==

Nothing in this Act shall be construed as applying to civil defamation, slander, or libel claims or defenses under State law, regardless of whether or not such claims or defenses, respectively, are raised in a State or Federal court.

=Sec. 3. Compelled disclosure from communications service providers=



==(a) Conditions for compelled disclosure– ==

With respect to testimony or any document consisting of any record, information, or other communication that relates to a business transaction between a communications service provider and a covered person, section 2shall apply to such testimony or document if sought from the communications service provider in the same manner that such section applies to any testimony or document sought from a covered person.

==(b) Notice and opportunity provided to covered persons– ==

A court may compel the testimony or disclosure of a document under this section only after the party seeking such a document provides the covered person who is a party to the business transaction described in subsection (a)—
:(1) notice of the subpoena or other compulsory request for such testimony or disclosure from the communications service provider not later than the time at which such subpoena or request is issued to the communications service provider; and
:(2) an opportunity to be heard before the court before the time at which the testimony or disclosure is compelled.

==(c) Exception to notice requirement– ==

Notice under subsection (b)(1)may be delayed only if the court involved determines by clear and convincing evidence that such notice would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal investigation.
