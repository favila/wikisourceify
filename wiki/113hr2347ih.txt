{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the National Labor Relations Act with respect to the criteria for determining employee units appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Representation Fairness Restoration Act” .

=Sec. 2. Determination of appropriate units for collective bargaining=

 Section 9(b) of the National Labor Relations Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text//  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/159 29 U.S.C. 159(b)] ] )is amended—
:(1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (3)as subparagraphs (A) through (C);
:(2) by striking “The Board shall decide” and all that follows through “or subdivision thereof:” and inserting the following:

<blockquote>(1) In each case, prior to an election, the [[w:National Labor Relations Board|Board]] shall determine, in order to assure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this Act, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining. Unless otherwise stated in this Act, and excluding any bargaining unit determination promulgated through rulemaking before August 26, 2011, the unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining shall consist of employees that share a sufficient community of interest. In determining whether employees share a sufficient community of interest, the [[w:National Labor Relations Board|Board]] shall consider—
::(A) similarity of wages, benefits, and working conditions;
::(B) similarity of skills and training;
::(C) centrality of management and common supervision;
::(D) extent of interchange and frequency of contact between employees;
::(E) integration of the work flow and interrelationship of the production process;
::(F) the consistency of the unit with the employer’s organizational structure;
::(G) similarity of job functions and work; and
::(H) the bargaining history in the particular unit and the industry.To avoid the proliferation or fragmentation of bargaining units, employees shall not be excluded from the unit unless the interests of the group seeking a separate unit are sufficiently distinct from those of other employees to warrant the establishment of a separate unit. Whether additional employees should be included in a proposed unit shall be determined based on whether such additional employees and proposed unit members share a sufficient community of interest, with the sole exception of proposed accretions to an existing unit, in which the inclusion of additional employees shall be based on whether such additional employees and existing unit members share an overwhelming community of interest and the additional employees have little or no separate identity.; and
</blockquote>

:(3) by striking “Provided,That the Board” and inserting the following:

<blockquote>
::(2) The [[w:National Labor Relations Board|Board]] .
