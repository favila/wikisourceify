=Sec. 3. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Risk of death among individuals with anorexia nervosa is 18 times greater than their same age peers without anorexia.
:(2) Health consequences such as osteoporosis (brittle bones), gastrointestinal complications, and dental problems are significant health and financial burdens throughout life.
:(3) An estimated 14 million people suffer from earing disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) (including binge eating disorder). The lifetime prevalence of all eating disorders in America is 0.6 to 4.5 percent.
:(4) Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses. They frequently coexist with other illnesses such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders. Eating disorders can become life-threatening if a person does not receive treatment.
:(5) Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss. An estimated 0.9 percent of American women and 0.3 percent of American men will suffer from anorexia nervosa in their lifetime.
:(6) Anorexia nervosa is associated with serious health consequences including heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and death.
:(7) Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by excessive food consumption followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, fasting, or excessive exercise. An estimated 1.5 percent of American women and 0.5 percent of American men will suffer from this disorder in their lifetime.
:(8) Bulimia nervosa is associated with cardiac, gastrointestinal, and dental problems including irregular heartbeats, gastric rupture, peptic ulcer, tooth decay, and death.
:(9) Binge eating disorder is characterized by frequent episodes of uncontrolled overeating. Binge eating disorder is common: an estimated 3.5 percent of American women and 2.0 percent of American men will suffer from this disorder in their lifetime.
:(10) Binge eating is associated with obesity, heart disease, gall bladder disease, and diabetes.
:(11) Many more suffer from some, but not all, of the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder, which is referred to as eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS). Between 4 percent and 20 percent of young women practice unhealthy patterns of dieting, purging, and binge eating.
:(12) Eating disorders are more common in women, but they do occur in men. Rates of binge eating disorder are similar in females and males.
:(13) Eating disorders usually appear in adolescence and are associated with substantial psychological problems, including depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Eating disorders also develop in younger children and adults, compromising health and daily functioning. For children 12 years of age and younger, hospitalizations for eating disorders increased by 119 percent between 1999 and 2006.
:(14) Eating disorders are found across races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups in the United States. White females are more likely to suffer from anorexia, while African-American girls are especially vulnerable to developing eating disorders that involve binge eating. Body dissatisfaction in young girls has been shown in White, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian girls.

=Sec. 4. Definition=

In this Act, the term eating disorder includes anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), as defined in the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or, if applicable, the most recent successor edition.
