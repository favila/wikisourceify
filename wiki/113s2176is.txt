The [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]], in consultation with the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], and the [[w:Small Business Administration|Small Business Administration]], shall report to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act on the processes necessary to develop a prospective reporting system in which an employer would be considered to have complied with section 6056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for future reporting periods if the employer provided information on a voluntary basis on the affordability and value of the health coverage offered by such employer, generally to whom it is offered, and the length of any waiting period.

==(b) Requirements– ==

The report under subsection (a) should address—

:(2) guidance on how employers who provide this information on a voluntary basis in advance may be considered exempt from general reporting requirements under section 6056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , and should instead be required only to provide individual reports to employees who have been deemed eligible for advance payment of premium tax credits;
:(3) any barriers that currently exist in data systems maintained by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]or the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]]which would hinder the development of such a verification system, and recommendations for addressing such barriers;
