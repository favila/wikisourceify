To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Energy, to conduct a study on the public health and environmental impacts of the production, transportation, storage, and use of petroleum coke, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Petroleum Coke Transparency and Public Health Study Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) In the past several years, United States crude oil refineries have grown their coking capacity to accommodate the conversion of heavy crude oils into refined petroleum products.
:(2) As coking capacity has grown, the domestic production of petroleum coke is expected to grow, leading to increases in the storage, transportation, and use of the material.
:(3) In Detroit, piles of petroleum coke have been stored in the open air on the banks of the Detroit River.
:(4) State regulators, communities, and industry stakeholders would benefit from a complete understanding of petroleum coke and the potential impact on public health and the environment related to the production, transportation, storage, and use of petroleum coke.
