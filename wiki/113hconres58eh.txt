 Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the need for the continued availability of religious services to members of the Armed Forces and their families during a lapse in appropriations.    Whereas the [[w:|Department of Defense]]has determined that some military chaplains and other personnel, including contract personnel, hired to perform duties of a military chaplain are not able to perform religious services on military installations during a lapse in appropriations;   Whereas this determination threatens the ability of members of the Armed Services and their families to exercise their First Amendment rights to worship and participate in religious activities; and   Whereas the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]has permitted the performance of First Amendment activities in areas controlled by the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]despite the lapse in appropriations: Now, therefore, be it     That [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]â€” 
:(1) recognizes that the performance of religious services and the provision of ministry are protected activities under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; 
:(2) urges and intends that the [[w:|Secretary of Defense]]permit the performance of religious services on property owned or maintained by the [[w:|Department of Defense]], during any lapse in appropriations, in the same manner and to the same extent as such religious services are otherwise available; and 
:(3) urges and intends that the [[w:|Secretary of Defense]]permit military chaplains and other personnel, including contract personnel, hired to perform duties of a military chaplain to perform religious services and ministry, during any lapse in appropriations, in the same manner and to the same extent as such chaplains and other personnel are otherwise permitted to perform religious services and ministry.
