{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a commission to examine the United States monetary policy, evaluate alternative monetary regimes, and recommend a course for monetary policy going forward.

={{anchor|H6D417CAA4B8B45CF84EE4E7DCA619A67}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Centennial Monetary Commission Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H3FF87CF605714F9C87E4564907F5D6CB}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Constitution endows [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] with the power“to coin money, regulate the value thereof”.
:(2) Following the financial crisis known as the Panic of 1907, Congress established the National Monetary Commission to provide recommendations for the reform of the financial and monetary systems of the United States.
:(3) Incorporating several of the recommendations of the National Monetary Commission, Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913. As currently organized, the Federal Reserve System consists of the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors]] in Washington, District of Columbia, and the Federal Reserve Banks organized into 12 districts around the United States. The stockholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks include national and certain state-chartered commercial banks, which operate on a fractional reserve basis.
:(4) Originally, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] gave the Federal Reserve a monetary mandate to provide an elastic currency, within the context of a gold standard, in response to seasonal fluctuations in the demand for currency.
:(5) Congress also gave the Federal Reserve a financial stability mandate to serve as the lender of last resort to solvent but illiquid banks during a financial crisis.
:(6) In 1977, Congress changed the monetary mandate of the Federal Reserve to a dual mandate for maximum employment and stable prices.
:(7) Empirical studies and historical evidence, both within the United States and in other countries, demonstrate that price stability is desirable because both inflation and deflation damage the economy.
:(8) The economic challenge of recent years—most notably the bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of 2008, and the ensuing anemic recovery—have occurred at great cost in terms of lost jobs and output.
:(9) Policymakers are reexamining the structure and functioning of financial institutions and markets to determine what, if any, changes need to be made to place the financial system on a stronger, more sustainable path going forward.
:(10) The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions in response to the recent economic challenges.
:(11) The Federal Open Market Committee has engaged in multiple rounds of quantitative easing, providing unprecedented liquidity to financial markets, while committing to holding short-term interest rates low for a seemingly indefinite period, and pursuing a policy of credit allocation by purchasing Federal agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.
:(12) In the wake of the recent extraordinary actions of the [[w:Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Federal Reserve]] , [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] —consistent with its constitutional responsibilities and as it has done periodically throughout the history of the United States—has once again renewed its examination of monetary policy.
:(13) Central in such examination has been a renewed look at what is the most proper mandate for the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy in the 21st century.

::(A) discretion in determining monetary policy without an operational regime;
