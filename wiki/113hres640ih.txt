[[w:Mark Takano|Mr. Takano]](for himself and

{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of“Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week”.    Whereas Helen Keller was one of the most accomplished, respected, and renowned Americans who was deaf-blind;   Whereas the loss of both vision and hearing, one of the most severe of all disabilities, affects approximately 1.2 million people in the United States;   Whereas more than 34 million Americans have hearing loss;   Whereas approximately 21 million Americans have vision problems;   Whereas approximately 80 million Americans have potentially blinding eye diseases;   Whereas there are approximately 59,300 legally blind children in the United States;   Whereas today, people who are deaf-blind are attending college, participating in social activities, managing their everyday lives and actively engaged in their community through employment and civic activities;   Whereas it is highly appropriate and necessary to publicize the abilities and potential of our fellow citizens who are deaf-blind, or who have severe vision and hearing loss, and to recognize Helen Keller as a guiding example of courage, hope, determination, and achievement for other individuals who are deaf-blind;   Whereas in 1984, responding to the need for more awareness about the Deaf-Blind community, Congress passed a resolution marking the last week in June as Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week;   Whereas the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]recognizes June 22–28, 2014, as Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week; and   Whereas the theme of the Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week of 2014 is“She’s Deaf-Blind and, with technology, she holds the world in her hands … just like her loved ones”: Now, therefore, be it
