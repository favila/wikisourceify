{{Center|
[[w:|Mr. Pryor]] (for himself and
[[w:|Mr. Enzi]] ) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a motor and motor-driven systems market assessment and public awareness program, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “ Motor Systems Market Awareness Act of 2014” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds that—
:(1) motors and motor-driven systems account for a significant quantity of the electricity used in the United States;
:(2) motor electrical energy use is determined by the efficiency of the motor and the design of the motor-driven system in which the motor and the drive operate;
:(3) Federal Government research on commercial and industrial motors and motor-driven system use and efficiency is outdated;
:(4) the [[w:Bureau of the Census|Bureau of the Census]] has discontinued collection of data on motor and generator importation, manufacture, shipment, and sales;
:(5) the last [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] motor market assessment was conducted in 2002;
:(6) motor and motor-driven systems have changed dramatically during the 12-year period ending on the date of enactment of this Act; and
:(7) a new motor and motor-driven system market assessment will help United States manufacturers better understand the commercial marketplace and become more globally competitive.

=Sec. 3. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Department– ==

The term Department means the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] .

==(2) Interested parties– ==

The term interested parties includes—
:(A) trade associations;
:(B) motor manufacturers;
:(C) manufacturers of variable speed drives, including variable frequency drives;
:(D) motor end users, including original equipment manufacturers that use motors to drive machinery;
:(E) permanent magnetic material manufacturers;
:(F) electric utilities; and
:(G) individuals and entities that conduct energy efficiency programs.

==(3) Secretary– ==

The term Secretary means the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] .

=Sec. 4. Motor market assessment=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] , in consultation with interested parties, shall conduct a market assessment of motors and motor-driven systems used in the United States.

==(b) Assessment– ==

In conducting the assessment under subsection (a), the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall—
:(1) develop a detailed profile of the stock of motors and motor-driven systems in commercial and industrial facilities of the United States (as of the date of enactment of this Act);
:(2) develop a profile of commercial and industrial motor and motor-driven system purchase and maintenance practices;
:(3) analyze the opportunities (by market segment) for improved energy efficiency and cost savings available through—
::(A) the use of energy efficient motors, variable speed drives, servo drives, and other control technologies;
::(B) optimization of motor-driven systems; and
::(C) substitution of existing motor designs with new and future advanced motor and motor-driven system designs, including—
:::(i) electronically commutated permanent magnet motors;
:::(ii) interior permanent magnet motors;
:::(iii) switched reluctance motors;
:::(iv) synchronous reluctance motors; and
:::(v) variable speed drives; and
:(4) evaluate the state of the global supply chain that supports motor and drive technologies (as of the date of enactment of this Act), including—
::(A) the accessibility and sustainability of key materials;
::(B) the progress of research and development directed at decreasing the quantity of heavy rare earth materials required in high energy density permanent magnets; and
::(C) factors that may lead to an increase in domestic manufacturing of motor and drive technologies.

==(c) Report– ==

Not later than 540 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall publish and make available on the website of the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department]] a report on the assessment conducted under this section.

==(d) Recommendations– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] shall use the assessment and report required under this section—
:(1) to develop recommendations to update the detailed motor and motor-driven system profile on a periodic basis using readily available market information; and
:(2) to identify technology and research needs that could be met through joint industry and government partnership.

=Sec. 5. Public awareness program=

Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] , in consultation with interested parties, shall establish a program targeted at motor end-users to increase the awareness of the end-users of—
:(1) the energy efficiency and cost saving opportunities available to commercial and industrial facilities from using higher efficiency motors and motor-driven system technologies;
:(2) motor and motor-driven system procurement and management procedures; and
:(3) criteria for making decisions for new, replacement, or repair of motor and motor-driven system components.
