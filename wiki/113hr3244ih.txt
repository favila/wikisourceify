==(b) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Manufacturing has been the backbone of the Nation’s economy for more than a century.
:(2) In 2012, manufacturers contributed $1.87 trillion to the economy.
:(3) More than 12 million workers are employed in the manufacturing sector.
:(4) In many sectors there is a pronounced shift to high-skilled manufacturing jobs, and potential employees must possess high-level skills in order to compete in the job market.
:(5) In 2011,
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]]announced an expansion of the Manufacturing Skills Certification System as a part of the Skills for America’s Future Program. The Manufacturing Skills Certification System is a collaborative effort between private industry and the [[w:National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology]]to create manufacturing credentials that would be universally recognizable. The credential program was designed by the Manufacturing Institute, a non-profit arm of the National Association of Manufacturers. Since its inception in 2011 more than 173,000 certifications have been issued.
:(6) Centers across the country, such as the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology, have been working diligently to educate employers about the value of credentials, as well as working with local education centers to promote these credentials. These centers bridge the gap between employers and potential employees and assist in the creation and retention of jobs, and highlight the importance of supporting and patronizing local manufacturers and businesses.
