{{Center|A BILL}}

 To improve the Federal Pell Grant program, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Pell Grant Protection Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to restore the role of Federal Pell Grants as the foundational Federal investment in higher education, in order to strengthen the economy of the United States by improving opportunities for low-income students to complete higher education and join the middle class. 

=Sec. 3. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Federal Pell Grants provided under  section 401 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1070a 20 U.S.C. 1070a])(referred to in this Act as“Federal Pell Grants”) have historically been the fundamental Federal investment in helping low-income students pay for college and enter the middle class. In the 1979–1980 academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant paid for 77 percent of the average cost of attendance at an in-State, 4-year institution of higher education. However, in the 2012–2013 academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant covered only about 30 percent of that average cost of attendance.
:(2) The program providing Federal Pell Grants already acts as a quasi-entitlement, in which both mandatory funding and discretionary funding combine to maintain a maximum Federal Pell Grant amount.
:(3) The [[w:Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office]]reports on any overall financial surplus or shortfall in the funding provided for the Federal Pell Grant program. However, in recent years, in order to meet the maximum Federal Pell Grant level with the provided level of funding, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has made cuts to the program through imposing additional eligibility requirements for Federal Pell Grants and limiting the availability of year-round Federal Pell Grants, causing significant uncertainty and reducing access to higher education for millions of hardworking college students.
:(4) Removing the Federal Pell Grant program from the uncertainty of the congressional discretionary appropriations process will improve student access to, and the affordability of, higher education.
:(5) The“traditional student”who attends college for 4 years immediately after high school is now a minority of college students today. Ambitious students now need more flexibility to attend school year-round while juggling work schedules.
:(6)    Section 1860 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ([[Public Law 112-10|Public Law 112–10]] ,125 Stat. 169)eliminated the provision of the Federal Pell Grant program of the  Higher Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1070a 20 U.S.C. 1070a et seq.])that allowed 2 Federal Pell Grant awards per year, creating significant hardship for many students trying to take courses over the summer or outside the traditional school calendar. Allowing students to continue to receive Federal Pell Grants in successive semesters, without a gap, would reduce the time needed to complete their degrees. 

=Sec. 4. Converting the traditional Federal Pell Grant program to a mandatory spending program=
