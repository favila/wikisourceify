{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating July 24, 2014, as“International Self-Care Day”.    Whereas chronic diseases impose high costs in the United States in the forms of human capital, medical expenditures, and economic productivity;   Whereas chronic diseases are the leading cause of disability and death in the United States, and chronic diseases account for 7 out of 10 deaths in the United States;   Whereas approximately 25 percent of individuals with a chronic disease have some limitation on daily living activities and may be restricted from working or attending school;   Whereas chronic diseases account for $3 of every $4 spent on health care in the United States, including— 
:(1) $432,000,000,000 spent annually on heart disease and stroke; 
:(2) $174,000,000,000 spent annually on diabetes; 
:(3) $154,000,000,000 spent annually on lung disease; and 
:(4) $148,000,000,000 spent annually on Alzheimer's Disease;   Whereas the adoption of proactive healthy behaviors and lifestyles by individuals will materially reduce the burden of chronic diseases in the United States;   Whereas it is not possible to meet the enormous challenges presented by chronic diseases, the aging of the population, and other demographic changes without engaging individuals to be active participants in maintaining their health and well-being;   Whereas self-care can reduce the human and economic costs of chronic diseases, help individuals achieve better overall health, and prevent or delay many diseases;   Whereas self-care includes simple actions that individuals can take for themselves and their families to stay healthy, treat minor illnesses, and prevent or manage long-term conditions;   Whereas self-care entails a lifelong habit and culture of— 
:(1) making healthy lifestyle choices on a daily basis; 
:(2) practicing good hygiene to prevent infection and illness; 
:(3) avoiding unhealthy and risky actions; 
:(4) monitoring for signs and symptoms of changes in health; 
:(5) taking care of minor ailments; and 
:(6) knowing when to consult a doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional;   Whereas individuals need greater access to tools that enable better self-care, including those that improve health literacy, promote good nutrition and overall wellness, facilitate physical activity, and prevent and manage chronic diseases;   Whereas over-the-counter medicines (commonly known as“self-care medicines”in other regions of the world) are some of the most important self-care tools, and help individuals improve wellness, treat everyday ailments, and prevent chronic diseases;   Whereas every $1 spent on over-the-counter medicines in the United States each year saves the health care system in the United States $6 to $7, accounting for $102,000,000,000 in annual savings relative to treatment alternatives;   Whereas self-care and the responsible use of over-the-counter medicines can help individuals avoid unnecessary visits to health care professionals, easing the burden on those health care professionals;   Whereas self-care empowers individuals with higher self-esteem, improves wellness, and reduces the use of health care services;   Whereas individuals in the United States have not sufficiently taken advantage of the potential of self-care to improve health, reduce the burden of chronic disease, and strengthen the sustainability of the health care system in the United States; and   Whereas achieving the full potential of self-care is the shared responsibility of consumers, policymakers, regulators, and health care professionals: Now, therefore, be it

:(4) acknowledges that“International Self-Care Day”is recognized by health care organizations and parties with an interest in health care around the world.
