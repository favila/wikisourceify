 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—

:(2) the Watershed—
::(A) is the only area in the State that is not a unit of National Wilderness Preservation System to achieve a designation of outstanding waters by the State;
::(B) provides a crucial source of clean drinking water for the residents of the Animas River Valley and the city of Durango, Colorado; and
::(C) provides high quality agricultural water supplies from Hermosa Creek and the Animas River;
:(3) the Watershed helps ensure the economic prosperity of local communities in the area that depend on the Watershed for water supplies, recreation, hunting, fishing, hiking, biking, camping, skiing and related winter activities, off-road vehicle travel, scientific research, mineral extraction, and sustainable natural resource development;
:(4) the world-class Hermosa Creek trail network contains outstanding single track mountain bike riding, backcountry hiking, equestrian riding, and motorcycle riding;
:(5) the Watershed provides visitors the opportunity to enjoy the tremendous scenic, natural, cultural, and recreational resources of the area;
:(6) ecologically sustainable grazing has been conducted in a manner that has preserved the high quality of the Watershed;
:(7) the native Colorado River cutthroat trout fishery located in the Watershed—
::(A) is one of the most important fisheries in the State;
::(B) is crucial for the long-term survival of the cutthroat trout; and
::(C) provides an opportunity for anglers to have a catch and release fishery for the cutthroat trout;
:(8) the work of Colorado Parks and Wildlife to enhance the fishery referred to in paragraph (7)has been a tremendous success and a great example of cooperative conservation efforts to recover an imperiled species of fish;
:(9) the Watershed—
::(A) provides some of the best backcountry elk habitat in the State; and
