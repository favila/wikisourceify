      Findings and
			 sense of Congress
			
        (a)
        Findings
        
          
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
            
			 finds the following:
				
          (1)
          For more than 100
			 years before 1999, all disabled military retirees were required to fund their
			 own veterans’ disability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned
			 retired pay for each dollar received in veterans’ disability
			 compensation.
				
        
          (2)
          Since 1999,
			 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             has enacted legislation to progressively expand eligibility criteria
			 for relief of the retired pay disability offset and reduce the burden of
			 financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.
				
        
          (3)
          Absent adequate
			 funding to eliminate the sacrifice for all disabled retirees, 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             has
			 given initial priority to easing financial inequities for the most severely
			 disabled and for combat-disabled retirees.
				
        
          (4)
          In the interest of maximizing eligibility
			 within cost constraints, 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             effectively has authorized full concurrent
			 receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent disability ratings and all
			 qualifying retirees with combat-related disability ratings, while phasing out
			 the disability offset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with
			 noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90
			 percent.
				
        
          (5)
          In pursuing these
			 good-faith efforts, 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating
			 new thresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing to disabled
			 retirees who fall short of meeting those new thresholds.
				
        
          (6)
          
            
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             is not
			 content with the status quo.
				
      
      
        (b)
        Sense of
			 Congress
        It is the sense of 
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             that military retired pay
			 earned by service and sacrifice in defending the United States should not be
			 reduced because a military retiree is also eligible for veterans’ disability
			 compensation awarded for service-connected disability.
