To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for reporting and disclosure by State and local public employee retirement pension plans.

={{anchor|HF427731770FD44E9B28D2F95AD1FFF4A}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Public Employee Pension Transparency Act”.

={{anchor|H221489E563DF4FB5B194B54D68A870D9}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Pursuant to clauses 1 and 3 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States, the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has the authority to condition the continuation of certain specified Federal tax benefits upon State or local government employee pension benefit plans on the provision of meaningful disclosure under section 4980J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by this Act.
:(2) State and local government employee pension benefit plans have promised pension benefits to approximately 20,000,000 Americans who are active employees of these entities. An additional 7,000,000 retirees and their dependents currently receive benefits from State or local government employee pension benefit plans. The interests of participants in many of such plans are in the nature of property rights under State law.
:(3) State and local government employee pension benefit plans are substantially facilitated by the favorable tax treatment of participants and beneficiaries, investment earnings, and employee contributions with respect to such plans provided by the Federal Government under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
:(4) The investment of State or local government employee pension benefit plan assets, the distribution of benefits under such plans, and other related financial activities are facilitated through the use of instrumentalities of, and substantially affect, interstate commerce. These activities, which are interstate in nature and have a substantial impact on the national economy, affect capital formation, regional growth and decline, the national markets for insurance, and the markets for securities and the trading of securities of State and local governments.
:(5) The financial status of State or local government employee pension benefit plans also has a direct impact on the national markets for insurance and trading of securities of State and local governments.
:(6) State or local government employee pension benefit plans additionally have a substantial impact on interstate commerce as a consequence of the interstate movement of participants.
:(7) State or local government employee pension benefit plans are becoming a large financial burden on certain State and local governments and have already resulted in tax increases and the reduction of services.
:(8) In fact, a recent study published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that the present value of the already promised pension liabilities of the 50 States amount to $5,170,000,000,000 and that these pension plans are unfunded by $3,230,000,000,000. Another study determined that the total unfunded liability for all municipal plans in the United States is $574,000,000,000.
:(9) Some economists and observers have stated that the extent to which State or local government employee pension benefit plans are underfunded is obscured by governmental accounting rules and practices, particularly as they relate to the valuation of plan assets and liabilities. This results in a misstatement of the value of plan assets and an understatement of plan liabilities, a situation that poses a significant threat to the soundness of State and local budgets.
:(10) There currently is a lack of meaningful disclosure regarding the value of State or local government employee pension benefit plan assets and liabilities. This lack of meaningful disclosure poses a direct and serious threat to the financial stability of such plans and their sponsoring governments, impairs the ability of State and local government taxpayers and officials to understand the financial obligations of their government, and reduces the likelihood that State and local government processes will be effective in assuring the prudent management of their plans. The status quo also constitutes a serious threat to the future economic health of the Nation and places an undue burden upon State and local government taxpayers, who will be called upon to fully fund existing, and future, pension promises.
:(11) State or local government employee pension benefit plans affect the national public interest and meaningful disclosure of the value of their assets and liabilities is necessary and desirable in order to adequately protect plan participants and their beneficiaries and the general public. Meaningful disclosure would also further efforts to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce.
