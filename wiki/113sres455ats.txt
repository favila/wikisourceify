{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating May 2014 as“Older Americans Month”.    Whereas President John F. Kennedy first designated May as“Senior Citizens Month”in 1963;   Whereas in 1963, only 17,000,000 individuals living in the United States were age 65 or older, approximately 1/3 of such individuals lived in poverty, and few programs existed to meet the needs of older individuals in the United States;   Whereas in 2014, there are more than 43,000,000 individuals age 65 or older in the United States, and such individuals account for 13.7 percent of the total population of the United States;   Whereas in 2014, more than 9,600,000 veterans of the Armed Forces are age 65 or older;   Whereas older individuals in the United States rely on Federal programs, such as Social Security, the Medicare program, the Medicaid program, for financial security and high-quality affordable health care;   Whereas the  Older Americans Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3001 42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.] )provides supportive services to help individuals of the United States who are age 60 or older maintain maximum independence in their homes and communities;   Whereas the Older Americans Act of 1965 provides funding for programs, including nutrition services, transportation, and care management, to assist more than 11,000,000 older individuals in the United States each year;   Whereas compared to older individuals in the United States in past generations, older individuals in the United States in 2014 are working longer, living longer, and enjoying healthier, more active, and more independent lifestyles;   Whereas more than 4,300,000 individuals in the United States age 65 or older continue to work as full-time, year-round employees;   Whereas older individuals in the United States play an important role in society by continuing to contribute their experience, knowledge, wisdom, and accomplishments;   Whereas older individuals in the United States play vital roles in their communities and remain involved in volunteer work, mentoring activities, the arts, cultural activities, and civic engagement; and   Whereas a society that recognizes the success of older individuals and continues to enhance their access to quality and affordable health care will encourage the ongoing participation and heightened independence of such individuals and will ensure the continued safety and well-being of such individuals:
