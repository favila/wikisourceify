{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Condemning the Ukrainian separatists illegally occupying the Ukrainian city of Donetsk, and the surrounding territory, as terrorists for shooting down a civilian passenger airliner, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, and condemning the Government of the Russian Federation for supplying the arms.    Whereas the city of Donetsk, and the surrounding area, are recognized by the United States as being under the jurisdiction of the Government of Ukraine;   Whereas the city is occupied by a militant group wishing autonomy from the Government of Ukraine;   Whereas this entity, calling itself the Donetsk People’s Republic, is not recognized as being autonomous by any sovereign nation;   Whereas the United States believes actions made by the separatists in Donetsk are efforts by the Russian Federation to destabilize the Ukraine;   Whereas the United States-Ukraine ambassador Geoffrey R. Pyatt characterized the separatists in Donetsk as terrorists;   Whereas Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down by a SA–11 Gadfly within the surrounding area of Donetsk;   Whereas the act of targeting, engaging, and destroying a passenger airline of non-combatants is considered an act of terror;   Whereas the SA–11 Gadfly is a Russian made Buk surface-to-air missile system; and   Whereas producing weapons to a terrorist organization is considered by the international community as“state-sponsored terrorism”: Now, therefore, be it
