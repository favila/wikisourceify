{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, race, or national origin, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the “Fair Pay Act of 2013” .

==(b) Reference– ==

Except as provided in section 8, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/201 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] ).

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Wage rate differentials exist between equivalent jobs segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government employment and in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.
:(2) The existence of such wage rate differentials—
::(A) depresses wages and living standards for employees necessary for their health and efficiency;
::(B) prevents the maximum utilization of the available labor resources;
::(C) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and obstructing commerce;
::(D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and
::(E) constitutes an unfair method of competition.
:(3) Discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a role in maintaining a segregated work force.
:(4) Many women and people of color work in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin.
:(5) 
::(A) In 2009, a woman in the United States working in a full-time, year-round job earned 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man working in a full-time, year-round job.
::(B) A 2007 study found that—even when accounting for key factors generally known to influence earnings such as race, educational attainment, and experience—nearly half (49.3 percent) of the pay gap can be explained by differences in the industries and occupations that men and women work in, and 41 percent of the pay gap cannot be accounted for but may be partially explained by discrimination in the workplace.
:(6)  Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938prohibits discrimination in compensation for “equal work” on the basis of sex.
:(7) Artificial barriers to the elimination of discrimination in compensation based upon sex, race, and national origin continue to exist more than 4 decades after the passage of section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and theCivil Rights Act of 1964( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000a 42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.] ). Elimination of such barriers would have positive effects, including—
::(A) providing a solution to problems in the economy created by discrimination through wage rate differentials;
::(B) substantially reducing the number of working women and people of color earning low wages, thereby reducing the dependence on public assistance; and
::(C) promoting stable families by enabling working family members to earn a fair rate of pay.

:::(B) Nothing in subparagraph (A)shall prohibit the payment of different wage rates to employees where such payment is made pursuant to—
::::(i) a seniority system;
::::(ii) a merit system;

::::::(aa) such factor—
:::::::(AA) is job-related with respect to the position in question; or
:::::::(BB) furthers a legitimate business purpose, except that this item shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an alternative employment practice exists that would serve the same business purpose without producing such differential and that the employer has refused to adopt such alternative practice; and
::::::(bb) such factor was actually applied and used reasonably in light of the asserted justification; and
:::::(II) upon the employer succeeding under subclause (I), the employee fails to demonstrate that the differential produced by the reliance of the employer on such factor is itself the result of discrimination on the basis of sex, race, or national origin by the employer.
:::(C) The [[w:Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] shall issue guidelines specifying criteria for determining whether a job is dominated by employees of a particular sex, race, or national origin for purposes of subparagraph (B)(iv). Such guidelines shall not include a list of such jobs.
:::(D) An employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of subparagraph (A)shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of such subparagraph, reduce the wage rate of any employee.
::(2) No labor organization or its agents representing employees of an employer having employees subject to any provision of this section shall cause or attempt to cause such an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of paragraph (1)(A).
::(3) For purposes of administration and enforcement of this subsection, any amounts owing to any employee that have been withheld in violation of paragraph (1)(A)shall be deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this sectionor section 7.
::(4) In this subsection:
:::(A) The term labor organization means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and that exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.
:::(B) The term equivalent jobs means jobs that may be dissimilar, but whose requirements are equivalent, when viewed as a composite of skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions..
