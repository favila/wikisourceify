:(2) In a statement submitted to theCommittee on the Judiciary of the Senateon July 27, 2011, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that“<nowiki>[t]he State Department has no greater responsibility than the protection of U.S. citizens overseas—particularly when Americans find themselves in the custody of a foreign government, facing an unfamiliar, and at times unfair, legal system.</nowiki>”.
:(3) Some United States citizens in the custody of a foreign government have been and continue to be denied fundamental due process and human rights under both local and international law by foreign government officials.
:(4) Mr. Jacob Ostreicher, who was detained in the notorious Palmasola prison in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, from June 4, 2011, until December 18, 2012, and was subsequently placed under house arrest, is one of the United States citizens who currently is enduring multiple, egregious, and continuous violations of his fundamental due process and human rights under both local and international law.
