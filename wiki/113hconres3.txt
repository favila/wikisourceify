{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of Congress that the
		  use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear
		  authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and
		  misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring
			 [[United States Congress|Congress’]] exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11
			 of the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it



{{section|H447D75BF404342AA8432008A78EB3845|}}
That it is the sense of [[United States Congress|Congress]]
			 that, except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory
			 of the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President
			 without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates [[United States Congress|Congress’]]
			 exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the
			 Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and
			 misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.
