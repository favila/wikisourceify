:(9) 
::(A) As a condition of a grant or contract under which funds are made available to a State under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/4102A subsection (b)(5)]in order to carry out[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/4103A section 4103A]or[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/4104 4104]of this title, the State shall—
:::(i) establish a program under which the State administers an examination to each veteran seeking a license or credential issued by the State and issues such license or credential to such veteran without requiring such veteran to undergo any training or apprenticeship if the veteran—
::::(I) receives a satisfactory score on completion of such examination, as determined by the State;
::::(II) has been awarded a military occupational speciality that is substantially equivalent to or exceeds the requirements of the State for the issuance of such license or credential;
::::(III) has engaged in the active practice of the occupation for which the veteran is seeking such license or credential for at least two of the five years preceding the date of application for such license or credential; and
::::(IV) pays any customary or usual fees required by the State for such license or credential; and
:::(ii) submit each year to the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] a report on the exams administered under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/4102A clause (i)]during the most recently completed 12-month period that includes, for the period covered by the report, the number of veterans who completed an exam administered by the State under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/4102A clause (i)]and a description of the results of such exams, disaggregated by occupational field.
::(B) The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] may waive the requirement under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/4102A subparagraph (A)]that a State establish a program described in that subparagraph as a condition of a grant or contract if the State certifies to the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] that the State—
:::(i) takes into account previous military training for the purposes of issuing licenses or credentials;
:::(ii) permits veterans to completely satisfy through examination any training or testing requirements for a license or credential with respect to which a veteran has previously completed military training; and
:::(iii) for any credential or license for which a veteran is unable to completely satisfy such requirements through examination, substantially reduces training time required to satisfy such requirement based on the military training received by the veteran.
::(C) Not less frequently than once each year, the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] a report summarizing the information received by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/4102A subparagraph (A)(ii)]. .
