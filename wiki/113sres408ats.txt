{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the designation of April as“Parkinson’s Awareness Month”.    Whereas Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive, and neurological disease and is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States;   Whereas there is inadequate data on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson’s disease, but the disease affects an estimated 500,000 to 1,500,000 individuals in the United States and the prevalence of such disease is estimated to more than double by 2040;   Whereas according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Parkinson’s disease is the 14th leading cause of death in the United States and the age-adjusted death rate for individuals with Parkinson's disease increased 2.9 percent from 2010 to 2011;   Whereas every day, Parkinson's disease greatly impacts millions of individuals in the United States who are caregivers, family members, and friends of individuals with Parkinson's disease;   Whereas the economic burden of Parkinson’s disease is an estimated $14,400,000,000 each year, including indirect costs to patients and family members of $6,300,000,000 each year;   Whereas although research suggests that the cause of Parkinson’s disease is a combination of genetic and environmental factors, the exact cause and the exact progression of the disease remain unknown;   Whereas an objective test or biomarker for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease does not exist, and the rate of misdiagnosis for the disease is high;   Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease vary from person to person and include tremors, slowness of movement, rigidity, difficulty with balance, swallowing, chewing, and speaking, cognitive impairment, dementia, mood disorders (such as depression and anxiety), constipation, skin complications, and sleep difficulties;   Whereas a cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt the progression of Parkinson’s disease does not exist;   Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson’s disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with dose-limiting side effects, and such medications ultimately lose effectiveness, leaving the patient unable to move, speak, or swallow; and   Whereas developing more effective treatments for Parkinson's disease with fewer side effects and ultimately finding a cure for the disease require increased education and research: Now, therefore, be it
