To establish the Commission on American Discoveries and

={{anchor|H5C42BDBACA644322991DE4DB9BCF7004}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the
			 “American Discoveries and American Jobs
			 Commission Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H53A7ABF8E7BE4D659C8E335243CF8850}}Sec. 2. Establishment=

There is established a commission to be
			 known as the “Commission on American Discoveries and American
			 Jobs” (in this Act referred to as the Commission).

={{anchor|H06FC4B929CAB45FC991958F0F04F9A11}}Sec. 3. Findings=

[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Federal
			 Government is estimated to have spent $147,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2010 on
			 research and development (not including funds allocated under the American
			 Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111–5)) to meet the mission
			 requirements of the Federal departments and agencies.
:(2) Federal Government
			 research and development has led to new products and processes for the
			 commercial marketplace, including antibiotics, plastics, airplanes, computers,
			 microwaves, and bioengineered drugs.
:(3) There are many
			 other technologies and techniques generated in the Federal laboratory system
			 that could have market value if further developed by the industrial community,
			 and the knowledge base created by the research and development activities of
			 such system can serve as a foundation for additional commercially relevant
			 efforts in the private sector.
:(4) Technological
			 progress is responsible for up to half the growth of the United States economy
			 and is the principal driving force behind long-term economic growth and
			 increases in our standard of living.
:(5) It is only through
			 commercialization, a function of the business sector, that a significant
			 stimulus to economic growth occurs. Thus, there is congressional interest in
			 accelerating development and commercialization activities in the private sector
			 through legislation.
:(6) Royalties derived
			 from intellectual property rights provide the academic community a way to
			 support further research and the business sector a means to obtain a return on
			 their financial contributions to such research.

The [[Wikipedia:|Commission]] shall conduct a study to
			 examine—
:(1) the state of
			 technology transfer from federally funded research to the private
			 sector;
:(2) the possibilities
			 for the Federal Government to collect royalties from early research that leads
			 to the commercialization of a profitable product or technology;
:(3) the potential
			 adverse consequences of such royalties on technology transfer,
			 commercialization, and economic growth; and
:(4) the potential
			 benefits of reinvesting revenues from Federal royalties into science,
			 technology, engineering, and math education, and seeding future federally
			 funded research;

:(2) reinvest such
			 royalties in science, technology, engineering, and math education and future
			 Federal research;
:(3) ensure products
			 resulting from Federal research are manufactured in the United States;
