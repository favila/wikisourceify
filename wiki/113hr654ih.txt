To amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to reauthorize technical assistance to small public water systems, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H593FACA8584A47EA98DB7044DE8A7C1A}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Grassroots Rural and Small Community Water Systems Assistance Act”.

={{anchor|H200A3AF723BF444D8F1125B062DC34E0}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996([[Public Law 104-182|Public Law 104–182]] )authorized technical assistance for small and rural communities to assist those communities in complying with regulations promulgated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300f 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.] );
:(2) technical assistance and compliance training—
::(A) ensures that Federal regulations do not overwhelm the resources of small and rural communities; and
::(B) provides small and rural communities lacking technical resources with the necessary skills to improve and protect water resources;
:(3) across the United States, more than 90 percent of the community water systems serve a population of less than 10,000 individuals;
:(4) small and rural communities have the greatest difficulty providing safe, affordable public drinking water and wastewater services due to limited economies of scale and lack of technical expertise; and
:(5) in addition to being the main source of compliance assistance, small and rural water technical assistance has been the main source of emergency response assistance in small and rural communities.

={{anchor|HC7877FC12DF640D9A275D81730B6EE5A}}Sec. 3. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) to most effectively assist small and rural communities, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] should prioritize the types of technical assistance that are most beneficial to those communities, based on input from those communities; and
:(2) local support is the key to making Federal assistance initiatives work in small and rural communities to the maximum benefit.

 Section 1442(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300j–1 42 U.S.C. 300j–1(e)] )is amended—
:(1) by designating the first through seventh sentences as paragraphs (1) through (7), respectively;
:(2) in paragraph (5)(as so designated), by striking“1997 through 2003”and inserting“2014 through 2019”; and
:(3) by adding at the end the following:
