(a)
Findings
The
			 [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
(1)
approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows
			 are held annually across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees
			 per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and unlicensed firearms
			 sellers; and

(2)
gun shows at which
			 firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange provide a convenient and
			 centralized commercial location where criminals and other prohibited persons
			 obtain firearms without background checks and without records that enable
			 firearm tracing.


(b)

          Section 921(a) of title 18, United States
