{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month.    Whereas more than 5,200,000 people are estimated to live with posttraumatic stress disorder during the course of a given year in the United States;   Whereas women are more likely than men to develop posttraumatic stress disorder during their lifetime;   Whereas according to the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]], experts believe roughly 11 to 20 percent of veterans who served in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder;   Whereas less than 40 percent of returning military personnel seek assistance;   Whereas as many as 10 percent of veterans who served in the Persian Gulf War and 30 percent of veterans who served during the Vietnam era suffer from the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder;   Whereas without treatment, posttraumatic stress disorder can lead to alcohol and drug abuse, flashbacks, heart attacks, depression, suicide, and stroke;   Whereas posttraumatic stress disorder can cause pernicious effects in families and communities;   Whereas raising public awareness of this condition will help facilitate the discovery of effective treatment options, therapies and a cure; and   Whereas the dedication of organizations, researchers, doctors, medical facilities of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]], and people working across the United States to improve the quality of life of people living with posttraumatic stress disorder should be commended: Now, therefore, be it
