 To cap the emissions of greenhouse gases through a requirement to purchase carbon permits, to distribute the proceeds of such purchases to eligible individuals, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Healthy Climate and Family Security Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds the following:
:(1) Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, with CO2in the atmosphere reaching 400 parts per million in 2013 for the first time in human history.
:(2) The warming of our planet has led to more frequent, dangerous and expensive extreme weather events, including heat waves, storms, fires, droughts, floods and tornadoes.
:(3) More than 97 percent of climate scientists agree that our planet is warming, primarily because of the extraction and burning of fossil fuels.
:(4) The atmosphere is a common resource that belongs equally to all.
:(5) Stabilizing the climate can and must be done in a way that supports vibrant economic growth and a thriving middle class.
:(6) Legislation to address climate change and accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy must be fair, transparent and built to last.
