={{anchor|id9D84B8A96159463D9B6CC20E55A1132B}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings
:(1) In communities facing environmental health hazards that have been declared a public health emergency (pursuant to section 104(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980), it is increasingly difficult for the health care facilities in those areas to recruit the specialists necessary to treat the particular health needs of the residents. As a result, these communities and their populations are medically underserved.
:(2) Since 1970, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|National Health Service Corps]] has helped communities recruit health care professionals who are committed to serving the needs of underserved populations.
