 To provide for research and education with respect to triple-negative breast cancer, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) Breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in this country.
:(2) The survival rate for breast cancer has increased to 90 percent for White women and 78 percent for African-American women.
:(3) African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer despite a lower incidence rate.
:(4) Early detection for breast cancer increases survival rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a 5-year relative survival rate of 98 percent for breast cancers that are discovered before the cancer spreads beyond the breast, compared to 23 percent for stage IV breast cancers.
:(5) Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their sources.
:(6) It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer is much higher.
:(7) Triple-negative breast cancer most commonly affects African-American women, followed by Hispanic women.
:(8) Triple-negative breast cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer which affects women under the age of 50 across all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.
:(9) African-American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer than White women.
:(10) Triple-negative breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than most other types of breast cancer.
:(11) Like other forms of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
:(12) Early-stage detection of triple-negative breast cancer is the key to survival because the tumor cells lack certain receptors, and neither hormone therapy nor drugs that target these receptors are effective against these cancers; therefore, early detection and education is vital.
:(13) Current research and available data do not provide adequate information on—
::(A) the rates of prevalence and incidence of triple-negative breast cancer in African-American, Hispanic, and other minority women;
::(B) he costs associated with treating triple-negative breast cancer; and
::(C) the methods by which triple-negative breast cancer may be prevented or cured in these women.
