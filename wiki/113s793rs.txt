=Sec. 4. Sense of Congress=

:(3) the Summit of the Americas institution and process embodies a valuable complement to regional dialogue and cooperation;

:(5) the OAS General Assembly and the Summit of the Americas events should be combined geographically and chronologically in the years in which they coincide;

:(10) any new mandates should include, in addition to the analysis described in paragraph (9), an identification of the source of funding to be used to implement the mandate;
:(11) the [[w:|OAS]] would benefit from enhanced coordination between the [[w:|OAS]] and the [[w:Inter-American Development Bank|Inter-American Development Bank]] on issues that relate to economic development;
:(12) the [[w:|OAS]] would benefit from standard reporting requirements for each project and grant agreement; and
