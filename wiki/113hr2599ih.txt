=Sec. 3. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) According to the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS), 2,239,800 persons were incarcerated in State or Federal prisons or local jails in the United States as of the end of 2011. Additionally, one in every 34 United States residents was on probation, in jail or prison, or on parole. During 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confined an additional 642,000 people. DHS held 429,000 of them in immigration detention facilities.
:(2) In 2010, 60 percent of incarcerated persons were racial or ethnic minorities. In 2011, African-Americans males ages 18 to 19 were imprisoned at more than 9 times the rate of their White counterparts. African-American men are incarcerated at a rate more than 6 times that of White males, and 2.6 times that of Hispanic males, despite similar rates of criminal activity.
:(3) There is a disproportionately high rate of HIV/AIDS among incarcerated persons, especially among minorities. Rates of HIV diagnoses among persons tested in prisons in 2004 were higher in African-Americans and Hispanics than Whites. Approximately 1 in 7 people living with HIV will pass through the prison system each year.
:(4) In 2010, the AIDS-related death rate among prisoners was more than 4 times higher among African-Americans compared to Whites.
:(5) Studies suggest that other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, genital herpes, viral hepatitis, and human papillomavirus, also exist at a higher rate among incarcerated persons than in the general population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 16 percent to 41 percent of incarcerated persons have been infected with hepatitis C (compared to 1 percent to 1.5 percent of the general population), and 12 percent to 35 percent of incarcerated persons are chronically infected with hepatitis C.
:(6) Many correctional facilities in the United States do not provide comprehensive testing and treatment programs to reduce the spread of STIs. According to BJS surveys from 2005, only 996 of the 1,821 Federal and State correctional facilities (i.e., 54.7 percent) provided HIV/AIDS counseling programs.
:(7) Individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid prior to incarceration, including those who are pending disposition and have not had a trial yet, face a suspension of their benefits upon incarceration, and in some States a termination of their Medicaid eligibility. The Federal Government encourages States to automatically re-enroll incarcerated persons on Medicaid upon their release from a correctional facility, unless the State reaches a determination that the individual is no longer eligible for reasons other than their prior incarceration.
:(8) Formerly incarcerated individuals who are newly released from correctional facilities often face delays in the resumption of their Medicaid benefits which may exacerbate any health issues which they face.
:(9) Incarcerated individuals living with HIV/AIDS who are eligible for Medicaid would benefit from prompt and automatic enrollment upon their release in order to ensure their continued ability to access health services, including antiretroviral treatment.
:(10) Correctional facilities lack a uniform system of STI testing and reporting. Establishing a uniform data collection system would assist in developing and targeting counseling and treatment programs for incarcerated persons and can help reduce the spread of STIs.
:(11) Although Congress has acted to reduce the spread of sexual violence in correctional facilities by enacting the National Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003, BJS reported that approximately 4.4 percent of incarcerated persons in prisons and 3.1 percent of persons in jail reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another incarcerated person or correctional facility staff in the previous year.
:(12) According to CDC, incarcerated persons do engage in sexual intercourse. The CDC finds that correct and consistent male or female condom use effectively reduces the risk of HIV and STI transmission and recommends HIV education and counseling in prisons.
:(13) Despite the effectiveness of condoms in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS and STIs, the [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bureau of Prisons]] does not recommend their use in correctional facilities.
:(14) The distribution of condoms in correctional facilities is currently legal in certain parts of the United States and the world. The States of Vermont and Mississippi and the District of Columbia allow condom distribution programs in their correctional facilities. The cities of New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia also allow condom distribution in their correctional facilities. However, these States and cities operate less than 1 percent of all correctional facilities.
:(15) The American Public Health Association, National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), Human Rights Watch, the United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, UNAIDS, and the World Health Organization have endorsed the effectiveness of condom distribution programs in correctional facilities. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law further recognizes that the lack of condoms exacerbates transmission risk.

=Sec. 4. Authority to allow community organizations to provide STI counseling, STI prevention education, and sexual barrier protection devices in Federal correctional facilities=



==(a) Directive to Attorney General– ==

Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall direct the [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bureau of Prisons]] to allow community organizations to distribute sexual barrier protection devices and to engage in STI counseling and STI prevention education in Federal correctional facilities.
