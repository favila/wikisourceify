{{Center|A BILL}}

To prevent and reduce the use of physical restraint and seclusion in schools, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Keeping All Students Safe Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Physical restraint and seclusion have resulted in physical injury, psychological trauma, and death to children in public and private schools. National research shows students have been subjected to physical restraint and seclusion in schools as a means of discipline, to force compliance, or as a substitute for appropriate educational support.
:(2) Behavioral interventions for children must promote the right of all children to be treated with dignity. All children have the right to be free from physical or mental abuse, aversive behavioral interventions that compromise health and safety, and any physical restraint or seclusion imposed solely for purposes of discipline or convenience.
:(3) Safe, effective, evidence-based strategies are available to support children who display challenging behaviors in school settings. Staff training focused on the dangers of physical restraint and seclusion as well as training in evidence-based positive behavior supports, de-escalation techniques, and physical restraint and seclusion prevention, can reduce the incidence of injury, trauma, and death.
:(4) School personnel have the right to work in a safe environment and should be provided training and support to prevent injury and trauma to themselves and others.
:(5) Despite the widely recognized risks of physical restraint and seclusion, a substantial disparity exists among many States and localities with regard to the protection and oversight of the rights of children and school personnel to a safe learning environment.
:(6) Children are subjected to physical restraint and seclusion at higher rates than adults. Physical restraint which restricts breathing or causes other body trauma, as well as seclusion in the absence of continuous face-to-face monitoring, have resulted in the deaths of children in schools.
:(7) Children are protected from inappropriate physical restraint and seclusion in other settings, such as hospitals, health facilities, and non-medical community-based facilities. Similar protections are needed in schools, yet such protections must acknowledge the differences of the school environment.
:(8) Research confirms that physical restraint and seclusion are not therapeutic, nor are these practices effective means to calm or teach children, and may have an opposite effect while simultaneously decreasing a child’s ability to learn.
:(9) The effective implementation of school-wide positive behavior supports is linked to greater academic achievement, significantly fewer disciplinary problems, increased instruction time, and staff perception of a safer teaching environment.

=Sec. 3. Purposes=

:(5) assist States, local educational agencies, and schools in—
::(A) establishing policies and procedures to keep all students, including students with the most complex and intensive behavioral needs, and school personnel safe;
::(B) providing school personnel with the necessary tools, training, and support to ensure the safety of all students and school personnel;
