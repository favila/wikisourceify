{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Congratulating the Newport Jazz Festival on its 60th anniversary.    Whereas, in 1954, the first Newport Jazz Festival featured icons of American jazz such as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Dizzie Gillespie;   Whereas the Newport Jazz Festival has provided some of the most memorable moments in jazz history, including the Duke Ellington Orchestra's 1956 performance of“Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue”, featuring a 27-chorus saxophone solo by Paul Gonsalves;   Whereas the ongoing mission of the Newport Jazz Festival is to celebrate jazz music and to make the case for its relevance;   Whereas the Newport Jazz Festival has become a world-renowned event featuring established and emerging artists and bringing together music lovers, musicians, academics, and critics;   Whereas for the past 60 years, the Newport Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk Festival have made a difference in the cultural life of the people of the United States and have provided a soundtrack of freedom for generations; and   Whereas, from August 1, 2014, through August 3, 2014, thousands of people will come together in Newport, Rhode Island, to celebrate the 60th Newport Jazz Festival: Now, therefore, be it
