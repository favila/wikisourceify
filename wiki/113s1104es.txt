 To measure the progress of recovery and development efforts in Haiti following the earthquake of January 12, 2010, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an estimated 220,000 people dead, including 103 United States citizens, 101 [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]personnel, and nearly 18 percent of the nation’s civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 115,000 homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 people displaced.
:(2) According to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the Government of Haiti, with technical assistance from the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]], the [[w:International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|World Bank]], the [[w:Inter-American Development Bank|Inter-American Development Bank]], the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the European Commission, an estimated 15 percent of the population was directly affected by the disaster and related damages and economic losses totaled $7,804,000,000.
:(3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti had some of the lowest socioeconomic indicators and the second highest rate of income disparity in the world, conditions that have further complicated post-earthquake recovery efforts and, according to the [[w:International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|World Bank]], have significantly reduced the prospects of addressing poverty reduction through economic growth.
:(4) According to the World Food Programme, more than 6,700,000 people in Haiti (out of a population of about 10,000,000) are considered food insecure.
:(5) In October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of cholera in Haiti resulted in over 500,000 reported cases and over 8,000 deaths to date, further straining the capacity of Haiti’s public health sector and increasing the urgency of resettlement and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) efforts.
:(6) The international community, led by the United States and the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]], mounted an unprecedented humanitarian response in Haiti, with donors pledging approximately $10,400,000,000 for humanitarian relief and recovery efforts, including debt relief, supplemented by $3,100,000,000 in private charitable contributions, of which approximately $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed and an additional $3,800,000,000 has been committed as of September 30, 2013.
:(7) The emergency response of the men and women of the United States Government, led by the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development (USAID)]]and the [[w:United States Southern Command|United States Southern Command]], as well as of cities, towns, individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United States, was particularly swift and resolute.
:(8) Since 2010, a total of $1,300,000,000 in United States assistance has been allocated for humanitarian relief and $2,300,000,000 has been allocated for recovery, reconstruction, and development assistance in Haiti, including $1,140,000,000 in emergency appropriations and $95,000,000 that has been obligated specifically to respond to the cholera epidemic.
:(9) Of the $3,600,000,000 in United States assistance allocated for Haiti, $651,000,000 was apportioned to [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]to support an ambitious recovery plan, including the construction of a power plant to provide electricity for the new Caracol Industrial Park (CIP) in northern Haiti, a new port near the CIP, and permanent housing in new settlements in the Port-au-Prince, St-Marc, and Cap-Haïtien areas.
:(10) According to a recent report of the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]], as of June 30, 2013, [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]had disbursed 31 percent of its reconstruction funds in Haiti, the port project was 2 years behind schedule and [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]funding will be insufficient to cover a majority of the projected costs, the housing project has been reduced by 80 percent, and the sustainability of the power plant, the port, and the housing projects were all at risk.
:(11)   [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]]further found that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]has not been provided with sufficient information to ensure that it is able to conduct effective oversight at a time when most funding remains to be disbursed, and specifically recommends that a periodic reporting mechanism be instituted to fill this information gap.
:(12) Donors have encountered significant challenges in implementing recovery programs, and nearly 4 years after the earthquake, an estimated 171,974 people remain displaced in camps, unemployment remains high, corruption is rampant, land rights remain elusive, allegations of wage violations are widespread, the business climate is unfavorable, and government capacity remains weak.
:(13) For Haiti to achieve stability and long term economic growth, donor assistance will have to be carefully coordinated with a commitment by the Government of Haiti to transparency, a market economy, rule of law, and democracy.
:(14) The legal environment in Haiti remains a challenge to achieving the goals supported by the international community.
