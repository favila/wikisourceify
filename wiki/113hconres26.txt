:(2) recognizes that Sergeant Peralta’s courageous and selfless actions in combat saved the lives of his fellow Marines;
:(3) concurs with the [[w:United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and the [[w:United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] that Sergeant Peralta’s actions are in the spirit and tradition of the Medal of Honor;
:(4) maintains that, consistent with previous Medal of Honor awards, the eyewitness accounts confirm that Sergeant Peralta deliberately pulled the grenade into his body and the eyewitness accounts should be the leading and deciding factor in evaluating Sergeant Peralta’s Medal of Honor nomination; and
