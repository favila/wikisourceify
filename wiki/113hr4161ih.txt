{{Center|A BILL}}

 To encourage and further research on the engagement of underrepresented youth in the STEM fields.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   21st Century STEM for Underrepresented Students Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. STEM for underrepresented students=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:National Science Foundation|Director of the National Science Foundation]]shall establish a program to provide grants on a merit-reviewed, competitive basis for research on programming that engages underrepresented students in grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM in order to prepare these groups to pursue undergraduate and graduate degrees or careers in STEM.

==(b) Use of funds– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Grants awarded under this section shall be used toward research to advance the engagement of underrepresented students grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM through providing before-school, after-school, out-of-school, or summer activities, including programs (if applicable to the target population) provided in a single-gender environment, that are designed to encourage interest, engagement, and skills development of underrepresented students in STEM. Such research shall be conducted in learning environments that actively provide programming to underrepresented students in grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM.

===(2) Permitted activities– ===

Such activities may include—
:(A) the provision of programming described in subsection (a) for the purpose of research;
:(B) the use of a variety of engagement methods including cooperative and hands-on learning;
:(C) exposure of underrepresented youth to role models in the fields of STEM and near-peer mentors;
:(D) training of informal learning educators and youth-serving professionals using evidence-based methods consistent with the target student population being served;
:(E) education of students on the relevance and significance of STEM careers, provision of academic advice and assistance, and activities designed to help students make real-world connections to STEM content activities;
:(F) the attendance of underrepresented youth at events, competitions, and academic programs to provide content expertise and encourage career exposure in STEM;
:(G) activities designed to engage parents of underrepresented youth;
:(H) innovative strategies to engage underrepresented youth, such as using leadership skill outcome measures to encourage youth with the confidence to pursue STEM coursework and academic study;
:(I) coordination with STEM-rich environments, including other nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations, classroom and out-of-classroom settings, institutions of higher education, vocational facilities, corporations, museums, or science centers; and
:(J) the acquisition of instructional materials or technology-based tools to conduct applicable grant activity.

==(c) Application– ==

An applicant seeking funding under the section shall submit an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as may be required. The application shall include, at a minimum, the following:
:(1) A description of the target audience to be served by the program, including an explanation and justification for why the target group ought to be considered as underrepresented students in one or more of the STEM fields.
:(2) A description of the process for recruitment and selection of students.
:(3) A description of how such research activity may inform programming that engages underrepresented students in grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM.
:(4) A description of how such research activity may inform programming that promotes student academic achievement in STEM.
:(5) An evaluation plan that includes, at a minimum, the use of outcome-oriented measures to determine the impact and efficacy of programming being researched.

==(d) Awards– ==

In awarding grants under this section, the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall give priority to applicants which, for the purpose of grant activity, include or partner with a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that has extensive experience and expertise in increasing the participation of underrepresented students in STEM.

==(e) Evaluations– ==

Each applicant that receives funds under this section shall provide, at the conclusion of every year during which the funds are received, an evaluation in a form prescribed by the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]. This evaluation shall include both formative and summative evaluation.

==(f) Accountability and dissemination– ==



===(1) Evaluation required– ===

Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall evaluate the program established under this section. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of the program, such evaluation shall—
:(A) use a common set of benchmarks and assessment tools to identify best practices and materials developed or demonstrated by the research; and
:(B) to the extent practicable, combine the research resulting from the grant activity with the current research on serving underrepresented students in grades kindergarten through 8.

===(2) Report on evaluations– ===

Not later than 180 days after the completion of the evaluation under paragraph (1) , the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and make widely available to the public a report that includes—
:(A) the results of the evaluation; and
:(B) any recommendations for administrative and legislative action that could optimize the effectiveness of the program.

==(g) Coordination– ==

In carrying out this section, the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director]]shall consult, cooperate, and coordinate, to enhance program effectiveness and to avoid duplication, with the programs and policies of other relevant Federal agencies.
