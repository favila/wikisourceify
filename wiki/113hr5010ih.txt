{{Center|A BILL}}

 To provide greater clarity in the regulation of electronic nicotine delivery systems, including electronic cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pipes, and hookahs, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “   Stop Selling and Marketing to Our Kids E–Cigarettes Act   ”or the“  SMOKE Act  ”.  

=Sec. 2. Findings; Sense of Congress=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) According to the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]], because electronic cigarettes have not been fully studied, consumers currently do not know—
::(A) the potential risks of electronic cigarettes when used as intended;
::(B) how much nicotine or other potentially harmful chemicals are being inhaled during use; or
::(C) if there are any benefits associated with using these products.
:(2) Use of electronic cigarettes has risen in youth according to a study by the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]that was released in September 2013, which found that in one year, from 2011 to 2012, the percentage of middle and high school students who had ever used electronic cigarettes more than doubled.
:(3) Electronic cigarette use may lead children to become addicted to nicotine and could be a gateway to various tobacco products.
:(4) Additionally, according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], 1 in 5 middle school students who reported ever using electronic cigarettes had never tried conventional cigarettes.
:(5) Marketing of electronic cigarettes to youth is occurring in the form of advertising using cartoons and sponsorships of events popular with youth such as concerts and sporting events.
:(6) According to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Poison Control Centers reported rapid increase in electronic cigarette-related exposures, of which 51.1 percent were among young children. Electronic cigarette exposure calls per month increased from one in September 2010 to 215 in February 2014.
:(7) Due to the lack of long-term studies, we do not know the viability of claims that electronic cigarettes help to lessen dependence on regular cigarettes.
:(8) According to a paper entitled“E–Cigarettes: A Scientific Review”published in the American Heart Association’s peer-reviewed journal Circulation, electronic cigarettes contain particles small enough to get into the lungs and then cross into the systemic circulation just like cigarettes. Therefore, electronic cigarettes do not only produce“water vapor”as is claimed in the marketing of these products. Furthermore, the particle size distribution and number of particles delivered by electronic cigarettes are similar to those contained in conventional cigarettes. There is already strong evidence that frequent low or short-term levels of exposure to these types of particles from tobacco smoke or air pollution can contribute to health problems such as the increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and death.
:(9) The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes may be toxic if ingested or absorbed through the skin at relatively low quantities. The lack of childproof containers makes this even more of a safety risk for children.

==(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]—
::(A) has been authorized to regulate the sale, labeling, packaging, marketing, and advertising of electronic nicotine delivery systems and e-liquids since the enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act on June 22, 2009; and
::(B) should exercise this authority; and
:(2) the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]]should prohibit the advertising, promoting, and marketing in commerce of electronic nicotine delivery systems and e-liquids to children as an unfair or deceptive act or practice, in order to protect the health of the youth of the United States.
