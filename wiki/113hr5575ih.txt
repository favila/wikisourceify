{{Center|A BILL}}

 To direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish a program to provide grants to carry out projects to reduce railway noise levels that adversely impact schools located in urbanized areas, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Peaceful Learning Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Definitions=



==(a) In general– ==

Except as otherwise specifically provided, in this Act the definitions in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/5302  section 5302of title 49, United States Code], shall apply.

==(b) Additional definitions– ==

In this Act, the following additional definitions apply:

===(1) Local educational agency– ===

The term local educational agency has the meaning given that term in  section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/7801 20 U.S.C. 7801] ).

===(2) Rail operator– ===

The term rail operator means an owner or operator of a fixed rail public transportation facility.

===(3) Railway noise– ===

The term railway noise means noise caused by a fixed rail public transportation facility.

===(4) School– ===

The term school means an elementary school or a secondary school (as those terms are defined in  section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/7801 20 U.S.C. 7801] )). 

=Sec. 3. Railway noise study=



==(a) In General– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]]shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on railway noise in the United States.

==(b) Contents of Study– ==

In conducting the study, the National Academy of Sciences shall examine—
:(1) the threshold of railway noise at which health begins to be affected;
:(2) the effectiveness of noise abatement programs for railway noise on the property of a school;
:(3) the impacts of railway noise on schools; and
:(4) the noise assessment practices of the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]and whether such practices fairly and accurately reflect the burden of noise on communities.

==(c) Report– ==

Not later than 12 months after the date of the agreement entered into under subsection (a), the National Academy of Sciences shall transmit to the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]a report on the results of the study. Upon receipt of the report, the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]shall transmit a copy of the report to the appropriate committees of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]. 

=Sec. 4. Noise measurement and exposure systems=

Not later than 12 months after the date of submission of the report under section 3 , in consultation with the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]and Government, State, and interstate agencies that the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]]considers appropriate, the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]shall by regulation—
:(1) establish a single system of measuring railway noise that—
::(A) has a highly reliable relationship between projected railway noise exposure and surveyed reactions of individuals to noise; and
::(B) is applied uniformly in measuring railway noise near urbanized areas;
:(2) establish a single system for determining the exposure of individuals to railway noise in urbanized areas, including noise intensity, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence; and
:(3) based on the findings of the report required under section 3 , determine minimum standards for railway noise levels on the property of a school located in an urbanized area. 

=Sec. 5. Noise exposure maps=



==(a) Submission and Preparation– ==

Not later than 12 months after the date of issuance of regulations under section 4 , each rail operator shall submit to the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]]a noise exposure map showing any areas of nonconforming railway noise levels (based on the standards developed under section 4 ) that—
:(1) adversely impact a school located in an urbanized area; and
:(2) are caused by operations of the rail operator.

==(b) Revised Maps– ==

If a change in the rail operations of a rail operator described in subsection (a) establishes a substantial new nonconforming noise level on the property of a school located in an urbanized area, or significantly reduces nonconforming noise levels on the property of such a school, that is not reflected in the noise exposure map, the rail operator shall submit a revised noise exposure map to the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]showing the new nonconforming noise levels or noise level reduction. 

=Sec. 6. Noise compatibility programs=



==(a) Program submission– ==

A rail operator that submitted a noise exposure map under section 5 may submit a noise compatibility program to the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]]after—
:(1) consulting with public agencies and planning authorities in the area covered by the map; and
:(2) notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.

==(b) Contents of program– ==

A program submitted under subsection (a) shall state the measures the rail operator has taken or proposes to take to reduce existing nonconforming noise levels on the property of a school and prevent creating additional nonconforming noise levels in the area covered by the map. The measures may include constructing barriers or acoustical shielding and soundproofing of schools subject to a nonconforming noise level.

==(c) Approvals– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]shall approve or disapprove a program submitted under subsection (a) of this section not later than 180 days after receiving it. The [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]shall approve the program if the program—
:(1) is reasonably consistent with achieving the goal of reducing nonconforming noise levels on the property of a school and preventing the introduction of additional nonconforming noise levels on the property of a school; and
:(2) provides for necessary revisions because of a revised map submitted under section 5 .

==(d) Grants– ==

The [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]may incur obligations to make grants from amounts available under section 8 to carry out a project under a part of a noise compatibility program approved under subsection (c). A grant may be made to a rail operator submitting the program to carry out the program directly or in cooperation with—
:(1) a local educational agency of a school that is subject to nonconforming noise levels; or
:(2) a unit of local government in the area surrounding the school that has nonconforming noise levels.

==(e) Federal share– ==

The Federal share of a project for which a grant is made under subsection (d) is 80 percent of the cost of the project. 

=Sec. 7. Nonadmissibility of noise exposure map and related information as evidence=

No part of a noise exposure map or related information described in section 5 that is submitted to, or prepared by, the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]]and no part of a list of land uses the [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary]]identifies as normally compatible with various exposures of individuals to noise may be admitted into evidence or used for any other purpose in a civil action asking for relief for noise resulting from the operation of a fixed rail public transportation facility. 

=Sec. 8. Authorization of appropriations=

 There are authorized to be appropriatedfrom the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fundunder[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/5338  section 5338of title 49, United States Code], such funds as may be necessary to carry out this Act  .
