{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to allow all eligible voters to vote by mail in Federal elections.

={{anchor|H287B1C8A1A494EB6B31CE4D9F56E041E}}Section 1. Short Title=

This Act may be cited as the“Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|H6CB015936ABC43BEACCBF1159977396B}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the United States because voters in some States have the universal right to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.
:(2) Many voters often have work, family, or other commitments that make getting to polls on the date of an election difficult or impossible. Under current State laws, many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail.
:(3) 29 States and the District of Columbia currently allow universal absentee voting (also known as“no-excuse”absentee voting), which permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason for the request, and no State which has implemented no-excuse absentee voting has switched back.
:(4) Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum process in many States.
:(5) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can lead to increased voter participation.
:(6) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at the polls.
:(7) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an alternative to going to the polls. Voting by mail has become increasingly popular with voters who want to be certain that they are able to vote no matter what comes up on Election Day.
:(8) No evidence exists suggesting the potential for fraud in absentee balloting is greater than the potential for fraud by any other method of voting.
:(9) Many of the reasons which voters in many States are required to provide in order to vote by mail require the revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, or religious activities, which violate voters’ privacy while doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.
:(10) State laws which require voters to obtain a notary signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to voters without increasing security.
