				subsection (a) for the following care:

				primary care of the veteran.

				to be geographically inaccessible for purposes of paragraph (1) in the case of
				a veteran whose residence meets any of the following criteria:
:::(A) The residence is in a county with a
				population density of less than 7.0 people per square mile and is more than 75
				miles from the nearest [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] health care facility.

				distance in miles shall be determined on the basis of the most convenient
				highway route that is available to the veteran, as determined by the
