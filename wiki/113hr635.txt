(e)
(1)
In the case of a veteran
				for whom [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] facilities are geographically inaccessible (as provided in
				paragraph (2)
), the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] shall use the contract authority provided in
				subsection (a)
 for the following care:
(A)
Primary care.

(B)
Acute or chronic symptom
				management.

(C)
Nontherapeutic medical
				services.

(D)
Other medical services as determined
				appropriate by the director of the appropriate geographic service region of the
				[[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]], after consultation with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] physician responsible for
				primary care of the veteran.


(2)

                [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] facilities shall be deemed
				to be geographically inaccessible for purposes of paragraph (1)
 in the case of
				a veteran whose residence meets any of the following criteria:
(A)
The residence is in a county with a
				population density of less than 7.0 people per square mile and is more than 75
				miles from the nearest [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] health care facility.

(B)
The residence is in a county with a
				population density of more than 7.0 and less than 8.0 people per square mile
				and is more than 100 miles from the nearest Department health care
				facility.

				paragraph (1)

				the individual veteran.

(4)
For purposes of paragraph (2)
, a
				distance in miles shall be determined on the basis of the most convenient
				highway route that is available to the veteran, as determined by the
