<blockquote>
:(i) 
::(1) The [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a prefiled project not later than 12 months after receiving a complete application that is ready to be processed, as defined by the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] by regulation.
::(2) The agency responsible for issuing any license, permit, or approval required under Federal law in connection with a prefiled project for which a certificate of public convenience and necessity is sought under this Act shall approve or deny the issuance of the license, permit, or approval not later than 90 days after the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] issues its final environmental document relating to the project.
::(3) The [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] may extend the time period under paragraph (2)by 30 days if an agency demonstrates that it cannot otherwise complete the process required to approve or deny the license, permit, or approval, and therefor will be compelled to deny the license, permit, or approval. In granting an extension under this paragraph, the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] may offer technical assistance to the agency as necessary to address conditions preventing the completion of the review of the application for the license, permit, or approval.
::(4) If an agency described in paragraph (2)does not approve or deny the issuance of the license, permit, or approval within the time period specified under paragraph (2)or (3), as applicable, such license, permit, or approval shall take effect upon the expiration of 30 days after the end of such period. The [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] shall incorporate into the terms of such license, permit, or approval any conditions proffered by the agency described in paragraph (2)that the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] does not find are inconsistent with the final environmental document.
::(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term “prefiled project” means a project for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a natural gas pipeline with respect to which a prefiling docket number has been assigned by the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] pursuant to a prefiling process established by the [[w:Federal Energy Regulatory Commission|Commission]] for the purpose of facilitating the formal application process for obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity..
