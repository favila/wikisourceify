{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for a national program to conduct and support activities toward the goal of significantly reducing the number of cases of overweight and obesity among individuals in the United States.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Promoting Healthier Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise Act   ”or the“ LIFE Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds as follows:
:(1) Currently, 64.5 percent of adults in the United States, age 20 years and older, are overweight and 72 million (more than one-third of the adult population in the United States) are obese.
:(2) Data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys show that among adults who are 20 to 74 years of age the prevalence of obesity increased from 15.0 percent in the 1976–1980 survey to 34.9 percent in the 2011–2012 survey.
:(3) In 2011 and 2012, of children and adolescents 2 to 19 years of age more than 12,500,000 (or 17 percent) were overweight, and of adults more than 66,000,000 (or 34.9 percent) were obese. Almost 6 percent of adults were extremely obese.
:(4) The percentage of children who are obese has more than doubled, and among adolescents the percentage has more than tripled, since 1980 the obesity rate for adolescents increased from 5 percent to 21 percent.
:(5) More than1/3of adults in the United States do not get enough physical activity and national data have shown an increase in the calorie consumption of adults.
:(6) The rising rates of obesity portend greater disease and health conditions including hypertension, high total cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, and respiratory problems, and some cancers, such as endometrial, breast, and colon cancer.
:(7) Many underlying factors have been linked to the increase in obesity, such as increasing portion sizes, eating out more often, increased consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks, increasing television, computer, and electronic gaming time, changing labor markets, and fear of crime, which prevents outdoor exercise.
:(8) Chronic diseases account for 1.7 million, or 70 percent, of all deaths in the United States each year. Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting a healthy lifestyle such as eating nutritious foods and engaging in physical activity, can prevent or control the devastating effects of these diseases. Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable.
:(9) In 2008, overall medical costs related to obesity for United States adults were estimated to be as high as $147 billion. People who were obese had medical costs that were on average $1,429 higher than the cost for people of normal body weight.
