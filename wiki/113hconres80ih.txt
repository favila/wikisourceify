{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of January 2014 as“National Blood Donor Month”.    Whereas America's Blood Centers, AABB, and the American Red Cross unite to designate January 2014 as“National Blood Donor Month”;   Whereas donating 1 unit of blood saves as many as 3 lives;   Whereas blood donors are an integral part of the health system and national public health preparedness initiatives in the United States;   Whereas blood and blood products are critical national resources and vital public health assets that must be readily available at all times;   Whereas every 2 seconds, a person in the United States needs blood for lifesaving treatment in an emergency or a disaster, a routine surgery, a blood transfusion to help treat a serious disease like cancer, or an organ or bone marrow transplant;   Whereas 1 in 7 patients who enter a hospital in the United States needs blood;   Whereas more than 20,000,000 blood components are used in transfusions every year in the United States;   Whereas over 41,000 units of blood are needed each day in the United States to maintain a safe and adequate blood supply;   Whereas 9,200,000 donors give blood each year in the United States;   Whereas approximately 38 percent of the United States population is eligible to give blood, but less than 10 percent of the eligible population donates blood on an annual basis;   Whereas blood transfusions require generous and altruistic volunteer donors;   Whereas it is vital that the blood donation policies, including donor deferral policies, in the United States keep pace with medical science to ensure that the United States has a robust, eligible population of donors to maintain a safe and adequate blood supply; and   Whereas America's Blood Centers, AABB, and the American Red Cross support and perform critical services collecting, processing, and distributing lifesaving blood and blood products to hospitals and health providers, and are instrumental in ensuring the safety of the blood supply and promoting the need for blood donations: Now, therefore, be it
