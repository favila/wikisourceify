{{Center|A BILL}}

 To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to carry out programs and activities that connect the people of the United States, especially children, youth, and families, with the outdoors.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Healthy Kids Outdoors Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) Children today are spending less time outdoors than any generation in human history, as evidenced by studies that show children enjoy half as much time outdoors today as they did just 20 years ago, while spending more than 71/2hours every day in front of electronic media.
:(2) The health of our children is at risk as evidenced by the growing obesity crisis where, in the past 30 years, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents, costing the economy of the United States billions of dollars each year.
:(3) Our military readiness is declining as nearly 1 in 4 applicants to the military is rejected for being overweight or obese, which is the most common reason for medical disqualification.
:(4) Research has shown that military children and families are facing increased stress and mental strain and challenges due to multiple, extended deployments. Military family service organizations have developed programs that connect military children and families with positive, meaningful outdoor experiences that benefit mental and physical health, but they lack sufficient resources to meet increasing demand.
:(5) In addition to the negative economic impact of childhood obesity, the outdoor retail industry, many local tourist destinations or“gateway communities”, and State fish and wildlife agencies rely on revenue generated when individuals spend time outdoors to create jobs in local communities.
:(6) Over the past several years, urbanization, changing land use patterns, increasing road traffic, and inadequate solutions to addressing these challenges in the built environment have combined to make it more difficult for many people of the United States to walk or bike to schools, parks, and play areas or experience the natural environment in general.
:(7) Spending time in green spaces outside the home, including public lands, parks, play areas, and gardens, can increase concentration, inhibition of initial impulses, and self-discipline and has been shown to reduce stress and mental fatigue. In one study, children who were exposed to greener environments in a public housing area demonstrated less aggression, violence, and stress.
:(8) Visitation to our Nation’s public lands has declined or remained flat in recent years, and yet, connecting with nature and the great outdoors in our communities is critical to fostering the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts who will visit, appreciate, and become stewards of our Nation’s public lands.
:(9) Spending time outdoors in nature is beneficial to our children’s physical, mental, and emotional health and has been proven to decrease symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, stimulate brain development, improve motor skills, result in better sleep, reduce stress, increase creativity, improve mood, and reduce children’s risk of developing myopia.
:(10) Children who spend time playing outside are more likely to take risks, seek out adventure, develop self-confidence, and respect the value of nature. A direct childhood experience with nature before the age of 11 promotes a long-term connection to nature.
:(11) Conservation education and outdoor recreation experiences such as camping, hiking, boating, hunting, fishing, archery, recreational shooting, wildlife watching, and others are critical to engaging young people in the outdoors.
:(12) As children become more disconnected from the natural world, the hunting and angling conservation legacy of America is at risk.
:(13) Hunters and anglers play a critical role in reconnecting young people with nature, protecting our natural resources, and fostering a lifelong understanding of the value of conserving the natural world.
:(14) Research demonstrates that hunters who become engaged in hunting as children are among the most active and interested hunters as adults. The vast majority of hunters report they were introduced to hunting between the ages of 10 and 12, and the overwhelming majority of children are introduced to hunting by an adult.
:(15) Parks and recreation, youth-serving, service-learning, conservation, health, education, and built-environment organizations, facilities, and personnel provide critical resources and infrastructure for connecting children and families with nature.
:(16) It takes many dedicated men and women to work to preserve, protect, enhance, and restore America’s natural resources, and with an aging workforce in the natural resource professions, it is critical for the next generation to have an appreciation for nature and be ready to take over these responsibilities.
:(17) Place-based service-learning opportunities use our lands and waters as the context for learning by engaging students in the process of exploration, action, and reflection. Physical activity outdoors connected with meaningful community service to solve real-world problems, such as removing invasive plants or removing trash from a streambed, strengthens communities by engaging youth as citizen stewards.
:(18) States nationwide and their community-based partners have some notable programs that connect children and families with nature; however, most States lack sufficient resources and a comprehensive strategy to effectively engage State agencies across multiple fields.
:(19) States need to engage in cross-sector agency and nonprofit collaboration that involves public health and wellness, parks and recreation, transportation and city planning, and other sectors focused on connecting children and families with the outdoors to increase coordination and effective implementation of the policy tools and programs that a State can bring to bear to provide outdoor opportunities for children and families.
