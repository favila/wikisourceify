:(B) household energy use can vary substantially depending on the efficiency and characteristics of the house;
:(C) expected energy cost savings are important to the value of the house;
:(D) the current test for loan affordability used by most covered agencies, commonly known as the debt-to-income test, is inadequate because it does not take into account the expected energy cost savings for the homeowner of an energy efficient home; and
:(E) another loan limitation, commonly known as the loan-to-value test, is tied to the appraisal, which often does not adjust for efficiency features of houses.

=====(2) Purposes– =====

The purposes of this section are to—
:(A) improve the accuracy of mortgage underwriting by Federal mortgage agencies by ensuring that energy cost savings are included in the underwriting process as described below, and thus to reduce the amount of energy consumed by homes and to facilitate the creation of energy efficiency retrofit and construction jobs;
:(B) require a covered agency to include the expected energy cost savings of a homeowner as a regular expense in the tests, such as the debt-to-income test, used to determine the ability of the loan applicant to afford the cost of homeownership for all loan programs; and
:(C) require a covered agency to include the value home buyers place on the energy efficiency of a house in tests used to compare the mortgage amount to home value, taking precautions to avoid double-counting and to support safe and sound lending.

====(c) Enhanced energy efficiency underwriting criteria– ====



=====(1) In general– =====

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]]shall, in consultation with the advisory group established in subsection (f)(2) , develop and issue guidelines for a covered agency to implement enhanced loan eligibility requirements, for use when testing the ability of a loan applicant to repay a covered loan, that account for the expected energy cost savings for a loan applicant at a subject property, in the manner set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) .

=====(2) Requirements To account for energy cost savings– =====

The enhanced loan eligibility requirements under paragraph (1) shall require that, for all covered loans for which an energy efficiency report is voluntarily provided to the mortgagee by the mortgagor, the covered agency and the mortgagee shall take into consideration the estimated energy cost savings expected for the owner of the subject property in determining whether the loan applicant has sufficient income to service the mortgage debt plus other regular expenses. To the extent that a covered agency uses a test such as a debt-to-income test that includes certain regular expenses, such as hazard insurance and property taxes, the expected energy cost savings shall be included as an offset to these expenses. Energy costs to be assessed include the cost of electricity, natural gas, oil, and any other fuel regularly used to supply energy to the subject property.
