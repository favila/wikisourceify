{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants for innovative teacher retention programs.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Keep Teachers Teaching Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) The United States faces an increasing need for high-quality educators.
:(2) Approximately one-third of teachers leave the profession within 3 years of being hired because of poor working conditions, low pay, low morale, or lack of a pathway for professional advancement. In some schools, the five-year attrition rate reaches 50 percent.
:(3) Effective teacher retention programs to address this problem are already at work in local educational agencies around the country, and many more innovative programs could be advanced if additional resources were available.
:(4) Efforts to address the teacher shortage demands a national strategy to support the development and implementation of innovative teacher retention programs.
:(5) The [[w:|Department of Education]]can play an important role in facilitating the identification of the most promising teacher retention approaches and disseminating information about them to State educational agencies and local educational agencies.
