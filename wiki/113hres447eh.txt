{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Supporting the democratic and European aspirations of the people of Ukraine, and their right to choose their own future free of intimidation and fear.Whereas a democratic, prosperous, and independent Ukraine is in the national interest of the United States;Whereas the Government of Ukraine has declared integration with Europe a national priority and has made significant progress toward meeting the requirements for an Association Agreement;Whereas on November 21, 2013, following several months of intense outside pressure, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych abruptly suspended negotiations on the Association Agreement one week before it was due to be signed at the European Union’s Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania;Whereas this reversal of stated government policy precipitated demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens in Kyiv as well as in cities throughout the country;Whereas the demonstrators have been overwhelmingly peaceful and have sought to exercise their constitutional rights to freely assemble and express their opposition to President Yanukovych’s decision;Whereas the demonstrators have consistently expressed their support for democracy, human rights, greater government accountability, and the rule of law, as well as for closer relations with Europe;Whereas on November 30, 2013, police violently dispersed peaceful demonstrators in Kyiv’s Independence Square, resulting in many injuries and the arrest of several dozen individuals;Whereas on December 11, 2013, police raided 3 opposition media outlets and the headquarters of an opposition party;Whereas on December 11, 2013, despite President Yanukovych’s statement the previous day that he would engage in talks with the opposition, police attempted to forcibly evict peaceful protesters from central locations in Kyiv;Whereas several journalists, including from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and civic activists supporting the demonstrators have been brutally attacked;Whereas on January 16, 2014, the Ukrainian parliament passed, and President Yanukovych signed, legislation which severely limits the right of peaceful protest, constrains freedom of speech and the independent media, and unduly restricts civil society organizations;Whereas the passage of these undemocratic measures and President Yanukovych’s refusal to engage in substantive dialogue with opposition leaders precipitated several days of violence and resulted in several deaths and hundreds of injuries, as well as numerous allegations of police brutality; andWhereas in the face of spreading demonstrations, Ukrainian Government representatives and opposition leaders have entered into negotiations which on January 28, 2014, resulted in the resignation of the Prime Minister and his cabinet and the repeal of most of the anti-democratic laws from January 16, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
