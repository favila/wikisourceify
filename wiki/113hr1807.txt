{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a grant program to assist retail power providers with the establishment and operation of energy conservation programs using targeted residential tree-planting, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H6F95FFA7881040D1B541D98632401EBE}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“The Residential Energy and Economic Savings Act”or the“TREES Act”.

={{anchor|HC3081F8C77B1443B9F3DD0EC9EE68A4E}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the utility sector is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States today, producing approximately one-third of the country’s emissions;
:(2) heating and cooling homes accounts for nearly 60 percent of residential electricity usage in the United States;
:(3) shade trees planted in strategic locations can reduce residential cooling costs by as much as 30 percent;
:(4) strategically planted shade trees can provide significant carbon benefits both directly (sequestration by the growing tree) and indirectly (reductions in carbon emissions from electricity conservation);
:(5) trees can reduce the rate and magnitude of stormwater runoff and improve surface water quality;
:(6) trees reduce topsoil erosion, prevent harmful land pollutants contained in soil from getting into our waterways, slow down water run-off, and ensure that our groundwater supplies are continually being replenished; and
:(7) trees strategically placed on or near residential property can increase a home’s property value.

={{anchor|H77A908ECBD494451B4EF85E165B643E2}}Sec. 3. Definitions=

As used in this Act:
:(1) The term nonprofit tree-planting organization means any organization described in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// section 501(c)(3)] of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)] ), that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501 26 U.S.C. 501(a)] ), which exists, in whole or in part, to—
::(A) expand urban and residential tree cover;
::(B) distribute young trees for planting;
::(C) increase awareness of the environmental and energy-related benefits of trees;
::(D) educate the public about proper tree planting, care, and maintenance strategies; or
::(E) carry out any combination of the foregoing activities.
:(2) The term retail power provider means any entity authorized under applicable State or Federal law to generate, distribute, or provide retail electricity, natural gas, or fuel oil service.
:(3) The term Secretary means the Secretary of Energy.
:(4) The term State means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and each commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.
:(5) The term tree-siting guidelines means a comprehensive list of science-based measurements outlining the species and minimum distance required between trees planted pursuant to this Act, in addition to the minimum required distance to be maintained between such trees and—
::(A) building foundations;
::(B) air conditioning units;
::(C) driveways and walkways;
::(D) property fences;
::(E) preexisting utility infrastructure;
::(F) septic systems;
::(G) swimming pools; and
::(H) other infrastructure as determined appropriate.

={{anchor|HD4F4BFA66ED74586ACFED0CF6107EE0F}}Sec. 4. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to assist retail power providers with the establishment and operation of targeted residential tree-planting programs, for the following purposes:
:(1) Reducing the peak-load demand for electricity in residential areas during the summer months through direct shading of residential buildings provided by strategically planted trees.
:(2) Reducing wintertime demand for energy in residential areas by blocking cold winds from reaching homes, which lowers interior temperatures and drives heating demand.
:(3) Protecting air quality and public health by removing harmful pollution from the air.
:(4) Utilizing the natural photosynthetic and transpiration process of trees to lower ambient temperatures and absorb carbon dioxide, thus mitigating the effects of climate change.
:(5) Lowering electric bills for residential ratepayers by limiting electricity consumption without reducing benefits.
:(6) Relieving financial and demand pressure on retail power providers that stems from large peak-load energy demand.
:(7) Protecting water quality and public health by reducing stormwater runoff and keeping harmful pollutants from entering waterways.
:(8) Promoting community education, involvement, and stewardship of much-needed tree canopy coverage in residential communities.
