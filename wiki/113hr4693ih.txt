{{Center|A BILL}}

 To award a gold medal on behalf of the Congress to the U.S. Air Forces Escape and Evasion Society, in recognition of the ceaseless efforts of American aircrew members to escape captivity and evade capture by the enemy forces in occupied countries during our foreign wars, and the brave resistance organizations and patriotic nationals of those foreign countries who assisted them.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   U.S. Air Forces Escape and Evasion Society Recognition Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds the following:
:(1) During nearly all foreign wars, members of our Air Force have been forced to eject, crash land, or abandon their aircraft in an occupied country or territory (referred to in this Act as“downed aircrew members”).
:(2) Those downed aircrew members had to evade capture by enemy forces, oftentimes while suffering from critical injuries.
:(3) Of the downed aircrew members that were captured, many escaped from the enemy force that was holding them.
:(4) Many times, downed aircrew members were aided in evasion and escape by resistance organizations and patriotic nationals in those occupied countries.
:(5) Thousands of brave, ordinary people in the occupied countries took extraordinary risks at huge costs to help these aircrew members.
:(6) Each downed aircrew member’s story is different; however, the narrative for each member has one common thread: American aircrew members evading capture or escaping captivity with the assistance of brave people living in an occupied country.
:(7) In 1964, the U.S. Air Forces Escape and Evasion Society (AFEES) was created by the downed aircrew members who evaded capture by enemy forces during foreign wars with the assistance of resistance organizations and patriotic nationals in occupied countries.
:(8) AFEES includes downed aircrew members and people who directly aided them in escape and evasion, and has more than 600 members, including members from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.
