 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) In 1971, Congress created the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, led by Governor Raymond P. Shafer, known as the Shafer Commission.

:(3) The final report of the Shafer Commission recommended that marijuana be decriminalized.
:(4) Since the Shafer Commission, the Federal Government has expanded its War on Drugs and continued to prohibit the use of marijuana.
:(5) The District of Columbia and 18 States have legalized and regulated the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.
:(6) Since 1973, 15 States have decriminalized marijuana for personal use, in some cases based on the Shafer Commission recommendations.
:(7) Since 1973, 2 States have legalized and regulated marijuana for personal use.
:(8) Since the Shafer Commission, the Federal Government has not undertaken a similar review of its policy toward marijuana.
:(9) The Federal Government must reconcile its prohibition of marijuana with the laws of the States where marijuana is legal for some purposes and the likelihood that more States will follow in this path.
