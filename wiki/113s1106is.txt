==(4) Mortgagee– ==

The term mortgagee means—
:(A) an original lender under a covered loan or the holder of a covered loan at the time at which that mortgage transaction is consummated;
:(B) any affiliate, agent, subsidiary, successor, or assignee of an original lender under a covered loan or the holder of a covered loan at the time at which that mortgage transaction is consummated;
:(C) any servicer of a covered loan; and
:(D) any subsequent purchaser, trustee, or transferee of any covered loan issued by an original lender.

==(5) Secretary– ==

The term Secretary means the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]].

==(6) Servicer– ==

The term servicer means the person or entity responsible for the servicing of a covered loan, including the person or entity who makes or holds a covered loan if that person or entity also services the covered loan.

==(7) Servicing– ==

The term servicing has the meaning given the term in  section 6(i) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/2605 12 U.S.C. 2605(i)] ). 

=Sec. 3. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) energy costs for homeowners are a significant and increasing portion of their household budgets;
:(2) household energy use can vary substantially depending on the efficiency and characteristics of the house;
:(3) expected energy cost savings are important to the value of the house;
:(4) the current test for loan affordability used by most covered agencies, commonly known as the debt-to-income test, is inadequate because it does not take into account the expected energy cost savings for the homeowner of an energy efficient home; and
:(5) another loan limitation, commonly known as the loan-to-value test, is tied to the appraisal, which often does not adjust for efficiency features of houses.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are to—
:(1) improve the accuracy of mortgage underwriting by Federal mortgage agencies by ensuring that energy cost savings are included in the underwriting process as described below, and thus to reduce the amount of energy consumed by homes and to facilitate the creation of energy efficiency retrofit and construction jobs;
:(2) require a covered agency to include the expected energy cost savings of a homeowner as a regular expense in the tests, such as the debt-to-income test, used to determine the ability of the loan applicant to afford the cost of homeownership for all loan programs; and
:(3) require a covered agency to include the value home buyers place on the energy efficiency of a house in tests used to compare the mortgage amount to home value, taking precautions to avoid double-counting and to support safe and sound lending. 

=Sec. 4. Enhanced energy efficiency underwriting criteria=



==(a) In general– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]]shall, in consultation with the advisory group established in section 7(b) , develop and issue guidelines for a covered agency to implement enhanced loan eligibility requirements, for use when testing the ability of a loan applicant to repay a covered loan, that account for the expected energy cost savings for a loan applicant at a subject property, in the manner set forth in subsections (b) and (c) .

==(b) Requirements To account for energy cost savings– ==

The enhanced loan eligibility requirements under subsection (a) shall require that, for all covered loans for which an energy efficiency report is voluntarily provided to the mortgagee by the mortgagor, the covered agency and the mortgagee shall take into consideration the estimated energy cost savings expected for the owner of the subject property in determining whether the loan applicant has sufficient income to service the mortgage debt plus other regular expenses. To the extent that a covered agency uses a test such as a debt-to-income test that includes certain regular expenses, such as hazard insurance and property taxes, the expected energy cost savings shall be included as an offset to these expenses. Energy costs to be assessed include the cost of electricity, natural gas, oil, and any other fuel regularly used to supply energy to the subject property.

==(c) Determination of estimated energy cost savings– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The guidelines to be issued under subsection (a) shall include instructions for the covered agency to calculate estimated energy cost savings using—
:(A) the energy efficiency report;
:(B) an estimate of baseline average energy costs; and
:(C) additional sources of information as determined by the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]].

===(2) Report requirements– ===

For the purposes of paragraph (1) , an energy efficiency report shall—
:(A) estimate the expected energy cost savings specific to the subject property, based on specific information about the property;
:(B) be prepared in accordance with the guidelines to be issued under subsection (a) ; and
:(C) be prepared—
::(i) in accordance with the Residential Energy Service Network’s Home Energy Rating System (commonly known as HERS ) by an individual certified by the Residential Energy Service Network, unless the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]]finds that the use of HERS does not further the purposes of this Act; or
::(ii) by other methods approved by the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]], in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]]and the advisory group established in section 7(b) , for use under this Act, which shall include a third-party quality assurance procedure.

===(3) Use by appraiser– ===

If an energy efficiency report is used under subsection (b) , the energy efficiency report shall be provided to the appraiser to estimate the energy efficiency of the subject property and for potential adjustments for energy efficiency.

==(d) Required disclosure to consumer for a home with an energy efficiency report– ==

If an energy efficiency report is used under subsection (b) , the guidelines to be issued under subsection (a) shall require the mortgagee to—
:(1) inform the loan applicant of the expected energy costs as estimated in the energy efficiency report, in a manner and at a time as prescribed by the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]], and if practicable, in the documents delivered at the time of loan application; and
:(2) include the energy efficiency report in the documentation for the loan provided to the borrower.

==(e) Required disclosure to consumer for a home without an energy efficiency report– ==

If an energy efficiency report is not used under subsection (b) , the guidelines to be issued under subsection (a) shall require the mortgagee to inform the loan applicant in a manner and at a time as prescribed by the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]], and if practicable, in the documents delivered at the time of loan application of—
:(1) typical energy cost savings that would be possible from a cost-effective energy upgrade of a home of the size and in the region of the subject property;
:(2) the impact the typical energy cost savings would have on monthly ownership costs of a typical home;
:(3) the impact on the size of a mortgage that could be obtained if the typical energy cost savings were reflected in an energy efficiency report; and
:(4) resources for improving the energy efficiency of a home.

==(f) Limitations– ==

A covered agency shall not—
:(1) modify existing underwriting criteria or adopt new underwriting criteria that intentionally negate or reduce the impact of the requirements or resulting benefits that are set forth or otherwise derived from the enhanced loan eligibility requirements required under this section; or
:(2) impose greater buy back requirements, credit overlays, insurance requirements, including private mortgage insurance, or any other material costs, impediments, or penalties on covered loans merely because the loan uses an energy efficiency report or the enhanced loan eligibility requirements required under this section.

==(g) Applicability and implementation date– ==

Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and before December 31, 2016, the enhanced loan eligibility requirements required under this section shall be implemented by each covered agency to—
:(1) apply to any covered loan for the sale, or refinancing of any loan for the sale, of any home;
:(2) be available on any residential real property (including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives) that qualifies for a covered loan; and
:(3) provide prospective mortgagees with sufficient guidance and applicable tools to implement the required underwriting methods. 

=Sec. 5. Enhanced energy efficiency underwriting valuation guidelines=



==(a) In general– ==

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Department of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary]]shall—
:(1) in consultation with the [[w:|Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]]and the advisory group established in section 7(b) , develop and issue guidelines for a covered agency to determine the maximum permitted loan amount based on the value of the property for all covered loans made on properties with an energy efficiency report that meets the requirements of section 4(c)(2) ; and
:(2) in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]], issue guidelines for a covered agency to determine the estimated energy savings under subsection (c) for properties with an energy efficiency report.

==(b) Requirements– ==

The enhanced energy efficiency underwriting valuation guidelines required under subsection (a) shall include—
:(1) a requirement that if an energy efficiency report that meets the requirements of section 4(c)(2) is voluntarily provided to the mortgagee, such report shall be used by the mortgagee or covered agency to determine the estimated energy savings of the subject property; and
:(2) a requirement that the estimated energy savings of the subject property be added to the appraised value of the subject property by a mortgagee or covered agency for the purpose of determining the loan-to-value ratio of the subject property, unless the appraisal includes the value of the overall energy efficiency of the subject property, using methods to be established under the guidelines issued under subsection (a) .

==(c) Determination of estimated energy savings– ==



===(1) Amount of energy savings– ===

The amount of estimated energy savings shall be determined by calculating the difference between the estimated energy costs for the average comparable houses, as determined in guidelines to be issued under subsection (a) , and the estimated energy costs for the subject property based upon the energy efficiency report.

===(2) Duration of energy savings– ===

The duration of the estimated energy savings shall be based upon the estimated life of the applicable equipment, consistent with the rating system used to produce the energy efficiency report.

===(3) Present value of energy savings– ===

The present value of the future savings shall be discounted using the average interest rate on conventional 30-year mortgages, in the manner directed by guidelines issued under subsection (a) .

==(d) Ensuring consideration of energy efficient features– ==

   Section 1110 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/3339 12 U.S.C. 3339])is amended—
