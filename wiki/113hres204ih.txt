{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commending Korean American veterans of the Vietnam War for their service to the United States.    Whereas Korean veterans of the Vietnam War served honorably throughout the conflict, fighting courageously alongside the United States Armed Forces and often making the ultimate sacrifice, with many later becoming United States citizens;   Whereas the United States holds as its highest ideals freedom, democracy, and self-determination;   Whereas during the Vietnam War, more than 3,000,000 members of the United States Armed Forces fought bravely to preserve and defend these ideals with some still missing in action;   Whereas 58,193 members of the United States Armed Forces were killed, more than 300,000 were wounded, and 2,000 are missing in action;   Whereas soldiers from the Republic of Korea were sent to the Vietnam War to support the United States Armed Forces and the cause of freedom at the request of the United States;   Whereas 325,517 Korean soldiers served in Vietnam from 1964 until the last soldier left Saigon on March 23, 1973, making Korean soldiers the second largest contingent of troops sent by allies of the United States;   Whereas Korean troops fought bravely throughout the theater and were known for their dedication, tenacity, and effectiveness on the battlefield;   Whereas 5,099 Korean soldiers were killed and 10,962 Korean soldiers were injured, many in defense of United States friends and allies;   Whereas it is estimated that 20 percent of Korean veterans of the Vietnam War suffer from significant injuries including post-traumatic stress disorder, total disability, and the effects of the toxic defoliant Agent Orange; and   Whereas Korean American veterans of the Vietnam War honorably upheld the highest ideals of the United States through their dedicated service and considerable sacrifices: Now, therefore, be it
