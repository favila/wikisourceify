::(i) in which the employer has offered and the employee has chosen to receive compensatory time in lieu of monetary overtime compensation; and
::(ii) entered into knowingly and voluntarily by such employees and not as a condition of employment.No employee may receive or agree to receive compensatory time off under this subsection unless the employee has worked at least 1,000 hours for the employee’s employer during a period of continuous employment with the employer in the 12-month period before the date of agreement or receipt of compensatory time off.

An employee may also request in writing that monetary compensation be provided, at any time, for all compensatory time accrued that has not yet been used. Within 30 days of receiving the written request, the employer shall provide the employee the monetary compensation due in accordance with paragraph (6).

===(4) Private employer actions– ===

An employer that provides compensatory time under paragraph (1)to employees shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or coerce or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any employee for the purpose of—
:(A) interfering with such employee’s rights under this subsection to request or not request compensatory time off in lieu of payment of monetary overtime compensation for overtime hours; or
:(B) requiring any employee to use such compensatory time.

===(5) Termination of employment– ===

An employee who has accrued compensatory time off authorized to be provided under paragraph (1)shall, upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of employment, be paid for the unused compensatory time in accordance with paragraph (6).
