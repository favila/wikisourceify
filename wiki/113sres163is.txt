{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Calling for more accountable foreign assistance for Cambodia.    Whereas, according to the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]], from 1993 to 2011 the United States provided Cambodia with over $1,247,000,000 in economic and military assistance;   Whereas Cambodia is ranked 138 (out of 187) in the United Nations Development Program’s Human Development Report 2013, a rank shared by the Lao People’s Democratic Republic;   Whereas Cambodia is ranked 157 (out of 174) in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2012, a rank below Yemen and one shared with Angola and Tajikistan;   Whereas Cambodia is ranked“Not Free”in Freedom House’s Freedom in the World 2013 report, which further states,“Cambodia is not an electoral democracy. Elections are conducted under often repressive conditions, and the opposition is hampered by serious legal and physical harassment.”;   Whereas the Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 notes that“a leading human rights problem”in Cambodia is“a weak judiciary … subject to corruption and political influence”;   Whereas Human Rights Watch noted in a May 31, 2012, New York Times op-ed that Prime Minister Hun Sen has remained in power in Cambodia for 10,000 days“through politically motivated violence, control of the security forces, massive corruption, and the tacit support of foreign powers”;   Whereas the July 16, 2012, Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia (A/HRC/21/63) notes that“there are major flaws in the administration of elections in Cambodia and urgent and long-term reforms are needed to give Cambodians confidence in the electoral process and in the workings of the National Election Committee”;   Whereas the July 16, 2012, report includes 18 specific recommendations for improving the election framework and environment in Cambodia to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and political association and expression, including the full participation of opposition leader Sam Rainsy in upcoming parliamentary elections; and   Whereas Sam Rainsy and other opposition members and activists continue to be the target of official harassment through politically motivated accusations and charges, denied due process of law, and excluded from participating in upcoming national elections in Cambodia: Now, therefore, be it

That—
:(1) in order to be considered credible and competitive, the July 2013 parliamentary elections in Cambodia must implement the recommendations contained in the July 16, 2012, Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia (A/HRC/21/63), and must include the full and unfettered participation of all political parties' leaders, specifically Sam Rainsy;
:(2) the [[w:United States Department of State|United States Department of State]]and the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]]should refrain from supporting national or local elections in Cambodia, or deploying election monitors to the July 2013 parliamentary elections, if such [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]recommendations are ignored, and if political parties and opposition leaders are excluded or otherwise hampered from fully and freely participating in electoral processes, including during the campaign period and on election day;
:(3) any election in Cambodia that the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]]determines is not credible and competitive should be deemed as an illegitimate expression of the Cambodian peoples’ will, and an impediment to the democratic development of Cambodia; and
:(4) a Cambodian government formed as a result of such illegitimate elections should not be eligible for direct United States Government assistance, including for the military and police, and the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]and [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]]should jointly reassess and reduce assistance for Cambodia in subsequent fiscal years, and urge international financial institutions to do the same.
