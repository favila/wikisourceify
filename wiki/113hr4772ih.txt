<blockquote> 
:(D) 
::(i) Any person publicly performing sound recordings protected under this title by means of transmissions under a statutory license under this section, or making reproductions of such sound recordings under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/112 section 112(e)], shall make royalty payments for transmissions that person makes of sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972, and reproductions that person makes of those sound recordings under the circumstances described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/112 section 112(e)(1)], in the same manner as such person does for sound recordings that are protected under this title.
::(ii) If a person fails to make royalty payments described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 clause (i)]for sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, there shall be available, in addition to any remedy that may be available under the laws of any State, a civil action in an appropriate United States district court for recovery limited to the payments described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 clause (i)], in addition to interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees. Any such recovery that is obtained shall be offset against any recovery for such violation that may be available under the laws of any State.
::(iii) No action may be brought under the laws of any State against a transmitting entity alleging infringement of a right equivalent to the right granted in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 section 106(6)]based on a public performance of a sound recording fixed before February 15, 1972, or alleging infringement of a right equivalent to the right granted in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 section 106(1)]based on a reproduction of such a sound recording, if—
:::(I) the performance would have been subject to statutory licensing under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 subsection (d)(2)]if the sound recording had been first fixed on or after February 15, 1972;
:::(II) the reproduction would have been subject to statutory licensing under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/112 section 112(e)(1)]if the sound recording had been first fixed on or after February 15, 1972;
:::(III) the transmitting entity has satisfied the requirements for statutory licensing under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 subparagraph (B)]and[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/112 section 112(e)(6)]; and
:::(IV) the applicable royalty was paid and accounted for under this subparagraph.
::(iv) This subparagraph does not confer copyright protection under this title upon sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972. Such sound recordings are subject to the protection available under the laws of the States, and except as provided in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 clause (iii)], are not subject to any limitation of rights or remedies, or any defense, provided under this title.
::(v) This subparagraph shall have no effect with respect to any public performance that is made of a sound recording, or reproduction that is made of a sound recording under the circumstances described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/112 section 112(e)(1)], on or after February 15, 2067. .
