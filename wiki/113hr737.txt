{{section|HA8B84196886C496DA3E8F33B4BA2FE43|2. Findings and purposes}}
(a)
Findings
The
			 [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
(1)
the United States has a history of
			 catastrophic natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, flood, fire,
			 earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions;

(2)
although
			 catastrophic natural disasters occur infrequently, they will continue to occur
			 and are predictable;

(3)
such disasters
			 generate large economic losses and a major component of those losses comes from
			 damage and destruction to homes;

(4)
for the majority
			 of Americans, their investment in their home represents their single biggest
			 asset and the protection of that investment is paramount to economic and social
			 stability;

(5)
the United States
			 needs to take and support State actions to be better prepared for and better
			 protected from catastrophes;

(6)
as the risk of
			 catastrophic losses grows, so do the risks that any premiums collected by
			 private insurers for extending coverage will be insufficient to cover future
			 catastrophes, and private insurers, in an effort to protect their shareholders
			 and policyholders (in the case of mutually owned companies), have thus
			 significantly raised premiums and curtailed insurance coverage in States
			 exposed to major catastrophes;

(7)
such effects on
			 the insurance industry have been harmful to economic activity in States exposed
			 to major catastrophes and have placed significant burdens on residents of such
			 States;

(8)
Hurricanes
			 Katrina, Rita, and Wilma struck the United States in 2005, causing over
			 $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses, and insured losses to homeowners in
			 excess of $50,000,000,000;

(9)
while the total costs of Hurricane Sandy
			 have not yet been calculated, Fitch Ratings, a global credit ratings agency,
			 has estimated that insured losses will amount to between $20,000,000,000 and
			 $25,000,000,000;

(10)
the Federal
			 Government has provided and will continue to provide resources to pay for
			 losses from future catastrophes; and

(11)
it is the proper
			 role of the Federal Government to prepare for and protect its citizens from
			 catastrophes and to facilitate consumer protection, victim assistance, and
			 recovery, including financial recovery.


(b)
Purposes
The purpose of this Act is to establish a
			 national catastrophic risk consortium to ensure the availability and
			 affordability of homeowners’ insurance coverage for catastrophic events.


{{section|H0970400A7E4E4FEDA99FDAA017D19732|3. Establishment; status; principal office; membership}}
