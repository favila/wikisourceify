{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of National Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day.    Whereas the social work profession has been instrumental in achieving advances in civil and human rights in the United States and across the world for more than a century;   Whereas the primary mission of social work is to enhance human well-being and help meet the basic needs of all people, especially the people who are most vulnerable;   Whereas the programs and services provided by professional social workers are essential elements of the social safety net in the United States;   Whereas social workers have a critical impact on adolescent and youth development, aging, family caregiving, child protection and family services, health care navigation, mental and behavioral health treatment, assistance to members and veterans of the Armed Forces, nonprofit management and community development, and poverty reduction;   Whereas social workers function as specialists, consultants, private practitioners, educators, community leaders, policymakers, and researchers;   Whereas social workers influence many different organizations and human service systems and are employed in a wide range of workplaces, including private and public agencies, hospices and hospitals, schools, clinics, businesses and corporations, military units, elected offices, think tanks, and foundations;   Whereas social workers seek to improve social functioning and social conditions for people in emotional, psychological, economic, or physical need;   Whereas social workers are experts in care coordination, case management, and therapeutic treatment for biopsychosocial issues;   Whereas social workers have roles in more than 50 different fields of practice;   Whereas social workers believe that the strength of a country depends on the ability of the majority of the people to lead productive and healthy lives;   Whereas social workers help people, who are often navigating major life challenges, find hope and new options for achieving their maximum potential; and   Whereas social workers identify and address gaps in social systems that impede full participation by individuals or groups in society: Now, therefore, be it
