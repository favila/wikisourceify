{{Center|A BILL}}

 To promote the non-exclusive use of electronic labeling for devices licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “   Enhance Labeling, Accessing, and Branding of Electronic Licenses Act of 2014   ”or the“   E-LABEL Act   ”.  

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]](referred to in this section as the Commission ) first standardized physical labels for licensed products such as computers, phones, and other electronic devices in 1973, and the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]has continually refined physical label requirements over time.
:(2) As devices become smaller, compliance with physical label requirements can become more difficult and costly.
:(3) Many manufacturers and consumers of licensed devices in the United States would prefer to have the option to provide or receive important [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]labeling information digitally on the screen of the device, at the discretion of the user.
:(4) An electronic labeling option would give flexibility to manufacturers in meeting labeling requirements. 

=Sec. 3. Authorization for Federal Communications Commission to allow electronic labeling=

   Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/601 47 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 

=Sec. 720. Optional electronic labeling of communications equipment=



==(a) Definitions– ==

In this section—
:(1) the term electronic labeling means displaying required labeling and regulatory information electronically; and
:(2) the term radiofrequency device with display means any equipment or device that—
::(A) is required under regulations of the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]to be authorized by the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]before the equipment or device may be marketed or sold within the United States; and
::(B) has the capability to digitally display required labeling and regulatory information.

==(b) Requirement To promulgate regulations for electronic labeling– ==

Not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of the  Enhance Labeling, Accessing, and Branding of Electronic Licenses Act of 2014  , the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Commission]]shall promulgate regulations or take other appropriate action, as necessary, to allow manufacturers of radiofrequency devices with display the option to use electronic labeling for the equipment in place of affixing physical labels to the equipment. . 
</blockquote>
 

=Sec. 4. Savings clause=

The amendment made by section 3 shall not be construed to affect the authority of the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]]under  section 302 of the Communications Act of 1934 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/302a 47 U.S.C. 302a] )to provide for electronic labeling of devices.
