={{anchor|H27198337EBDF41B2B84EBB79544D594A}}Section 1. Findings=

The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Paraprofessionals
			 are not substitutes for certified teachers.
:(2) Small class size
			 is fundamental to all learning, but particularly in the early grades.
:(3) Putting more
			 adults in the classroom helps to increase the attention paid to each student
			 and to improve discipline.
:(4) Expanding the
			 availability of entry-level classroom jobs that include opportunities for
			 training and professional development should encourage more adults to enter
			 teacher training and careers in education.
