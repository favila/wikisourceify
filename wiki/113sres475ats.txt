Whereas on June 9, 2014, the Alaska Aces hockey team claimed the championship of the East Coast Hockey League with a 4-0 series-clinching win over the Cincinnati Cyclones, which resulted in the Alaska Aces winning the East Coast Hockey League’s Kelly Cup trophy;   Whereas the June 9 victory gave the Alaska Aces a 4-2 series win in the championship round and resulted in a 16-5 win-loss record for the Alaska Aces in the 2014 playoffs;   Whereas the 2014 East Coast Hockey League championship is the 3rdchampionship for the Alaska Aces in the past 9 years, making the Alaska Aces only the 2ndEast Coast Hockey League team to win more than 2 East Coast Hockey League championships;   Whereas in 2014, the Alaska Aces set an East Coast Hockey League record by winning the team's 4thstraight Brabham Cup, which honors the East Coast Hockey League’s best regular-season record and guarantees home-ice advantage throughout the entire postseason;   Whereas the East Coast Hockey League is a premier “AA” hockey league featuring 22 teams from around the country playing a 72-game regular season schedule;   Whereas the Alaska Aces are affiliated with the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League, opening a pathway to allow promising players to advance to the top tier of professional hockey in the United States and Canada; and   Whereas the people of the State of Alaska are proud of the dedication, hard work, and gritty determination of the players, coaches, and management of the Alaska Aces: Now, therefore, be it
