:(3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated repeatedly in money laundering and illicit activities, including prohibited arms sales, narcotics trafficking, the counterfeiting of United States currency, and the counterfeiting of intellectual property of United States persons.

:(5) North Korea has unilaterally withdrawn from the 1953 Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and committed unprovoked acts of war against South Korea in 2010 by sinking the warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her crew, and by shelling Yeonpyeong Island, killing four civilians.
:(6) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political prison camps that contain as many as 200,000 men, women, and children, who live in atrocious living conditions with insufficient food, clothing, and medical care, and under constant fear of torture or arbitrary execution.
:(7) The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] reaffirms the purposes established in the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// 22 U.S.C. 7802] ).

:(10) The Government of North Korea’s conduct poses an imminent threat to the security of the United States and its allies, to the global economy, to the safety of members of the United States armed forces, to the integrity of the global financial system, to the integrity of global nonproliferation programs, and to the people of North Korea.
:(11) The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] seeks, through this legislation, to use nonmilitary means to address this emergency, to provide diplomatic leverage to negotiate necessary changes in North Korea’s conduct, and to ease the suffering of the people of North Korea.
