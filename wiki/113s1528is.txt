 To establish a national mercury monitoring program, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant ecological and public health concern;
:(2) it is estimated that approximately 410,000 children born each year in the United States are exposed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high enough to impair neurological development;
:(3) the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]have found that 6 percent of women in the United States of childbearing age have blood mercury levels in excess of values determined to be safe by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]];
:(4) exposure to mercury occurs largely by the consumption of contaminated fish, but fish and shellfish are important sources of dietary protein, and a healthy fishing resource is important to the economy of the United States;
:(5) in many locations, the primary route for mercury input to aquatic ecosystems is atmospheric emissions, transport, and deposition;
:(6) existing broad-scale data sets are important but insufficient to track changes in mercury levels in the environment over time, test model predictions, and assess the impact of changing mercury emissions and deposition; and
:(7) a comprehensive national mercury monitoring network to accurately quantify regional and national changes in atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and wildlife in response to changes in mercury emissions would help policy makers, scientists, and the public to better understand the sources, consequences, and trends in United States mercury pollution.

==(6) Mercury export– ==

The term mercury export means mercury flux from a watershed to the corresponding water body, or from one water body to another water body (such as a lake to a river), generally expressed as mass per unit of time.

==(7) Mercury flux– ==

The term mercury flux means the rate of transfer of mercury between ecosystem components (such as between water and air), or between portions of ecosystem components, expressed in terms of mass per unit of time or mass per unit of area per time.

==(8) Surface sediment– ==

The term surface sediment means sediment in the uppermost 2 centimeters of a lakebed or riverbed. 

=Sec. 4. Monitoring program=



==(a) Establishment– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], in consultation with the [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], the [[w:United States Geological Survey|Director of the United States Geological Survey]], the [[w:National Park Service|Director of the National Park Service]], the [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], and the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, shall establish a national mercury monitoring program.

===(2) Purpose– ===

The purpose of the program is to track—
:(A) long-term trends in atmospheric mercury concentrations and deposition; and
:(B) mercury levels in watersheds, surface water, and fish and wildlife in terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems in response to changing mercury emissions over time.

===(3) Monitoring sites– ===



====(A) In general– ====

In carrying out paragraph (1) , not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act and in coordination with the [[w:|Advisory Committee]], the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]shall select multiple monitoring sites representing multiple ecoregions and associated coastal waters of the United States.

====(B) Locations– ====

Locations of monitoring sites shall include National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, National Estuarine Research Reserve units, and sensitive ecological areas in which substantive changes are expected from reductions in domestic mercury emissions.

====(C) Colocation– ====

Monitoring sites shall be colocated with sites from other long-term environmental monitoring programs, where practicable, including sites associated with the National Ecological Observatory Network, the Long-Term Ecological Research Network, and the National Atmospheric Deposition Program.

====(D) Monitoring protocols– ====

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], in coordination with the [[w:|Advisory Committee]], shall establish and publish standardized measurement protocols for the program under this Act.

===(4) International cooperation– ===

To the maximum extent practicable, the program shall be compatible with similar international efforts, including the Global Mercury Observation System and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems.

===(5) Data collection and distribution– ===

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], in coordination with the [[w:|Advisory Committee]], shall establish a centralized database for existing and newly collected environmental mercury data that can be freely accessed on the Internet once data assurance and quality standards established by the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]]are met.

==(b) Functions– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Under the program, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], in consultation with the appropriate Federal agencies and the [[w:|Advisory Committee]], shall at a minimum carry out monitoring described in paragraphs (2) through (4) at the locations selected under subsection (a)(3) .

===(2) Air and Watersheds– ===

The program shall monitor long-term changes in mercury levels and important ancillary measures in the air, including—
:(A) the measurement and recording of wet and estimation of dry mercury deposition, mercury flux, and mercury export;
:(B) the measurement and recording of the level of mercury reemitted from aquatic and terrestrial environments into the atmosphere; and
:(C) the measurement of sulfur species and ancillary measurements to fully understand the cycling of mercury through the ecosystem.

===(3) Water and Soil Chemistry– ===

The program shall monitor long-term changes in mercury and methyl mercury levels and important ancillary measures in the water and soil or sediments, including—
