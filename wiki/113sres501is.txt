{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commemorating the 20thanniversary of the Wright Museum of WWII History in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire.    Whereas on July 16, 1994, the Wright Museum of WWII History opened as an educational institution in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, founded by David Wright;   Whereas for the past 20 years the Wright Museum has fulfilled its mission to preserve and share the stories of the people of the United States during World War II, and is the only United States museum that exclusively focuses on the contributions and enduring legacy of World War II-era Americans;   Whereas the Wright Museum accomplishes its mission through the careful preservation and thoughtful display of its extensive permanent collection of World War II-era items and memorabilia from the years between 1939 and 1945;   Whereas the Wright Museum is unique among traditional World War II museums in that the over 14,000 items in its permanent collection are representative of both the battlefield and the United States homefront;   Whereas the Wright Museum has established a national reputation as a repository for historically significant World War II-era items and memorabilia;   Whereas the Wright Museum uses its permanent collection to introduce visitors to a seminal period in United States history and place that period into historical context;   Whereas for 2 decades the Wright Museum has educated, entertained, and inspired over 200,000 visitors from across the United States and around the world; and   Whereas the Wright Museum remains dedicated to David Wright’s vision of providing a vivid perspective on the profound and enduring impact of the World War II experience on United States society: Now, therefore, be it
