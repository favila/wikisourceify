:(2) The National Diabetes Prevention Program, as established by the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] , has been proven to reduce the onset of diabetes in at-risk adults by 58 percent, using a cost-effective, community-based intervention.

=={{anchor|id030287EE862A4ED183451787085AA744}}(b) Sense of the Senate– ==

It is the sense of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] that the National Diabetes Prevention Program presents an opportunity for States to reduce the incidence of diabetes among individuals enrolled in their Medicaid programs.
