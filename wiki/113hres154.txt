Expressing support for designation of April 15, 2013, through April 21, 2013, as National Minority Cancer Awareness Week.Whereas cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 1 in every 4 deaths;Whereas this year it is estimated that more than 1,660,000 individuals in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer and more than 580,000 individuals will die from the disease;Whereas complex and interrelated factors contribute to the observed disparities in cancer incidence and death among racial, ethnic, and underserved groups;Whereas African-American women have the highest death rates for breast cancer of all racial and ethnic groups and are 40 percent more likely to die of breast cancer than White women;Whereas colorectal cancer continues to kill a disproportionate number of African-Americans each year;Whereas colorectal cancer mortality rates among African-American men and women are about 44 percent higher than in White men and women;Whereas more Hispanics in the United States die from cancer each year than from any other cause;Whereas Hispanic Americans have higher rates of cancers related to infections (stomach, liver, and cervix) and are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease when treatment may be more difficult;Whereas Asian/Pacific Islander men and women have lower evidence-based cancer screening utilization compared to White men and women;Whereas Asian/Pacific Islander men are twice as likely to die from stomach cancer as compared to the non-Hispanic White population, and Asian/Pacific Islander women are 2.7 times as likely to die from the same disease;Whereas American Indian/Alaska Native men were almost twice as likely to have stomach and liver cancer as compared to non-Hispanic White men;Whereas American Indian/Alaska Native women are 2.8 times more likely to have, and almost twice as likely to die from liver cancer, as compared to non-Hispanic White women;Whereas this year, cancer will claim the lives of more than 250,000 women in the United States;Whereas breast cancer is by far the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women;Whereas in the United States, it is estimated that 230,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, and approximately 40,000 women will die from the disease;Whereas public awareness and educational campaigns on cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms are held during the week of April each year;Whereas April 15, 2013, through April 21, 2013, would be an appropriate week to designate as National Minority Cancer Awareness Week; andWhereas continued research and educational efforts can help provide information to the public of methods of prevention and screening, as well as about symptoms for early detection: Now, therefore, be it
