{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish fair and transparent practices related to the marketing and provision of overdraft coverage programs at depository institutions, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Overdraft Protection Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=

 Section 102 of the Truth in Lending Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1601 15 U.S.C. 1601] )is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

<blockquote>

==(c) Fairness and accountability in overdraft coverage– ==



===(1) Findings– ===

The Congress also finds that—
:(A) overdraft coverage is a form of short-term credit that depository institutions provide for consumer transaction accounts. Historically, depository institutions covered overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc basis;
:(B) with the growth in specially designed software programs and in consumer use of debit cards, overdraft coverage for a fee has become more prevalent;
:(C) many depository institutions offer a range of overdraft options but aggressively encourage consumers to consent to the most expensive option, where a high flat fee is collected for every individual overdraft transaction;
:(D) most depository institutions collect a high flat fee, including for small dollar transactions, each time the institution covers an overdraft, in some cases impose multiple overdraft coverage fees within a single day, and many charge additional fees for each day during which the account remains overdrawn; and
:(E) such abusive practices in connection with overdraft coverage fees have deprived consumers of meaningful choices about their accounts and placed significant financial burdens on low- and moderate-income consumers.

===(2) Purpose– ===

It is the purpose of this title to protect consumers by limiting abusive overdraft coverage fees and practices, and by providing meaningful disclosures and consumer choice in connection with overdraft coverage fees..
</blockquote>


=Sec. 3. Definitions=



==(a) Additional definitions– ==

 Section 103 of the Truth in Lending Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1602 15 U.S.C. 1602] )is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

<blockquote>

====(1) Check– ====

The term check has the same meaning as in section 3(6) of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5001 12 U.S.C. 5001 et seq.] ), other than a travelers check.

::(B) the depository institution retains the discretion to pay (without assessing an overdraft coverage fee) or reject overdrafts incurred by the consumer beyond the numbers described in subparagraph (A);

:(2) the type of transaction;
:(3) the overdraft amount;
:(4) the overdraft coverage fee;

====(1) Notice and Opportunity To Cancel– ====

:(A) warn any consumer covered by an overdraft coverage program who engages in a transaction through an automated teller machine or a branch teller if completing the transaction would trigger overdraft coverage fees, including the amount of the fees; and
