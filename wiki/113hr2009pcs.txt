=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On May 10, 2013, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] admitted that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, seeking tax-exempt status.
:(2) This action raises pertinent questions about the agency’s ability to implement and oversee[[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]] and [[Public Law 111-152|Public Law 111–152]]  .
:(3) This action could be an indication of future [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] abuses in relation to [[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]]  and [[Public Law 111-152|Public Law 111–152]]  given that it is their responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual mandate.
:(4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the Federal Government. 

=Sec. 3. Prohibiting enforcement of PPACA and HCERA=

The [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] , or any delegate of the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]] , shall not implement or enforce any provisions of or amendments made by [[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]]  or[[Public Law 111-152|111–152]] .
