Subject to subparagraph (C) , a child that a State reasonably believes is a qualified newborn (and thus eligible for medical assistance under subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(X) ) on the date of such child’s birth shall be deemed to have applied for medical assistance and to have been found eligible for such assistance under such plan on the date of such birth and to remain eligible for such assistance until such child is one year of age, unless a State determines that a child is not eligible for such medical assistance through a redetermination under  subparagraph (D)  .
