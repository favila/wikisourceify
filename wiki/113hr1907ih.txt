{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish direct care registered nurse-to-patient staffing ratio requirements in hospitals, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title; table of contents; findings=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the “Nurse Staffing Standards for Patient Safety and Quality Care Act of 2013” .

==(b) Table of contents– ==

The table of content for this Act is as follows:**[[#H0F55CBFC3A724E90A53CC093E21D8ED8|Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings.]]
**[[#HCB3C7D09ECCC42FB8AA50EAB675891BC|Sec. 2. Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirement.]]
**[[#H8FC93DED0701439C90C333FDB3040FF8|Sec. 3. Enforcement of requirements through Federal programs.]]
**[[#H811C0C27D0FE4E5CAC340E1E81BF4B38|Sec. 4. Nurse Workforce Initiative.]]


==(c) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in promoting quality care and improving the delivery of health care services to patients in health care facilities in the United States.
:(2) Recent changes in health care delivery systems that have resulted in higher acuity levels among patients in health care facilities increase the need for improved quality measures in order to protect patient care and reduce the incidence of medical errors.
:(3) Inadequate and poorly monitored registered nurse staffing practices that result in too few registered nurses providing direct care jeopardize the delivery of quality health care services.
:(4) Numerous studies have shown that patient outcomes are directly correlated to direct care registered nurse staffing levels, including a 2002 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations report that concluded that the lack of direct care registered nurses contributed to nearly a quarter of the unanticipated problems that result in injury or death to hospital patients.
:(5) Requirements for direct care registered nurse staffing ratios will help address the registered nurse shortage in the United States by aiding in recruitment of new registered nurses and improving retention of registered nurses who are considering leaving direct patient care because of demands created by inadequate staffing.
:(6) Establishing adequate minimum direct care registered nurse-to-patient ratios that take into account patient acuity measures will improve the delivery of quality health care services and guarantee patient safety.
:(7) Establishing safe staffing standards for direct care registered nurses is a critical component of assuring that there is adequate hospital staffing at all levels to improve the delivery of quality care and protect patient safety.
