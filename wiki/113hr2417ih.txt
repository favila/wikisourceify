{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Federal Power Act to protect the bulk-power system and electric infrastructure critical to the defense and well-being of the United States against natural and manmade electromagnetic pulse (“EMP”) threats and vulnerabilities.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Secure High-voltage Infrastructure for Electricity from Lethal Damage Act ”or the“ SHIELD Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) According to the Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack (in this Act referred to as the“EMP Commission Report”), the society and economy of the United States are“critically dependent upon the availability of electricity.”.
:(2) According to the EMP Commission Report,“continued electrical supply is necessary for sustaining water supplies, production and distribution of food, fuel, communications, and everything else that is part of our economy”.
:(3) According to the EMP Commission Report,“contemporary U.S. society is not structured, nor does it have the means, to provide for the needs of nearly 300 million Americans without electricity.”.
:(4) According to the EMP Commission Report, due to the existing electrical system operating at or near its physical capacity,“a relatively modest upset to the system can cause functional collapse.”.
:(5) According to the EMP Commission Report, electromagnetic pulse (in this Act referred to as“EMP”) is a threat to the overall electrical power system.
:(6) According to the EMP Commission Report, EMP occurs both naturally, such as geomagnetic storms, and via manmade devices.
:(7) According to the EMP Commission Report, while the electric infrastructure“<nowiki>has a degree of durability against … the failure of one or a small number of [electric] components,</nowiki>”the current strategy for recovery leaves the United States ill-prepared to respond effectively to an EMP attack that would potentially result in damage to vast numbers of components nearly simultaneously over an unprecedented geographic scale.
:(8) According to the EMP Commission Report, EMP“may couple ultimately unmanageable currents and voltages into an electrical system routinely operated with little margin and cause the collapse of large portions of the electrical system.”.
:(9) According to the EMP Commission Report, a collapse of large portions of the electrical system will result in significant periods of power-outage and“<nowiki>restoration from collapse or loss of significant portions of the system [will be] exceedingly difficult.</nowiki>”.
:(10) According to the EMP Commission Report,“should the electrical power system be lost for any substantial period of time … the consequences are likely to be catastrophic to civilian society.”.
:(11) According to the EMP Commission Report,“<nowiki>the Commission is deeply concerned that [negative] impacts [on the electric infrastructure] are certain in an EMP event unless practical steps are taken to provide protection for critical elements of the electric system.</nowiki>”.
