To lift the trade embargo on Cuba, and for other
		  purposes.

={{anchor|H80CDBB6AF2E64177B867267DA3D31B73}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the
			 “Free Trade With Cuba
			 Act”.

={{anchor|H86A50FD27F7A48EDBB5AC24B7D21873E}}Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) with the end of
			 the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba is no longer a threat
			 to the United States or the Western Hemisphere;
:(2) the continuation
			 of the embargo on trade between the United States and Cuba that was declared in
			 February of 1962 is counterproductive, adding to the hardships of the Cuban
			 people while making the United States the scapegoat for the failures of the
			 communist system;
:(3) in the countries
			 of the former Soviet Union and the former Eastern bloc, China, and Vietnam, the
			 United States is using economic, cultural, academic, and scientific engagement
			 to support its policy of promoting democratic and human rights reforms;
			 and
:(4) the United States
			 can best support democratic change in Cuba by promoting trade and commerce,
			 travel, communications, and cultural, academic, and scientific
			 exchanges.
