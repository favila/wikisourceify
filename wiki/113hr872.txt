{{Center|A BILL}}

To lift the trade embargo on Cuba, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Free Trade With Cuba Act”.

2. Findings


The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds that—
: with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba is no longer a threat to the United States or the Western Hemisphere;: the continuation of the embargo on trade between the United States and Cuba that was declared in February of 1962 is counterproductive, adding to the hardships of the Cuban people while making the United States the scapegoat for the failures of the communist system;: in the countries of the former Soviet Union and the former Eastern bloc, China, and Vietnam, the United States is using economic, cultural, academic, and scientific engagement to support its policy of promoting democratic and human rights reforms; and: the United States can best support democratic change in Cuba by promoting trade and commerce, travel, communications, and cultural, academic, and scientific exchanges.
