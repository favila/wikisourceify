=Sec. 3. Findings=

Congress finds that—

::(B) has existed for over 20 years, long before other communities began to focus on the interrelationship between urban centers and outdoor opportunities that strengthen economies;

::(A) the Greenway Trust is led by a 60-person board that includes local and State officials, agency staff, and business and nonprofit representatives;
::(B) thousands of volunteers have donated hundreds of thousands of hours to the Greenway supporting stewardship projects on public lands; and
