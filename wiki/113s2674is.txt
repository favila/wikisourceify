This Act may be cited as the“   Columbia River Basin Restoration Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) the Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest by volume;

::(A) multiple national parks;
::(B) components of the National Wilderness Preservation System;
::(C) National Monuments;
::(D) National Scenic Areas;
::(E) National Recreation Areas;
::(F) other areas managed for conservation; and
::(G) multiple tribal reservations and over 45,000,000 acres of tribally comanaged land;
:(3) the Columbia River Basin and associated tributaries (referred to in this Act as the“Basin”) provide significant ecological and economic benefits to the Pacific Northwest and the entire United States;
:(4) traditionally, the Basin includes more than 6,000,000 acres of irrigated agricultural land and produces more hydroelectric power than any other North American river;
:(5) significant commerce takes place on the federally authorized Columbia Snake River System navigation channel, which is 465 miles in length, from the mouth of the Columbia River to Lewiston, Idaho;
:(6) the Basin—
::(A) historically constituted the largest salmon-producing river system in the world, with annual returns peaking at as many as 16,000,000 fish; and
::(B) as of the date of enactment of this Act—
:::(i) supports economically important commercial and recreational fisheries;
:::(ii) supports treaty tribal fisheries;
:::(iii) is home to numerous species of salmonids, including steelhead, bull trout, and Kootenai white sturgeon, that are listed as threatened species or endangered species under the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.]); and
:::(iv) is a cultural and historical resource and provides sports and recreation opportunities for millions annually;
:(7) toxics are present throughout the Columbia River Basin that are harmful to humans, fish, and wildlife;
:(8) studies have shown that Columbia River fish contain a wide array of contaminants;
:(9) a fish consumption survey in the Columbia River Basin showed that tribal members were eating 6 to 11 times more fish than the estimated national average;
:(10) in 2013, the States of Oregon and Washington issued a fish advisories warning against consumption of resident fish between Bonneville Dam to McNary Dam because of toxic contamination;
:(11) in 1995, the lower river and estuary was designated an“estuary of national significance”in accordance with  section 320 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1330 33 U.S.C. 1330] ), because of degradation and contamination in the lower river, lack of structure to coordinate programs and policies, significance of the lower river to survival of species throughout the basin, and the importance the lower river to the economic viability of the region; and
:(12) 
::(A) in 2006, the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]named the Columbia River Basin 1 of the 10 large aquatic ecosystems in the United States;
::(B) the Columbia River Basin is the only large aquatic ecosystem in the United States that does not receive dedicated appropriations as a large aquatic ecosystem; and
::(C) the other 9 large aquatic ecosystems receive appropriations through the Geographic Programs Program Area of the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].
