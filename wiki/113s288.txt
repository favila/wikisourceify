=={{anchor|id8AE1C4D0A82B4E12A6A21F1A2DF62A82}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) One of the core missions of the [[w:National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation]] is“to achieve excellence in U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education”.
:(2) According to the National Academy of Sciences, STEM education at the undergraduate level is vital to developing a workforce that will allow the United States to remain the leader in the 21st century global economy.
:(3) According to the National Academy of Sciences, in order to maintain scientific and engineering leadership amid increasing economic and educational globalization, the United States must aggressively pursue the innovative capacity of all people in the United States—women and men.
:(4) According to the August 2011 report “Women in STEM: A Gender Gap to Innovation”, the [[w:United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] found the following:
::(A) “According to the Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey (ACS), women comprise 48 percent of the U.S. workforce but just 24 percent of STEM workers.”.
::(B) <nowiki>“[B]etween 2000 and 2009, women’s share of the STEM workforce remained constant at 24 percent, while their share of all college-educated workers increased from 46 to 49 percent”.</nowiki>
::(C) “The ACS data on undergraduate fields of study show that women account for nearly half of employed college graduates age 25 and over, but only about 25 percent of employed STEM degree holders and an even smaller share—just about 20 percent—of STEM degree holders working in STEM jobs.”.
:(5) In 2007, underrepresented minority groups comprised 33.2 percent of the college-age population of the United States, but only 17.7 percent of undergraduate students earning a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field.
:(6) The Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that, while freshmen from underrepresented minority groups express an interest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate degree at the same rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino students, 18.4 percent of African-American students, and 18.8 percent of Native American students studying in STEM fields complete their degree within 5 years, compared to an approximate 33 percent and 42 percent 5-year completion rate for White and Asian students, respectively.
:(7) According to the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, Inc., no one race or ethnic category will be a majority by 2050, and as the United States works to remain competitive in the world of technological innovation, the United States should address the need to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented minority segments of the population who work in engineering.
