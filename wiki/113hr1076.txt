The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act([[Public Law -|Public Law 111–148]] )is amended by inserting after section 1332([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18052 42 U.S.C. 18052] )the following new section (and inserting a corresponding item in the table of contents of the Act):

={{anchor|HAEEFDC1267774ABB9DE4909D0A64F288}}Sec. 1332A. Savings from State authorized public entity benefits pools=



=={{anchor|HA43745870CEA48BDB28F8F9D9CCF436F}}(a) Application– ==



==={{anchor|H9D923BC7DDEE441EB1EE22344B77E09B}}(1) In general– ===

A State authorized public entity health benefits pool (in this section referred to as a pool ) may apply to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] for a pass through of funding described in subsection (b)with respect to health care benefits provided through that pool for coverage years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.

==={{anchor|H89CB165C0A79475AACA3F718275C38ED}}(2) Approval of application– ===

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall approve such an application of a pool if the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines that health care benefits provided through the pool—
:(A) will provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the coverage defined in section 1302(b);
:(B) will provide coverage and cost sharing protections against excessive out-of-pocket spending that are at least as affordable as the provisions of this title would provide; and
:(C) will result in cost savings to the Federal Government because the cost of providing health care benefits to individuals through the pool will be less than the cost of providing health care benefits to such individuals had they become participants in a qualified health plan offered through an Exchange, and so the payment amount under subsection (b)will be less than the total of premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions, or small business credits that would otherwise be required if individuals and small employers in the pool were instead participants in an Exchange.

==={{anchor|H194A3B1D87A6445992BE74F21F4027AE}}(3) Consideration– ===

Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall promulgate regulations relating to pass through of funding under this section. The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall begin accepting applications under this section no later than 180 days after such date of enactment.

==={{anchor|HC5082DC0FDBA4169AEBDECEE05F71DD1}}(4) Additional consequences of approval– ===

An individual receiving health care benefits through such a pool for which such an application is approved under this section shall be treated, for purposes of [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text// section 5000A] of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as being covered under minimum essential coverage described in subsection (f)(1)(E) of such section.

=={{anchor|H1DF305C4AABE40608809EBD5492A779E}}(b) Pass through of funding– ==



==={{anchor|H578232AD53134D8F845A8F8C0238CC7A}}(1) In general– ===

With respect to a pool application under subsection (a)(1), under which individuals and small employers in the pool would not qualify for the premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions, or small business credits under sections 36Bor 45R of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986for which they would otherwise be eligible if they had entered an Exchange, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall provide for an alternative means by which an aggregate amount determined under paragraph (2)shall be paid to the pool for purposes of implementing the application.

==={{anchor|H359EC324DD094F02A26D3D58FBA9CAA2}}(2) Payment determination– ===

The amount to be paid under paragraph (1)shall be determined—
:(A) based on the sum of premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions, and small business credits under sections 36Bor 45R of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986that would have been provided with respect to individuals in the pool had the health care benefits provided by the pool been a qualified health plan offered in an Exchange, but taking into account the lower cost of providing health care benefits to individuals through the pool; and
:(B) annually by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] , taking into consideration the experience of individuals and small employers participating in Exchanges.

=={{anchor|H2CE01E5D60CC4A0FA14D542D074D0F40}}(c) Timely determination by secretary– ==

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall make a determination under subsection (a)(1)with respect to the application of a pool not later than 180 days after the date of receipt of such application, and shall notify the pool involved of such determination.
