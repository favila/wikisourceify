{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to clarify when certain academic assessments shall be administered.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Student Testing Improvement and Accountability Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Prior to 2001, Federal law required States only to test students once per grade span.
:(2) Following the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 , Federal education policy has placed an increased emphasis on testing assessments, requiring students to undergo standardized testing every year in grades 3–8.
:(3) Reducing the frequency of federally required testing would allow more time for classroom instruction, decrease the burden on educational resources associated with testing, and move our public education system away from the practice of“teaching to the test”.
:(4) The yearly testing currently required by Federal law should be replaced with grade span testing. 

=Sec. 3. Academic assessments=

   Section 1111(b)(3)(C) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6311 20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)(C)])is amended—
:(1) in clause (v)(I) —
::(A) by striking“except as otherwise provided for grades 3 through 8 under clause vii,”; and
::(B) by inserting“and the achievement of students against the challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards”after“proficiency of students”;
:(2) by striking clause (vii) ; and
:(3) in clause (viii) , by striking“, (vi), (vii)”and inserting“and (vi)”.
