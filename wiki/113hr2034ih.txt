{{Center|A BILL}}

To provide for the establishment and operation of Advanced Composites Development Centers.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Advanced Composites Development Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Compared to traditional metals and woods, reinforced composite materials are lightweight, corrosion resistant, high strength, and durable.
:(2) Because of their intrinsic physical qualities, composites have the ability to address national priorities in infrastructure, energy, defense, and natural disaster mitigation with innovative solutions.
:(3) To this end, research on advancement in composite material development, new applications for composites, or advanced manufacturing processes serves a critical national interest.

=Sec. 3. Advanced Composites Development Centers=



==(a) Establishment of program– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] , the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] , the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] , and the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] shall carry out a program to improve our Nation’s transportation infrastructure, advance the technologies used to produce alternative energy, enhance our military security, and develop new disaster mitigation systems by making grants to consortia to establish and operate Advanced Composites Development Centers. In doing so, they shall work with stakeholders to identify problems that can be solved over a period of 5 years through the development of an advanced composite material. By working with the private sector and focusing on solutions to problems that can be researched, developed, and demonstrated over a short period of time, each Center will strive to produce new composite materials, including related manufacturing processes or applications, that are lighter, stronger, and more durable than existing materials, have lower life-cycle costs or lower overall environmental impacts, and have an immediate practical application.

===(2) Designation of Centers– ===

The Centers shall be designated as follows:
:(A) The [[w:United States Department of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] shall designate 1 Center for the development of advanced composites in civil infrastructure and transportation.
:(B) The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] shall designate 1 Center for the development of advanced composites in energy technology.
:(C) The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] shall designate 1 Center for the development of advanced composites in military operations.
:(D) The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] shall designate 1 Center for the development of advanced composites in disaster prevention and response.
:(E) Any 2 or more of the Secretaries described in subparagraphs (A) through (D)may work together to explore opportunities to designate a single Center that addresses issues of importance to the Departments of each such Secretary.

===(3) Additional collaboration– ===

Each Secretary designating a Center under paragraph (2)may include reviewers from the [[w:National Institute of Standards and Technology|Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology]] and the [[w:National Science Foundation|Director of the National Science Foundation]] to leverage work that has been done at facilities supported by each of those agencies.

==(b) Consortia– ==



===(1) Eligibility– ===

To be eligible to receive a grant under this section for the establishment and operation of a Center, a consortium shall—
:(A) be composed of qualifying entities, including at least 1 prime applicant and 1 private company;
:(B) operate subject to a binding agreement entered into by its members that documents—
::(i) the proposed partnership agreement, including the governance and management structure of the Center;
::(ii) measures to enable cost-effective implementation of the program under this section;
::(iii) a proposed budget, including financial contributions from non-Federal sources;
::(iv) conflict of interest procedures consistent with subsection (d)(2), all known material conflicts of interest, and corresponding mitigation plans; and
::(v) an accounting structure that enables the Secretary to ensure that the consortium has complied with the requirements of this section; and
:(C) operate as a nonprofit organization.

===(2) Application– ===

A consortium seeking to establish and operate a Center under this section, acting through a prime applicant, shall transmit to the Secretary an application at such time, in such form, and accompanied by such information as the Secretary shall require, including a detailed description of the elements of the consortium agreement required under paragraph (1)(B). If the consortium members will not be located at one centralized location, such application shall include a communications plan that ensures close coordination and integration of the Center’s activities.

==(c) Selection and schedule– ==



===(1) Selection– ===

The Secretary shall select consortia for grants for the establishment and operation of Centers through competitive selection processes. In selecting consortia, the Secretary shall consider—
:(A) the information a consortium must disclose according to subsection (b);
:(B) any existing facilities a consortium will provide for Center activities;
:(C) experience in design, prototyping, and testing advanced composites;
:(D) existing ISO 17025 certification;
:(E) experience and achievements working with the private sector and commercializing composite materials technologies; and
:(F) opportunities to leverage previous support that a member of the consortium has received from the Department or Departments awarding the grant, the [[w:National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology]] , or the [[w:National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation]] to research, develop, demonstrate, or commercialize an advanced composite.

===(2) Schedule– ===

Grants made for the establishment and operation of a Center shall be for a period not to exceed 5 years, after which the grant may be renewed, subject to a competitive selection process.
