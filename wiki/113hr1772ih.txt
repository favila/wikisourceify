:(I) obtaining from the individual the individual’s social security account number and recording the number on the form (if the individual claims to have been issued such a number), and, if the individual does not attest to United States nationality under subparagraph (B), obtaining such identification or authorization number established by the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] for the alien as the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] may specify, and recording such number on the form; and
:(II) examining—
::(aa) a document relating to the individual presenting it described in clause (ii); or

======(v) Authority to prohibit use of certain documents– ======

If the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] finds, by regulation, that any document described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii)as establishing employment authorization or identity does not reliably establish such authorization or identity or is being used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] may prohibit or place conditions on its use for purposes of this paragraph.

======(vi) Signature– ======

Such attestation may be manifested by either a hand-written or electronic signature.

::(aa) in the case of the recruiting or referral of an individual, 3 years after the date of the recruiting or referral; and
::(bb) in the case of the hiring of an individual, the later of 3 years after the date the verification is completed or one year after the date the individual’s employment is terminated; and
:(II) during the verification period (as defined in subparagraph (E)), make an inquiry, as provided in subsection (d), using the verification system to seek verification of the identity and employment eligibility of an individual.

======(ii) Confirmation– ======



=======(I) Confirmation received– =======

If the person or other entity receives an appropriate confirmation of an individual’s identity and work eligibility under the verification system within the time period specified, the person or entity shall record on the form an appropriate code that is provided under the system and that indicates a final confirmation of such identity and work eligibility of the individual.

=======(II) Tentative nonconfirmation received– =======

If the person or other entity receives a tentative nonconfirmation of an individual’s identity or work eligibility under the verification system within the time period specified, the person or entity shall so inform the individual for whom the verification is sought. If the individual does not contest the nonconfirmation within the time period specified, the nonconfirmation shall be considered final. The person or entity shall then record on the form an appropriate code which has been provided under the system to indicate a final nonconfirmation. If the individual does contest the nonconfirmation, the individual shall utilize the process for secondary verification provided under subsection (d). The nonconfirmation will remain tentative until a final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided by the verification system within the time period specified. In no case shall an employer terminate employment of an individual because of a failure of the individual to have identity and work eligibility confirmed under this section until a nonconfirmation becomes final. Nothing in this clause shall apply to a termination of employment for any reason other than because of such a failure. In no case shall an employer rescind the offer of employment to an individual because of a failure of the individual to have identity and work eligibility confirmed under this subsection until a nonconfirmation becomes final. Nothing in this subclause shall apply to a recission of the offer of employment for any reason other than because of such a failure.

=======(III) Final confirmation or nonconfirmation received– =======

If a final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided by the verification system regarding an individual, the person or entity shall record on the form an appropriate code that is provided under the system and that indicates a confirmation or nonconfirmation of identity and work eligibility of the individual.

=======(IV) Extension of time– =======

If the person or other entity in good faith attempts to make an inquiry during the time period specified and the verification system has registered that not all inquiries were received during such time, the person or entity may make an inquiry in the first subsequent working day in which the verification system registers that it has received all inquiries. If the verification system cannot receive inquiries at all times during a day, the person or entity merely has to assert that the entity attempted to make the inquiry on that day for the previous sentence to apply to such an inquiry, and does not have to provide any additional proof concerning such inquiry.

=======(V) Consequences of nonconfirmation– =======



========(aa) Termination or notification of continued employment– ========

If the person or other entity has received a final nonconfirmation regarding an individual, the person or entity may terminate employment of the individual (or decline to recruit or refer the individual). If the person or entity does not terminate employment of the individual or proceeds to recruit or refer the individual, the person or entity shall notify the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] of such fact through the verification system or in such other manner as the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] may specify.

========(bb) Failure to notify– ========

If the person or entity fails to provide notice with respect to an individual as required under item (aa), the failure is deemed to constitute a violation of subsection (a)(1)(A)with respect to that individual.

=======(VI) Continued employment after final nonconfirmation– =======

If the person or other entity continues to employ (or to recruit or refer) an individual after receiving final nonconfirmation, a rebuttable presumption is created that the person or entity has violated subsection (a)(1)(A).
