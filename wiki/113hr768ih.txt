{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require the establishment of teacher evaluation programs.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Securing Teacher Effectiveness, Leadership, Learning, And Results Act of 2013”or the“STELLAR Act”.

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Effective teachers and principals are the backbone of our schools and the key to successful students.
:(2) Teachers and principals deserve our full support as they take on one of the most important and most challenging responsibilities—educating our children.
:(3) High-quality evaluations that provide meaningful feedback are a crucial element to giving educators the support they need to successfully achieve at high levels.
:(4) Teachers and principals also deserve access to professional development opportunities so they can continue to learn and grow as educators.
:(5) Research shows that high-quality and effective teaching is the single most important school-based factor impacting student learning.
:(6) In formal studies, including research highlighted in“The Widget Effect”, nearly 75 percent of teachers reported that they have not received specific suggestions on how to improve classroom practices in annual evaluations.
:(7) Across all local educational agencies, only 43 percent of teachers, including novice teachers who may benefit the most from feedback, report that current evaluations systems are helpful.
:(8) Research also shows that school leadership quality is second only to teacher quality among school-related factors in its impact on student learning.
:(9) Strong school leadership is a key determinant of whether schools can attract and retain effective teachers particularly in high poverty schools, as research has found teachers’ satisfaction to be more influenced by the culture of the school than by the demographics of the school’s students.
:(10) Principals set the direction and vision for a school, and studies find that strong instructional leadership and a focus on building a shared mission focused on student achievement can create a positive teaching and learning environment.
:(11) Constructive feedback specifying areas for improvement could be useful to both teachers and principals who are dedicated to growing professionally.
:(12) The most effective way to turn around a struggling school is through talented teachers and an inspirational principal.
:(13) Effective teachers and principals also deserve to be recognized for excellence and to receive commendations in areas of strong performance and improvement.
:(14) Evaluations should give teachers and principals the opportunity to foster mutually beneficial professional relationships.
:(15) Teachers and principals should provide input and contribute directly to designing, implementing, and improving evaluation systems in their school districts.
:(16) High-quality teacher and principal evaluations have the potential to be a powerful tool and should play a significant role in building a talented force of educators.
:(17) The goal of evaluation systems is to improve individual, as well as whole school and district, teaching and leadership practices to benefit students.

:(I) in predominant part, student learning gains on the State’s academic assessments established under paragraph (3)or, for grades and subjects not covered by the State’s academic assessments, another valid and reliable assessment of student academic achievement as long as the assessment is used consistently by the local educational agency in which the teacher is employed for the grade or subject area for which the assessment is administered;
:(II) at least one other valid and reliable measure of student academic achievement that is used consistently across the local educational agency in which the teacher is employed for the grade or subject area being measured; and
:(III) if available, value-added measures that track individual student academic growth while under the instruction of the teacher.

=====(ii) Observations of teacher performance– =====

A portion of the evaluation is based on observations of the teacher’s performance in the classroom by more than 1 trained and objective observer—
:(I) that take place on several occasions during the school year in which the teacher is being evaluated; and
:(II) under which—
::(aa) a teacher is evaluated against a rigorous rubric that defines multiple performance categories in alignment with the State’s professional standards for teachers and definition of teacher and principal effectiveness as specified in clause (i); and
::(bb) observation ratings meaningfully differentiate among teachers’ performance and bear a relationship to evidence of student academic growth with respect to the State’s academic standards.

=====(iii) Meaningful differentiation– =====

The evaluation provides performance ratings that meaningfully differentiate among teacher performance using the performance ratings and levels described in subparagraph (A)(i).

=====(iv) Comparability of student gains– =====

For a principal of a secondary school, a portion of the evaluation is based on improvements in the school’s graduation rate as defined in section 200.19(b) of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations as in effect on the date of enactment of this paragraph, when applicable, or in the case of a secondary school with a graduation rate of more than 90 percent, the success of the principal in maintaining such graduation rate.

=====(iii) Support of effective teachers– =====

A portion of the evaluation is based on the recruitment, development, evaluation, and retention of effective teachers.

=====(iv) Leadership abilities– =====

A portion of the evaluation is based on the leadership abilities of the principal, as measured by observations of the principal and other relevant data evaluated against a rigorous rubric that defines multiple performance categories in alignment with the State’s professional standards for principals.

=====(v) Content of observation ratings– =====

The observations described in clause (iv)provide observation ratings that—
:(I) meaningfully differentiate among principals’ performance; and
:(II) bear a strong relationship to evidence of student academic growth with respect to the State’s academic standards.
