==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The United States has been engaged in military operations in Afghanistan since October 2001 as Operation Enduring Freedom and in military operations in Iraq since March 2003 as Operation Iraqi Freedom and its successor contingency operation, Operation New Dawn.
:(2) According to the Congressional Research Service, through fiscal year 2013, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has appropriated $1,500,000,000,000 for the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] , for the State Department, and for medical costs paid by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] . This amount includes $821,000,000,000 related to operations in Iraq and $645,000,000,000 related to operations in Afghanistan.
:(3) Over 90 percent of the funds appropriated for the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have been provided as supplemental or additional appropriations and designated as an emergency funding requirement.
:(4) The [[w:Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office]] and the [[w:Library of Congress|Congressional Research Service]] have stated that future costs for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are difficult to estimate because the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] provides little information on costs incurred to date and actual expenditure for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (because war and baseline funds are mixed in the same accounts) and because of a lack of information from the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] on many of the key factors that determine costs, including personnel levels and the pace of operations.
:(5) Over 2,400,000 members of the United States Armed Forces have served in Afghanistan and Iraq since the beginning of the conflicts.
:(6) Over 4,400 members of the Armed Forces and Department of Defense civilian personnel have been killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and over 2,100 members of the Armed Forces and Department of Defense civilian personnel have been killed in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.
:(7) Over 1,715 members of the Armed Forces have suffered amputations as a result of wounds or other injuries incurred in Afghanistan or Iraq.
:(8) More than 250,000 veterans of military service in Iraq and Afghanistan have been treated for mental health conditions, more than 100,000 of these veterans have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and approximately 253,330 of these veterans have a confirmed traumatic brain injury diagnosis.
:(9) Approximately 54 percent of veterans of military service in Iraq and Afghanistan have sought treatment at a [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] hospital or medical clinic.
:(10) The Independent Review Group on Rehabilitative Care and Administrative Processes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center identified traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, increased survival of severe burns, and traumatic amputations as the four signature wounds of the current conflicts, and the Independent Review Group report states that the recovery process “can take months or years and must accommodate recurring or delayed manifestations of symptoms, extended rehabilitation and all the life complications that emerge over time from such trauma” .

==(b) Report requirement– ==

Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] , with contributions from the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] , the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] , and the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] , shall submit to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] a report containing an estimate of previous costs of Operation New Dawn (the successor contingency operation to Operation Iraqi Freedom) and the long-term costs of Operation Enduring Freedom for a scenario, determined by the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and based on current contingency operation and withdrawal plans, that takes into account expected force levels and the expected length of time that members of the Armed Forces will be deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
