=Sec. 3. Findings; purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) There is currently no comprehensive system for acquiring accurate data on the incidence of sports- and recreation-related concussions across all youth age groups and sports.
:(2) Overall, according to a report entitled“Sports-Related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing the Culture”, issued by the National Academies in 2013, each year in the United States, there are approximately 1.6 to 3.8 million sports- and recreation-related traumatic brain injuries, including concussions and other head injuries. These figures are based on conservative estimates.
:(3) A review of National Collegiate Athletic Association data for 15 sports showed that the overall reported concussion rate doubled from 1.7 to 3.4 concussions per 1,000 athletic exposures over the past 15 years, covering the 1988–1989 and 2003–2004 academic years.
:(4) Between 2001 and 2009, the reported number of our youth ages 19 and under treated for concussion and other nonfatal, sports- and recreation-related traumatic brain injuries increased from 150,000 to 250,000.
:(5) Over the same time period between 2001 and 2009, the rate of emergency room visits for concussive injuries increased by 57 percent.
:(6) Yet, according to the National Academies there currently is—
::(A) a lack of data to accurately estimate the incidence of sports-related concussions across a variety of sports and for youth across the pediatric age spectrum; and
::(B) no comprehensive system for acquiring accurate data on the incidence of sports- and recreation-related concussions across all youth age groups and sports.
:(7) Currently, there are significant information gaps in the proper protocol for diagnosis and treatment of sports-related concussions and more research desperately is needed.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are—
:(1) to increase awareness and knowledge about concussions through development of, implementation of, and evaluation of the effectiveness of, large-scale collaborative efforts and research by entities including, but not limited to, national sports associations, State high school associations, trainers’ associations, appropriate Federal entities, and other stakeholders such as parents, coaches, and students; and
:(2) to change the culture (including social norms, attitudes, and behaviors) surrounding concussions among elementary school through college-aged youth and their parents, coaches, sports officials, educators, trainers, and health care professionals, taking into account demographic variations across population groups, where appropriate. 

=Sec. 4. Surveillance of sports-related concussions=

  Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after  section 317T of such Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/247b–22 42 U.S.C. 247b–22] )the following:

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]], acting through the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and taking into account other Federal data collection efforts, shall—
:(1) establish and oversee a national system to accurately determine the incidence of sports-related concussions; and
:(2) begin implementation of such system not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of the  Concussion Awareness and Education Act of 2014  .

==(b) Data To Be Collected– ==

The data collected under subsection (a) shall, to the extent feasible, include each of the following:
:(1) The incidence of sports related concussions in individuals 5 through 21 years of age.
:(2) Demographic information of the injured individuals, including age, sex, race, and ethnicity.
:(3) Pre-existing conditions of the injured individuals, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and learning disabilities.
:(4) The concussion history of the injured individuals, such as the number and dates of prior concussions.
:(5) The use of protective equipment and impact monitoring devices.
:(6) The qualifications of personnel diagnosing the concussions.
:(7) The cause, nature, and extent of the concussive injury, including—
::(A) the sport or activity involved;
::(B) the recreational or competitive level of the sport or activity involved;
::(C) the event type involved, including whether it was practice or competition;
::(D) the impact location on the body;
::(E) the impact nature, such as contact with a playing surface, another player, or equipment; and
::(F) signs and symptoms consistent with a concussion. .
