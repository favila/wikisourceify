Pursuant to [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 section 106(6)] , and notwithstanding any other provision of law, any noninteractive services performing sound recordings publicly by means of an audio transmission may collectively negotiate and agree to royalty rates and license terms and conditions for the performance of such sound recordings.

====(2) One-stop licensing for noninteractive services– ====



=====(A) Negotiation of licenses by common agent– =====

Pursuant to [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 section 106(6)] , and notwithstanding any other provision of law, for licenses for noninteractive audio transmissions, SoundExchange, Inc., or any successor entity is designated as the sole common agent to negotiate, agree to, pay, and receive payments under this section. If a license for noninteractive audio transmissions is agreed to by such common agent, copyright owners of sound recordings may subsequently negotiate and agree to royalty rates and license terms and conditions with any noninteractive services performing sound recordings publicly by means of an audio transmission for the performance of such sound recordings.

=====(B) Direct payment and equal compensation– =====

The common agent under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 subparagraph (A)] shall make distributions directly to the following recipients from payments collected under this section as follows:

:(ii) 45 percent shall be paid to featured recording artists.
:(iii) 5 percent shall be paid to nonfeatured musicians and vocalists (through the American Federation of Musicians and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists Intellectual Property Rights Distribution Fund, or their successors).

===(f) Payments from individual licenses for noninteractive audio transmissions– ===

In the case of a license granted by the copyright owner of a sound recording to a noninteractive service performing sound recordings publicly by means of an audio transmission, such service shall pay to the common agent described in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 subsection (e)] receipts from the licensing of such transmissions in an amount equal to 50 percent of the total royalties and other compensation that the service is required to pay for such transmissions under the applicable license agreement. Such common agent shall distribute such payments in proportion to the distributions provided in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 clauses (ii)] and [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114 (iii) of subsection (e)(2)(B)] , and such payments shall be the sole payments to which featured and nonfeatured artists are entitled by reason of such transmissions under the license with that service.

The Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish such rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such rates and terms, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on economic, competitive, and programming information presented by the parties.

====(2) Payment of royalties– ====

All royalty payments under this subsection for over-the-air nonsubscription broadcast transmissions required to be paid by public broadcasting entities that are eligible to receive funding on the basis of the formula set forth in section 396(k)(6)(B) of the Communications Act of 1934( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/396 47 U.S.C. 396(k)(6)(B)] )or that are authorized to transmit over-the-air nonsubscription broadcast performances of nondramatic musical works pursuant to arrangements negotiated or otherwise made by the [[w:|Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/118 section 118] , shall first be made using funds made available pursuant to section 396(k)(3)(A)(I)(II) of the Communications Act of 1934..
