Whereas over 70 percent of the contiguous United States is privately owned;   Whereas the future of the environment is determined by the decisions made by the men and women who own and manage that land, including urban landscapes;   Whereas world population is projected to reach 9,000,000,000 people by 2050;   Whereas increased production will be needed from agricultural land to feed the increasing population;   Whereas meeting these needs will make caring for the environment more difficult; and   Whereas landowners work to ensure they sustain a healthy environment to support abundant wildlife: Now, therefore, be it
