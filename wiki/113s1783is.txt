To enhance public safety by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal prison system with offender risk and needs assessment, individual risk reduction incentives and rewards, and risk and recidivism reduction.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “ Federal Prison Reform Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Purposes=

The purposes of the Act are to—
:(1) increase public safety by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal prison system, and to reduce the recidivism rates of Federal offenders;
:(2) establish offender risk and needs assessment as the cornerstone of a more effective and efficient Federal prison system;
:(3) implement a validated post-sentencing risk and needs assessment system that relies on dynamic risk factors to provide Federal prison officials with guidelines to address the individual criminogenic needs of Federal offenders, manage limited resources, and enhance public safety;
:(4) enhance existing recidivism reduction programs and increase prison jobs and other productive activities by incentivizing Federal prisoners to reduce their individual risk of recidivism by successfully completing such programs, and by successfully maintaining such jobs and activities over time;
:(5) reward all Federal prisoners who successfully complete evidence-based intervention and treatment programs, and maintain prison jobs and other productive activities, with the ability to earn and accrue time credits and additional privileges;
:(6) reward Federal prisoners who successfully reduce their individual risk of recidivism by providing them with the ability to transfer into prerelease custody when they are reassessed as low risk and have earned sufficient time credits;
:(7) expand the implementation of evidence-based intervention and treatment programs designed to reduce recidivism, including educational and vocational training programs, prison jobs, and other productive activities, to ensure that all Federal prisoners have access to them during their entire terms of incarceration;
:(8) perform regular outcome evaluations of programs and interventions to assure that they are evidence-based and to suggest changes and enhancements based on the results; and
:(9) assist the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in addressing the underlying cost structure of the Federal prison system and ensure that the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department]] can continue to run our prisons safely and securely without compromising the scope or quality of the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department’s]] many other critical law enforcement missions.
