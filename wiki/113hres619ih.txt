{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing that cardiovascular disease continues to be an overwhelming threat to women’s health and the importance of providing basic, preventive heart screenings to women wherever they seek primary care.    Whereas heart disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States, causing 1 in 4 female deaths and more deaths than all forms of cancer combined;   Whereas since 1984, the number of deaths from heart disease for women has exceeded those for men;   Whereas the rate of cardiovascular death is increasing by 1 percent each year among women ages 35 to 44;   Whereas heart disease claims the life of nearly 422,000 women each year;   Whereas almost half of all African-American women have some form of cardiovascular disease and are more likely to die from heart disease than White women;   Whereas heart disease and stroke account for $312.6 billion in health care expenditures and lost productivity annually;   Whereas only 54 percent of women recognize that their number one killer is heart disease and almost two-thirds of women who unexpectedly die of heart disease have no previous symptoms of disease;   Whereas many women, especially younger women, may not be aware of their risk for heart disease because they have never gotten a basic, preventive heart screening and have no symptoms;   Whereas studies show that nearly 1 in 5 women rely solely on their OB/GYN for primary care, yet only 35 percent of women recall having even discussed heart disease with their OB/GYN;   Whereas identifying cardiovascular disease risk factors early, such as high blood pressure, smoking, excessive weight and obesity, high cholesterol, and diabetes, allows for more effective intervention and treatment, and can dramatically lower a woman’s overall risk of heart disease and heart attack;   Whereas the burden of women’s heart disease can be reduced in the United States by ensuring that wherever women seek care they get a basic, preventive heart disease screening;   Whereas experts recommend and encourage that a basic, preventive heart screening be a routine part of a woman's visit to a primary care practitioner; and   Whereas once women understand their risk, they also need follow-up information, support, and incentives to maintain cardiovascular health and make the most informed decisions: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]—
:(1) recognizes that despite improved education and awareness, heart disease remains the number one killer of women in the United States and this result is untenable;
:(2) recognizes the importance of early basic, preventive cardiovascular screening for women, wherever they seek primary care, so that all women can know their risks and what can be done to reduce them;
:(3) recognizes that basic, preventive heart disease screenings should be a routine part of women’s health care; and
:(4) commits to improving the heart health of all women, tearing down the barriers that prevent women from getting screened for heart disease, ensuring women are provided with personalized lifestyle modification recommendations and support, and ensuring all women have a healthy heart.
