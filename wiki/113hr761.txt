{{Center|A BILL}}

To require the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to more efficiently develop domestic sources of the minerals and mineral materials of strategic and critical importance to United States economic and national security and manufacturing competitiveness.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013”.

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:
: The industrialization of China and India has driven demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of resource nationalism exemplified by China’s reduction in exports of rare-earth elements necessary for telecommunications, military technologies, healthcare technologies, and conventional and renewable energy technologies.: The availability of minerals and mineral materials are essential for economic growth, national security, technological innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply chain.: The exploration, production, processing, use, and recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic well-being, security and general welfare of the Nation.: The United States has vast mineral resources, but is becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following::: Twenty-five years ago the United States was dependent on foreign sources for 30 nonfuel mineral materials, 6 of which the United States imported 100 percent of the Nation’s requirements, and for another 16 commodities the United States imported more than 60 percent of the Nation’s needs.:: By 2011 the United States import dependence for nonfuel mineral materials had more than doubled from 30 to 67 commodities, 19 of which the United States imported 100 percent of the Nation’s requirements, and for another 24 commodities, imported more than 50 percent of the Nation’s needs.:: The United States share of worldwide mineral exploration dollars was 8 percent in 2011, down from 19 percent in the early 1990s.:: In the 2012 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment, out of 25 major mining countries, the United States ranked last with Papua New Guinea in permitting delays, and towards the bottom regarding government take and social issues affecting mining.
3. Definitions


In this Act:

=(1) Strategic and critical minerals=

The term strategic and critical minerals means minerals that are necessary—: for national defense and national security requirements;: for the Nation’s energy infrastructure, including pipelines, refining capacity, electrical power generation and transmission, and renewable energy production;: to support domestic manufacturing, agriculture, housing, telecommunications, healthcare, and transportation infrastructure; and: for the Nation’s economic security and balance of trade.

=I Development of Domestic Sources of Strategic and Critical Minerals=


=101. Improving development of strategic and critical minerals=

=102. Responsibilities of the lead agency=


==(a) In general==

The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall appoint a project lead who shall coordinate and consult with other agencies, cooperating agencies, project proponents and contractors to ensure that agencies minimize delays, set and adhere to timelines and schedules for completion of reviews, set clear permitting goals and track progress against those goals.
==(b) Determination under NEPA==

The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall determine any such action would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 if the procedural and substantive safeguards of the lead agency’s permitting process alone, any applicable State permitting process alone, or a combination of the two processes together provide an adequate mechanism to ensure that environmental factors are taken into account.
==(c) coordination on permitting and review==

The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall enhance government coordination on permitting and review by avoiding duplicative reviews, minimizing paperwork and engaging other agencies and stakeholders early in the process. The lead agency shall consider the following best practices:: Deferring to and relying upon baseline data, analysis and reviews preformed by State agencies with jurisdiction over the proposed project.: Conducting reviews concurrently rather than sequentially to the extent practicable and when such concurrent review will expedite rather than delay a decision.
==(d) time limits for permit review process==

At the request of a project proponent, the project lead of the agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall enter into an agreement with the project proponent and other cooperating agencies that sets time limits for each part of the permit review process including the following:: The decision on whether to prepare a document required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 .: A determination of the scope of any document required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 .: The scope of and schedule for the baseline studies required to prepare a document required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 .: Preparation of any draft document required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 .: Preparation of a final document required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 .: Consultations required under applicable laws.: Submission and review of any comments required under applicable law.: Publication of any public notices required under applicable law.: A final or any interim decisions.

==(g) Financial assurance==

The lead agency will determine the amount of financial assurance for reclamation of a mineral exploration or mining site, which must cover the estimated cost if the lead agency were to contract with a third party to reclaim the operations according to the reclamation plan, including construction and maintenance costs for any treatment facilities necessary to meet Federal, State or tribal environmental standards.
==(h) Application to existing permit applications==

This section shall apply with respect to a mineral exploration or mine permit for which an application was submitted before the date of the enactment of this Act if the applicant for the permit submits a written request to the lead agency for the permit. The lead agency shall begin implementing this section with respect to such application within 30 days after receiving such written request.
==(i) Strategic and critical materials within National Forests==

With respect to strategic and critical materials within a federally administered unit of the [[Wikipedia:United States Forest Service|National Forest System ]], the lead agency shall—: exempt all areas of identified mineral resources in Land Use Designations, other than Non-Development Land Use Designations, in existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act from the procedures detailed at and all rules promulgated under part 294 of title 36, Code for Federal Regulations;: apply such exemption to all additional routes and areas that the lead agency finds necessary to facilitate the construction, operation, maintenance, and restoration of the areas of identified mineral resources described in paragraph (1) ; and: continue to apply such exemptions after approval of the Minerals Plan of Operations for the unit of the [[Wikipedia:United States Forest Service|National Forest System ]].
