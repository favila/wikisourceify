This Act may be cited as the“   Reducing Disparities Using Care Models and Education Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The Congress finds as follows:
:(1) The infant death rate among African-Americans is more than double that of Whites.
:(2) The death rate for all cancers is 30 percent higher for African-Americans than for Whites; for prostate cancer, it is more than double that for Whites.
:(3) Black women have a higher death rate from breast cancer despite having a mammography screening rate that is nearly the same as the rate for White women.
:(4) Diabetes incidence is highest among Native Americans, at 15.9 percent, followed by 13.2 percent for African-Americans, 12.8 percent for Hispanics, 9.0 percent for Asians, and 7.6 percent for Whites.
:(5) New cases of hepatitis and tuberculosis are higher in Asians and Pacific Islanders living in the United States than in Whites.
:(6) Individuals in same-sex couples were more likely than individuals in different-sex couples to report a delay in getting necessary prescriptions.
:(7) Infants born to Black women are 1.5 to 3 times more likely to die than those born to women of other races or ethnicities, and American Indian and Alaska Native infants die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at nearly 2.5 times the rate of White infants.
:(8) Low-income children have higher rates of mortality (even with the same condition), have higher rates of disability, and are more likely to have multiple conditions.
:(9) White children are half as likely as Black and Latino children not to be in excellent or very good health.
:(10) As of 2012, 38.9 percent of United States adults were obese, with the highest rate among African-Americans at 47.9 percent, followed by Hispanics at 42.5 percent, Whites at 32.6 percent, and Asians at 10.8 percent.
:(11) The risk of stroke is twice as high for African-Americans as for Whites, and African-Americans are more likely to die of stroke. Other ethnic minorities also have higher risk than Whites. Overall, strokes are most prevalent in the Southeast United States, and less so in the Northeast.
:(12) African-Americans accounted for 44 percent of all those infected with HIV, despite being only 12 percent of the United States population.
:(13) Black men who have sex with men (MSM) ages 13 to 24 had the most new infections among youth.
:(14) One study found that among heterosexuals living in the same urban community, those below the poverty line were twice as likely to contract human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
:(15) Persons with less than a high school diploma (6.7 percent) and high school graduates (4.0 percent) were more likely to report major depression than those with at least some college education (2.5 percent).
:(16) Only about 10 percent of physicians practice in rural America despite the fact that nearly one-fourth of the population lives in these areas.
:(17) Rural residents are less likely to have employer-provided health care coverage or prescription drug coverage, and the rural poor are less likely to be covered by Medicaid benefits than their urban counterparts.
:(18) Twenty percent of nonmetropolitan counties lack mental health services versus 5 percent of metropolitan counties.
:(19) Fifteen percent of persons with disabilities report not seeing a doctor due to cost in comparison to 6 percent of the general population.
