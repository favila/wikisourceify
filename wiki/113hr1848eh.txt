To ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration advances the safety of small airplanes, and the continued development of the general aviation industry, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Small Airplane Revitalization Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) A healthy small aircraft industry is integral to economic growth and to maintaining an effective transportation infrastructure for communities and nations around the world.
:(2) Small aircraft comprise nearly 90 percent of [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] type certified general aviation aircraft.
:(3) General aviation provides for the cultivation of a workforce of engineers, manufacturing and maintenance professionals, and pilots, who secure the Nation’s economic success and defense.
:(4) General aviation contributes to well-paying manufacturing and technology jobs in the United States, and these products are exported in great numbers, providing a positive trade balance.
:(5) Technology developed and proven in general aviation aids in the success and safety of all sectors of aviation and scientific competence.
:(6) The average small airplane in the United States is now 40 years old and the regulatory barriers to bringing new designs to market are resulting in a lack of innovation and investment in small airplane design.
:(7) Over the past decade, the United States has typically lost 10,000 active private pilots per year, partially due to a lack of cost-effective, new small airplanes.
:(8) General aviation safety can be improved by modernizing and revamping the regulations for this sector to clear the path for technology adoption and cost-effective means to retrofit the existing fleet with new safety technologies.

=Sec. 3. FAA safety and regulatory improvements for general aviation=



==(a) Establishment of FAA safety and regulatory improvements for general aviation– ==

The [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Administrator]] shall advance the safety and continued development of small airplanes by reorganizing the certification requirements applicable to small airplanes to streamline the approval of safety advancements.

==(b) Regulations– ==

The [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Administrator]] shall issue a final rule based on the [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] ’s Part 23 Reorganization Aviation Rulemaking Committee (established in August 2011) by December 31, 2015. The final rule shall meet the following objectives of the Part 23 Committee:
:(1) Create a regulatory regime for small airplanes that will improve safety and decrease certification costs.
:(2) Set broad, outcome-driven safety objectives that will spur innovation and technology adoption.
:(3) Replace current, prescriptive requirements contained in [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] rules with performance-based regulations.
:(4) Use [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] -accepted consensus standards to clarify how the part 23 safety objectives may be met by specific designs and technologies.

==(c) Consensus-Based standards– ==

The [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Administrator]] shall use acceptable consensus-based standards whenever possible in the spirit of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1996( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/3701 15 U.S.C. 3701note] ), while continuing traditional methods for meeting part 23.

==(d) Safety cooperation– ==

The [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Administrator]] shall lead the effort to improve general aviation safety by working with leading aviation regulators to assist them in adopting a complementary regulatory approach for small airplanes.

=Sec. 4. Definitions=

In this Act, the following definitions apply:

==(1) Administrator– ==

The term “Administrator” means the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.

==(2) Consensus standards– ==

The term “consensus standards” means standards developed by voluntary organizations which plan, develop, establish, or coordinate voluntary standards using agreed-upon procedures, both domestic and international. These standards include provisions requiring that owners of relevant intellectual property agree to make that intellectual property available on a nondiscriminatory, royalty-free or reasonable-royalty basis to all interested parties. These bodies have the attributes of openness, balance of interest, due process, an appeals process, and consensus.

==(3) FAA– ==

The term “FAA” means the Federal Aviation Administration.

==(4) General aviation– ==

The term “general aviation” means all aviation activities other than scheduled commercial airline operations and military aviation.

==(5) Part 23– ==

The term “part 23” means part 23 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.

==(6) Small airplane– ==

The term “small airplane” means [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] type certificated airplanes that meet the parameters of part 23 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.Passed the House of Representatives July 16, 2013.Karen L. Haas,Clerk.
