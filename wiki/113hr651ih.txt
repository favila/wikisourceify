=Sec. 2. Security checks=



==(a) Sense of Congress– ==

Although effective security checks are needed to ensure that the United States and the Nation’s refugee admissions program are adequately protected, it is the sense of the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that the failure to properly coordinate security and non-security clearance procedures has had negative impacts on the processing of vulnerable individuals who are in need of, and eligible for, resettlement to the United States.

The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] shall work with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, including the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] , to conduct a review of refugee processing, including security clearances, with the goal of streamlining processing, consistent with maintaining thorough security vetting.

Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] shall submit to the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] a report on the results of the review conducted under subsection (b). The report shall include a description of recommended changes to streamline processing and the costs associated with any unfunded needs.

:(2) nongovernmental or international organizations with appropriate expertise in developing curriculum and teaching English as a second language.

==(c) Impact on processing times– ==

The [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary]] shall ensure that such training programs occur within applicable processing times and do not unduly delay the departure for the United States of refugees who have been approved for admission to the United States.

==(d) Timeline for implementation– ==



===(1) Initial implementation– ===

Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary]] shall ensure that such training programs are fully and continually operational in at least 3 refugee processing regions.

===(2) Additional implementation– ===

Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary]] shall notify the appropriate congressional committees that such training programs are fully and consistently operational in 5 refugee processing regions.

==(e) GAO report– ==

Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General of the United States]] shall conduct a study on the implementation of this section, including an assessment of the quality of English as a second language curriculum and instruction, the benefits of the work orientation and English as a second language training program to refugees, and recommendations on whether such programs should be continued, broadened, or modified, and shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the findings of such study.
