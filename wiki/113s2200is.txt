====(b) Unauthorized debit card transactions– ====



=====(1) Liability of consumer– =====

A consumer shall be liable for the unauthorized use of a debit card, only if—
:(A) the debit card is an accepted debit card;
:(B) the liability is not in excess of $50;
:(C) the issuer has provided the consumer with a description of a means by which the issuer may be notified of loss or theft of the card;
:(D) the unauthorized use occurs before the issuer has been notified that an unauthorized use of the debit card has occurred or may occur as the result of loss, theft, or otherwise; and
:(E) the issuer has provided a method whereby the user of such card can be identified as the person authorized to use it.

=====(2) Notification– =====

For purposes of this subsection, an issuer has been notified when such steps as may be reasonably required in the ordinary course of business to provide the issuer with the pertinent information have been taken, whether or not any particular officer, employee, or agent of the issuer does in fact receive such information.

=====(3) Burden of proof– =====

In any action by an issuer to enforce liability for the use of a debit card, the burden of proof is upon the issuer to show that the use was authorized or, if the use was unauthorized, then the burden of proof is upon the issuer to show that the conditions of liability for the unauthorized use of a debit card, as set forth in paragraph (1) , have been met.

=====(4) Rule of construction– =====

Nothing in this subsection imposes liability upon a consumer for the unauthorized use of a debit card in excess of his liability for such use under other applicable law or under any agreement with the issuer.

=====(5) Definitions– =====

As used in this subsection, the terms“debit card”and“issuer”have the same meaning as in section 920(c) . .
