{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title XXIX of the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize the program under such title relating to lifespan respite care.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) There are an estimated 62,000,000 family caregivers nationwide that provide care for loved ones with chronic, disabling health conditions across the lifespan.
:(2) The economic value of uncompensated family caregiving to the United States economy was estimated at $450,000,000,000 in 2009, more than total Medicaid spending of $366,000,000,000, including both Federal and State contributions for medical and long-term care in the same year.
:(3) While caring for the aging population remains a growing concern, more than half of care recipients are under age 75, and almost one-third are under age 50.
:(4) Respite provides temporary relief to caregivers from the ongoing responsibility of caring for individuals of all ages with special needs.
:(5) Respite care is the most frequently requested family support service.
:(6) Respite has been shown to provide family caregivers with the relief necessary to maintain their own health, balance work and family, bolster family stability, keep marriages intact, and avoid or delay more costly nursing home or foster care placements.
:(7) Delaying nursing home, institutional, or foster care placement of just one individual for several months can save Medicaid, child welfare, or other government programs tens of thousands of dollars.
:(8) The Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2006 was originally enacted to improve the delivery and quality of respite care services available to families across all age and disability groups by establishing coordinated lifespan respite systems.
:(9) Thirty-one States and the District of Columbia have received grants under the Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2006 to improve the availability and quality of respite services across the lifespan.
:(10) For the Nation’s wounded servicemembers and veterans with traumatic brain injuries and other conditions, respite systems could be an integral lifeline for families in their new roles as lifelong family caregivers.
:(11) The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]have both acknowledged the unique challenges facing caregivers of returning servicemembers and veterans, as well as the need for increased caregiver services.
:(12) The increased utilization of, and costs to, long-term care systems requires the continued development of coordinated family support services like lifespan respite care.
