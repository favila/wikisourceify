An estimate of the remaining net present value of construction costs, as adjusted, shall be provided by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] to the contractor no later than 30 days following receipt of request of the contractor;
:(B) require that construction costs or other capitalized costs incurred after the effective date of the contract or not reflected in the rate schedule referenced in subparagraph (A), and properly assignable to such contractor shall be repaid in not more than 5 years after notification of the allocation if such amount is a result of a collective annual allocation of capital costs to the contractors exercising contract conversation under this subsection of less than $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable reclamation law;

An estimate of the remaining net present value of construction costs, as adjusted, shall be provided by the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] to the contractor no later than 30 days after receipt of request of contractor.
:(B) The contract shall require that construction costs or other capitalized costs incurred after the effective date of the contract or not reflected in the rate schedule referenced in subparagraph (A), and properly assignable to such contractor, shall be repaid in not more than 5 years after notification of the allocation if such amount is a result of a collective annual allocation of capital costs to the contractors exercising contract conversation under this subsection of less than $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable reclamation law; and
