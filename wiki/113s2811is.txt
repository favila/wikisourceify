==(d) Chronic hazard advisory panel– ==



===(1) Appointment– ===

Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:Consumer Product Safety Commission|Commission]]shall appoint a chronic hazard advisory panel pursuant to the procedures of  section 28 of the Consumer Product Safety Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2077 15 U.S.C. 2077])to study the effects on human health of all chemical flame retardants as used in children's products or upholstered furniture.

The panel shall, not later than 540 days after the date on which the panel is appointed under paragraph (1), complete an examination of the potential hazards and exposures for the full range of chemical flame retardants that may be used in children's products or upholstered furniture to meet applicable fire safety standards and shall—
:(i) examine potential health effects of the chemical flame retardants, including—
::(I) developmental toxicity;
::(II) carcinogenicity, genetic damage, or reproductive toxicity;
::(III) endocrine disruption;
::(IV) toxicity related to the nervous system, immune system, or organs or cause other systemic toxicity; and
::(V) whether they are—
:::(aa) persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic; or
:::(bb) very persistent and very bioaccumulative;
:(ii) consider the potential health effects of such chemical flame retardants, both in isolation and in combination with other flame retardants;
:(iii) examine biomonitoring studies that document existing levels and likely future levels of chemical flame retardants in children, pregnant women, firefighters (including combustion by-products of chemical flame retardants), and others;
:(iv) examine data and analysis regarding the chemical flame retardants in household dust, indoor air, or elsewhere in the home environment;
:(v) consider the cumulative effects of total exposure to flame retardants, both from children’s products, upholstered furniture, and from other sources, such as food, commercial furniture, building insulation, and electronics;
:(vi) review all relevant data, including the most recent, best-available, peer-reviewed, scientific studies of these chemical flame retardants that employ objective data collection practices or employ other objective methods;
:(vii) consider the amounts of chemical flame retardants used in consumer products and the total volumes manufactured for use; and
:(viii) consider possible similar health effects of chemical flame retardants used in children's products or upholstered furniture.

===(3) Do novo– ===
