 To define STEM education to include computer science, and to support existing STEM education programs at the National Science Foundation.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   STEM Education Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Definition of STEM education=

For purposes of carrying out STEM education activities at the [[w:National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation]], the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], the [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], the [[w:National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology]], and the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], the term“STEM education”means education in the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including other academic subjects that build on these disciplines such as computer science. 

=Sec. 3. Informal STEM education=



==(a) Grants– ==

The [[w:National Science Foundation|Director of the National Science Foundation]], through the [[w:National Science Foundation|Directorate for Education and Human Resources]], shall continue to award competitive, merit-reviewed grants to support—
:(1) research and development of innovative out-of-school STEM learning and emerging STEM learning environments in order to improve STEM learning outcomes and engagement in STEM; and
:(2) research that advances the field of informal STEM education.

==(b) Uses of funds– ==

Activities supported by grants under this section may encompass a single STEM discipline, multiple STEM disciplines, or integrative STEM initiatives and shall include—
:(1) research and development that improves our understanding of learning and engagement in informal environments, including the role of informal environments in broadening participation in STEM; and
:(2) design and testing of innovative STEM learning models, programs, and other resources for informal learning environments to improve STEM learning outcomes and increase engagement for K–12 students, K–12 teachers, and the general public, including design and testing of the scalability of models, programs, and other resources. 

=Sec. 4. Noyce scholarship program amendments=
