{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the prevention of and response to sexual assault in the Armed Forces by establishing a Sexual Assault Oversight and Response Council and an enhanced Sexual Assault Oversight and Response Office and by requiring the appointment of a Director of Military Prosecutions for sexual-related offenses committed by a member of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Sexual Assault Training Oversight and Prevention Act ”or the“ STOP Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) The [[w:|Department of Defense]]conducted a survey of members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty that revealed that only 13.5 percent of such members reported incidents of sexual assault, which means that more than 19,000 incidents of sexual assault of members of the Armed Forces actually occurred in 2010 alone.
:(2) Despite modest attempts, the [[w:|Department of Defense]]has failed to address the chronic under reporting of incidents of sexual assault and harassment, as by the Department’s own estimates, 86 percent of sexual assaults went unreported in 2010.
:(3) The military adjudication system itself lacks independence, as military judges depend on command, and members of the Armed Forces have only limited access to civilian courts to address their grievances.
:(4) The Cox Commission, sponsored by the National Institute of Military Justice, as well as several other actors, have consistently observed that the United States has fallen behind countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom in terms of its military justice system.
:(5) The military atmosphere is not conducive to resolving issues of sexual assault and harassment, and sexual violence continues to infect the Armed Forces.
:(6) The culture of the United States Armed Forces is based on the chain of command. In a case of sexual assault, a commander may be responsible for both the victim and the offender, or both of their units, or the entire base or ship where the offense occurred. Command discretion empowers a commander to decide if the case goes forward to court martial. The great deference afforded command discretion raises serious concerns about conflicts of interest and the potential for abuse of power.
