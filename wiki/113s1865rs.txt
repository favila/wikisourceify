=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Migratory Bird Habitat Investment and Enhancement Act   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds that—
:(1) Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps (commonly known as duck stamps ) were created in 1934 as Federal licenses required for hunting migratory waterfowl;
:(2) 
::(A) duck stamps are a vital tool for wetland conservation;
::(B) 98 percent of the receipts from duck stamp sales are used to acquire important migratory bird breeding, migration, and wintering habitat, which are added to the National Wildlife Refuge System; and
::(C) those benefits extend to all wildlife, not just ducks;
:(3) since its inception, the Federal duck stamp program has—
::(A) generated more than $750,000,000;
::(B) preserved more than 5,000,000 acres of wetland and wildlife habitat; and
::(C) is considered among the most successful conservation programs ever initiated;
:(4) 
::(A) since 1934, when duck stamps cost $1, the price has been increased 7 times to the price in effect on the date of enactment of this Act of $15, which took effect in 1991; and
::(B) the price of the duck stamp has not increased since 1991, the longest single period without an increase in program history; and
:(5) with the price unchanged during the 20-year period preceding the date of enactment of this Act, duck stamps have lost 40 percent of their value based on the consumer price index, while the [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]reports the price of land in targeted wetland areas has tripled from an average of $306 to $1,091 per acre.
