{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish the National Commission on Effective Marginal Tax Rates for Low-Income Families.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Making Work and Marriage Pay Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The take-home pay of low-income families is subject to reductions from many sources, including the Federal income tax, Social Security payroll taxes, and State income taxes. In addition, eligibility for many Federal and State programs for assistance to working families, such as the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, supplemental nutritional assistance program, housing assistance programs, Federal and State health care programs, child care assistance, and temporary assistance to needy families, is based in part on income levels. The rates at which the benefits from such programs are phased out have the same disposable income reducing effect as escalating marginal tax rates.
:(2) The total effective marginal rate of tax for additional income earned by low-income people can exceed 100 percent and can be a disincentive to working more hours, getting a raise, seeking education toward a more lucrative trade, getting married, or engaging in other economic or social activities.
:(3)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has enacted each of these programs without full consideration of the impact it would have on other existing programs. As a result, the structure of the United States system for the support of low-income families is uncoordinated and contains features which work against the goal of encouraging families to work their way toward self-sufficiency.

==(1) Low-income– ==
