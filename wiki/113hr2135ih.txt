{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Public Health Service Act to clarify liability protections regarding emergency use of automated external defibrillators.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Establishing a nationally uniform baseline of protection from civil liability for persons who use automated external defibrillators (in this section referred to as “AEDs” ) in perceived medical emergencies, who own or hold other property interests in AEDs used in perceived medical emergencies, or who own, occupy, or manage premises in which an AED is used or from which an AED is taken for use in a perceived medical emergency will encourage the deployment of additional AEDs, which will ultimately save lives that would otherwise have been lost to cardiac arrest.
:(2) The current patchwork of State “Good Samaritan” laws provides incomplete, inconsistent, and, in some instances, inadequate protection for entities considering the acquisition or deployment of AEDs. In these circumstances, concerns about potential liability resulting from the good-faith acquisition and deployment of this life-saving technology are inhibiting its deployment.
:(3) Such concerns are especially acute for entities with operations or facilities in multiple States, yet such entities are also among those in which the widespread deployment of AEDs would be most beneficial.
:(4) A nationally uniform baseline of protection from civil liability is needed for persons who use AEDs in perceived medical emergencies, who own or hold other property interests in AEDs used in perceived medical emergencies, or who own, occupy, or manage premises in which an AED is used or from which an AED is taken for use in a perceived medical emergency.

=Sec. 3. Liability regarding emergency use of automated external defibrillators=

 Section 248 of the Public Health Service Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/238q 42 U.S.C. 238q] )is amended to read as follows:

<blockquote>
