{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title 10, United States Code, to permit additional retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability to receive both disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired pay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related Special Compensation and to eliminate the phase-in period under current law with respect to such concurrent receipt.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Retired Pay Restoration Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings and sense of Congress=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled military retirees were required to fund their own veterans’ disability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned retired pay for each dollar received in veterans’ disability compensation.
:(2) Since 1999, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has enacted legislation to progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of the retired pay disability offset and reduce the burden of financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.
:(3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for all disabled retirees, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has given initial priority to easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled and for combat-disabled retirees.
:(4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost constraints, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] effectively has authorized full concurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent disability ratings and all qualifying retirees with combat-related disability ratings, while phasing out the disability offset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90 percent.
:(5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new thresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting those new thresholds.
:(6)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] is not content with the status quo.

==(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that military retired pay earned by service and sacrifice in defending the United States should not be reduced because a military retiree is also eligible for veterans’ disability compensation awarded for service-connected disability.

=Sec. 3. Eligibility for payment of both retired pay and veterans’ disability compensation for certain additional military retirees with compensable service-connected disabilities=
