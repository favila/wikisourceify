{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of October 6, 2013, through October 10, 2013, as American College of Surgeons Days and recognizing the 100th anniversary of the founding of the organization.    Whereas the American College of Surgeons is the largest surgical organization in the world and remains steadfast in its mission to improve the care of the surgical patient and to safeguard standards of care in an optimal and ethical practice environment;   Whereas the American College of Surgeons continues its work into the 21st century to sustain and develop relevant programs that are inspired by quality;   Whereas the 100th anniversary celebrations serve as a testament that the American College of Surgeons is fulfilling its mission of engaging surgeons as leaders and educators, and developing initiatives that improve surgery and the quality of care for surgical patients;   Whereas the 2013 American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress is the most prestigious international surgical conference which brings together thousands of Fellows of the College and other health care professionals who each year rely on the Clinical Congress to learn about the latest surgical advances, practice management methods, and health policy issues; and   Whereas October 6, 2013, through October 10, 2013, would be appropriate dates to designate as American College of Surgeons Days to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the American College of Surgeons whose achievements continue to significantly influence the course of surgery in the United States and around the world, and was established as an advocate for all surgical patients: Now, therefore, be it
