=={{anchor|H5102F71F57A7460EB14FF02B8FB4DB3E}}Sec. 401. Findings==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Immigration law allows citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence to bring foreign family members to the United States on the basis of immediate relative status or a preference classification.
:(2) Immediate relative status and preference classifications are obtained by filing petitions with the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] .
:(3) For national security purposes, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] conducts background checks on the beneficiaries of such petitions and, since September 11, 2001, on the petitioners as well.
:(4) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) has determined that, in fiscal year 2005, at least 398 of the petitioners who filed family-based visa petitions were on the National Sex Offender Registry maintained by the [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigations]] .
:(5)  [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] was only able to ascertain the nature of the sex offense for 194 of the 398 petitioners.

In evaluating a petitioner who has filed a petition for a spouse, consideration should be given to indications of how well the petitioner and the spouse know each other. Petitions filed on the basis of marriages between men and women who have had little direct, personal contact with each other should be viewed with suspicion. In cases where the petitioner and the spouse have had little direct, personal contact with each other, evidence should be submitted to establish that they have gotten to know each other in some other way.

===={{anchor|H1C5DC83B307648A980164C221753E8B0}}(3) Rebuttal– ====

If the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] intends to deny a petition under paragraph (1), the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] shall provide the petitioner with a notice that states the reasons for the intended denial and provides the petitioner with at least 90 days to submit rebuttal evidence.
