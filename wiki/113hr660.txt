{{Center|1st Session}}


{{Center|H. R. 660}}


{{Center|IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES}}


{{Center|February 13, 2013}}


{{Center|
[[Wikipedia:Barbara Lee|Ms. Lee of California ]]introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[Wikipedia:United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]}}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Public Health Service Act to create a National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium to provide grants and coordinate research with respect to the causes of, and risk factors associated with, neuromyelitis optica, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium Act”.

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:
: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a devastating neurologic disease leading to blindness and paralysis.: There are an estimated 11,000 patients with NMO in the United States.: Women are affected 7 to 9 times more than men, and a large proportion of NMO patients are African-American.: The average age at diagnosis is 41 years, but the range is broad and includes children as young as 2 years of age and adults as old as 89 years of age.: NMO incurs substantial costs for affected patients and their families.: The cause of NMO is unknown, but it is hypothesized to be autoimmune in nature.: More than 90 percent of NMO patients will suffer recurrent disease and accumulate neurologic disability.: Because of their relatively low overall incidence, orphan diseases like NMO frequently do not receive sufficient attention and research funding.: No single institution has a sufficient number of patients to independently conduct research that will adequately address the cause of NMO.: There has been no comprehensive study analyzing all relevant clinical, biological, and epidemiological aspects of NMO to identify potential risk factors and biomarkers for NMO.: We can apply our understanding of NMO to the study of other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
3. Sense of congress


It is the sense of [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]that there is a need—
: to establish and coordinate a multicenter research effort based on collaboration between regional consortia and governmental and nongovernmental entities in order to—:: comprehensively study the causes of NMO; and:: identify potential biomarkers of disease activity; and: to encourage a collaborative effort among academic medical centers with epidemiological study groups to gather comprehensive and detailed information for each patient enrolled in those groups, in order to investigate environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors with respect to, and the pathological and epidemiological characteristics of, NMO.
4. Establishment of the national neuromyelitis optica consortium


Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 284 et seq. ) is amended by adding after section 409J the following new section:


<blockquote>

409K. National neuromyelitis optica consortium


=(a) Establishment of the national neuromyelitis optica consortium=


==(1) In general==

Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this section, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]], acting through the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|Director of NIH ]], and in coordination with the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|Director of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities ]], shall establish, administer, and coordinate a [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium ]](in this section referred to as the “NNO Consortium ”) for the purposes described in paragraph (2) .
==(2) Purposes==

The purposes of the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|NNO Consortium ]]shall be the following:: Providing grants of not fewer than 5 years duration to eligible consortia for the purpose of conducting research with respect to the causes of, and the risk factors and biomarkers associated with, NMO.: Assembling a panel of experts to provide, with respect to research funded by the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|NNO Consortium ]], ongoing guidance and recommendations for the development of the following::: A common study design.:: Standard protocols, methods, procedures, and assays for collecting from individuals enrolled as study participants a minimum dataset that includes the following:::: Complete medical history.::: Neurologic examination.::: Biospecimens, including blood, spinal fluid, DNA, and RNA.::: Radiological data including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).:: Specific analytical methods for examining data.:: Provisions for consensus review of enrolled cases.:: An integrated data collection network.: Designating a central laboratory to collect, analyze, and aggregate data with respect to research funded by the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|NNO Consortium ]]and to make such data and analysis available to researchers.
==(3) Eligible consortia==

To be eligible for a grant under this section, a consortium shall demonstrate the following:: The consortium has the capability to enroll as research participants a minimum of 25 individuals with a diagnosis of NMO from the consortium’s designated catchment area.: The designated catchment area of the consortium does not overlap with the designated catchment area of another consortium already receiving a grant under this section.
==(4) Report==

Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this section and annually thereafter, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]], acting through the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|Director of NIH ]], shall submit to [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]a report with respect to the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|NNO Consortium ]], to be made publicly available, including a summary of research funded by the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|NNO Consortium ]]and a list of consortia receiving grants through the [[Wikipedia:National Institutes of Health|NNO Consortium ]]. At the discretion of the [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary ]], such report may be combined with other similar or existing reports.
==(5) Authorization of appropriations==


===(A) In general===

There is authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018 , to remain available until expended, to carry out this section.
===(B) Sense of congress===

It is the sense of [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]that funds appropriated to carry out this section should be in addition to funds otherwise available or appropriated to carry out the activities described in this section.
=(b) Definitions=

For purposes of this section:
==(1) Catchment area==

The term “catchment area ”means a defined area for which population data are available.
==(2) Consortium==

The term “consortium ”means a partnership of 2 or more universities, health care organizations, or government agencies, or any combination of such entities, serving a designated catchment area..
