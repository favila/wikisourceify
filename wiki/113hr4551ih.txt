===(A) In general– ===

At the request of a State acting through the State Lead Agency, the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary]]shall authorize the State to allow qualified organizations, as defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , and organized for one or more of the purposes described in section 170(h)(4)(A) of that Code , to acquire, hold, and manage conservation easements, using funds granted to the State under this subsection, for purposes of the Forest Legacy Program in the State.

===(B) Eligibility– ===

To be eligible to acquire and manage conservation easements under this paragraph, a qualified organization described in subparagraph (A) must demonstrate to the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary]]the abilities necessary to acquire, monitor, and enforce interests in forestland consistent with the Forest Legacy Program and the assessment of need for the State.

===(C) Reversion– ===

If the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary]], or a State acting through the State Lead Agency, makes any of the determinations described in subparagraph (D) with respect to a conservation easement acquired by a qualified organization under the authority of subparagraph (A) —
:(i) all right, title, and interest of the qualified organization in and to the conservation easement shall terminate; and
