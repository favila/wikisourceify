==Title II— Regulatory Flexibility Improvement==



==Sec. 201. Short title==

This title may be cited as the “ Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act of 2013” .

==Sec. 202. Findings==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical to the recovery of the economy of the United States.
:(2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of small entities to create new jobs.
:(3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a global marketplace.
:(4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to recognize and take account of the differences in the scale and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances have failed to do so.
:(5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal Register, and, according to research by the [[w:Small Business Administration|Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]] , the annual cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 percent more per employee than larger firms in annual regulatory compliance costs.
:(6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically review existing regulations to determine their impact on small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.
:(7) It is the intention of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to amendchapter 6of title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking process and that the agencies assess a full range of alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job loss.

==Sec. 203. Including indirect economic impact in small entity analyses==

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/601 Section 601of title 5, United States Code] , is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>
:(9) the term economic impact means, with respect to a proposed or final rule—
::(A) the economic effects on small entities directly regulated by the rule; and
::(B) the reasonably foreseeable economic effects of the rule on small entities that—
:::(i) purchase products or services from, sell products or services to, or otherwise conduct business with entities directly regulated by the rule;
:::(ii) are directly regulated by other governmental entities as a result of the rule; or
:::(iii) are not directly regulated by the agency as a result of the rule but are otherwise subject to other agency regulations as a result of the rule..
</blockquote>


==Sec. 204. Judicial review to allow small entities to challenge proposed regulations==

<blockquote>
::(3) A small entity may seek such review during the 1-year period beginning on the date of final agency action, except that—
:::(A) if a provision of law requires that an action challenging a final agency action be commenced before the expiration of 1 year, the lesser period shall apply to an action for judicial review under this section; and
:::(B) in the case of noncompliance with [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/603 section 603] or [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/605 605(b)] , a small entity may seek judicial review of agency compliance with such section before the close of the public comment period.; and

::(A) in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/611 subparagraph (A)] , by striking “, and” and inserting a semicolon;
