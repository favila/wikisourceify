{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing June 19, 2014, as this year’s observance of the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day.    Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier areas of the United States, and in particular the Southwestern States, for more than 21⁄2years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which was issued on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of the Civil War;   Whereas on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free;   Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 19th, commonly known as “Juneteenth Independence Day”, as the anniversary of their emancipation;   Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest continue the tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as inspiration and encouragement for future generations;   Whereas for more than 145 years, Juneteenth Independence Day celebrations have been held to honor African-American freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for all cultures; and   Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by former slaves remains an example for all people of the United States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now, therefore, be it
