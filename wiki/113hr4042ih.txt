=Sec. 3. Study of the appropriate capital for mortgage servicing assets=



==(a) In general– ==

The Federal banking agencies shall, jointly, conduct a study of the appropriate capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets for nonsystemic banking institutions.

==(b) Issues To be studied– ==

The study required by this section shall include, with a specific focus on nonsystemic banking institutions—
:(1) the risk to insured depository institutions of holding mortgage servicing assets;
:(2) the history of the market for mortgage servicing assets, including particularly the market for such assets in the period of the financial crisis;
:(3) the ability of insured depository institutions to establish a value for their mortgage servicing assets through periodic sales or other means;
:(4) regulatory approaches to mortgage servicing assets in addition to capital requirements that could be used to address concerns about the value of and ability to sell mortgage servicing assets;
:(5) the impact of imposing the Basel III capital requirements on nonsystemic banking institutions on their ability to compete in the mortgage servicing business, including the need for economies of scale to compete in that business, and on their ability to provide service to consumers to whom they have made a mortgage loan;
:(6) an analysis of what the mortgage servicing marketplace would look like if the Basel III capital requirements on mortgage servicing assets were fully implemented;
:(7) the significance of problems with mortgage servicing assets, if any, in insured depository institution failures and problem insured depository institutions, including specifically identifying failed insured depository institutions where mortgage servicing assets contributed to the failure; and
:(8) an analysis of the relevance of the Basel III capital requirements on mortgage servicing assets to the banking systems of other significant developed countries.

==(c) Report to Congress– ==

Not later than the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal banking agencies shall issue a report to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate]]and the [[w:United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives]]containing—
:(1) the results of the study required under subsection (a) ; and
:(2) any analysis on the specific issue of mortgage servicing assets undertaken by the Federal banking agencies prior to finalizing regulations implementing the Basel III capital requirements. 

=Sec. 4. Delay of rulemaking=



==(a) Rules on mortgage servicing assets– ==

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no regulation to implement the Basel III capital requirements with respect to mortgage servicing assets for nonsystemic banking institutions shall take effect before the end of the 6-month period beginning on the date the report is issued under section 3(c) .

==(b) Final rule requirements– ==

Before any final rule is issued by a Federal banking agency with respect to capital requirements on mortgage servicing assets for nonsystemic banking institutions, the Federal banking agency shall—
:(1) if the related proposed rule was issued before the date on which the report is issued under section 3(c) , issue a new proposed rule for public comment; and
:(2) consider regulatory approaches to mortgage servicing assets that could address concerns about the value of and ability to sell mortgage servicing assets.
