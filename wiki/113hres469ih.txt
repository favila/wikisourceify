 Supporting the scope and objectives of Greece’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union.    Whereas Greece holds the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2014;   Whereas the rotating European Union Presidency offers member states the opportunity to showcase their vision for the European Union, to advance the Union's ongoing work agenda, influence European Union policy and legislation, and broaden the understanding of the European Union amongst the citizens of their country;   Whereas the European Union has established an area of freedom, security, and justice, extending stability and peace to the European continent and its neighbors;   Whereas the United States has supported the European integration process and has consistently supported the objective of European unity and the enlargement of the European Union as a vehicle for prosperity, peace, and democracy;   Whereas the Government of Greece has prioritized growth, job creation, European Union and Eurozone integration, as well as borders, mobility, migration, and integrated European Union Maritime Policy as the main areas of focus for the Greek Presidency of the Council of the European Union;   Whereas the United States and the European Union are each other's largest trading and investment partners, responsible for creating up to an estimated 14,000,000 jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and as such major stakeholders in each other's economic recoveries;   Whereas the Greek Presidency aims at reinforcing efforts that should be focused on reforms aiming at safeguarding stability and revitalizing growth;   Whereas the Greek Presidency aims at promoting synergies in sectors that create jobs such as transport, shipping, tourism, innovation;   Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the United States in bringing political stability and economic development;   Whereas Greece continues to play an important role in the wider European region, including the Eastern Mediterranean;   Whereas Greece, as a traditional maritime country, acknowledges the great potential and opportunity that marine and maritime activities hold for the European Union economy as a whole, especially in the areas of security and energy;   Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to support and enhance Europe’s energy security;   Whereas the Governments of Greece and the United States are at the forefront of efforts to advance freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and respect for human rights; and   Whereas the Hellenic values and principles of Greek-Americans have contributed greatly to United States society, history, and politics: Now, therefore, be it
