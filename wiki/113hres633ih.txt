{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House with respect to accountability for mismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs.    Whereas revelations in 2013 unveiled a pattern of inefficiency and misconduct at [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]Medical Clinics (VAMC) across the country;   Whereas the [[w:Inspector General|Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Inspector General]]conducted interviews with [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]employees and inspected [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]facilities across the country;   Whereas on June 9, 2014, the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]released an initial audit of [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]medical centers across the country, conducted by the [[w:Inspector General|VA Inspector General]], detailing a pattern of mismanagement;   Whereas the [[w:Inspector General|Inspector General]]’s audit found that VAMC scheduling staff were pressured by [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]management“to utilize inappropriate practices in order to make waiting times appear more favorable”;   Whereas the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]will undergo a review to determine why“some front-line, middle, and senior managers felt compelled to manipulate the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]’s scheduling process”;   Whereas in at least two instances, survey participants believed someone, other than a scheduler, was“routinely accessing records and changing desired dates in order to improve performance measures”;   Whereas respondents felt“threatened or coerced”to alter patient appointment dates and reported having been“sanctioned or punished over scheduling practices for not complying with supervisors’ orders to inappropriately enter or alter recorded desired dates”; and   Whereassection 600.1of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, directs the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]]to appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that— 
:(1)  “criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted”; 
:(2)  “investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney’s Office or litigating Division of the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]would present a conflict of interest for the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]]or other extraordinary circumstances”; and 
:(3)  “under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter”: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House]]that—
:(1) actions by [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]officials represent a clear violation of the public’s trust for the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]]to provide access to quality health care for our Nation’s veterans and warrant criminal investigation;
:(2) the ability of the [[w:Veterans Health Administration|Administration]]to objectively investigate its own wrongdoing warrants a Special Counsel to determine whether mismanagement and misconduct at the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]]was criminal; and
:(3) the appointment of a Special Counsel would be in the public interest.
