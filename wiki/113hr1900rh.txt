   Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/717f 15 U.S.C. 717f]  ) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

<blockquote> 
:(i) 
::(1) The [[w:|Commission]]shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a prefiled project not later than 12 months after receiving a complete application that is ready to be processed, as defined by the [[w:|Commission]]by regulation.
::(2) The agency responsible for issuing any license, permit, or approval required under Federal law in connection with a prefiled project for which a certificate of public convenience and necessity is sought under this Act shall approve or deny the issuance of the license, permit, or approval not later than 90 days after the [[w:|Commission]]issues its final environmental document relating to the project.
::(3) The [[w:|Commission]]may extend the time period under paragraph (2) by 30 days if an agency demonstrates that it cannot otherwise complete the process required to approve or deny the license, permit, or approval, and therefor will be compelled to deny the license, permit, or approval.

The [[w:|Commission]]shall incorporate into the terms of such license, permit, or approval any conditions proffered by the agency described in paragraph (2) that the [[w:|Commission]]does not find are inconsistent with the final environmental document.
::(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term“prefiled project”means a project for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a natural gas pipeline with respect to which a prefiling docket number has been assigned by the [[w:|Commission]]pursuant to a prefiling process established by the [[w:|Commission]]for the purpose of facilitating the formal application process for obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity. .
