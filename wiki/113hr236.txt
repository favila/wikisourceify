        Subsections (e)
 and (f) of
			 section 923 of title 18, United States Code
, are amended to read as
			 follows:
(e)
The [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney
				General]] may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend or revoke any
				license issued under this section, or may subject the licensee to a civil
				penalty of not more than $10,000 per violation, if the holder of the license
				has willfully violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation
				prescribed by the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] under this chapter or fails to have secure
				gun storage or safety devices available at any place in which firearms are sold
				under the license to persons who are not licensees (except that in any case in
				which a secure gun storage or safety device is temporarily unavailable because
				of theft, casualty loss, consumer sales, backorders from a manufacturer, or any
				other similar reason beyond the control of the licensee, the dealer shall not
				be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make available such a
				device). The [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] may, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
				suspend or revoke the license of, or assess a civil penalty of not more than
				$10,000 on, a dealer who willfully transfers armor piercing ammunition. The
				[[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] may at any time compromise, mitigate, or remit the liability
				with respect to any willful violation of this chapter or any rule or regulation
				prescribed by the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] under this chapter. The [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General’s]]
				actions under this subsection may be reviewed only as provided in subsection
				(f)
.

(f)
(1)
Any person whose
				application for a license is denied and any holder of a license which is
				suspended or revoked or who is assessed a civil penalty shall receive a written
				notice from the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] stating specifically the grounds upon which
				the application was denied or upon which the license was suspended or revoked
				or the civil penalty assessed. Any notice of a suspension or revocation of a
				license shall be given to the holder of the license before the effective date
				of the suspension or revocation.

(2)
If the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] denies an
				application for a license, or suspends or revokes a license, or assesses a
				civil penalty, the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall, upon request by the aggrieved party,
				promptly hold a hearing to review the denial, suspension, revocation, or
				assessment. In the case of a suspension or revocation of a license, the
				[[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall, on the request of the holder of the license, stay the
				effective date of the suspension or revocation. A hearing under this paragraph
				shall be held at a location convenient to the aggrieved party.

(3)
If after a hearing held under
				paragraph (2)
 the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] decides not to reverse the decision to deny
				an application or suspend or revoke a license or assess a civil penalty, the
				[[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall give notice of the decision to the aggrieved party. The
				aggrieved party may at any time within 60 days after the date notice is given
				under this paragraph file a petition with the United States district court for
				the district in which party resides or in which the party’s principal place of
				business is located for a de novo judicial review of the denial, suspension,
				revocation, or assessment. In a proceeding conducted under this subsection, the
				court may consider any evidence submitted by the parties to the proceeding
				whether or not such evidence was considered at the hearing held under paragraph
				(2)
. If the court decides that the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] was not authorized to deny
				the application or to suspend or revoke the license or to assess the civil
				penalty, the court shall order the [[United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] to take such action as may
				be necessary to comply with the judgment of the
				court.
