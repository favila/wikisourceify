:::(A) such individual is entitled to benefits under section 223 , and
:::(B) such individual is entitled for such month to unemployment compensation,the total of the individual's benefits under section 223 for such month and of any benefits under section 202 for such month based on the individual's wages and self-employment income shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the total amount of unemployment compensation received by such individual for such month.
::(2) The reduction of benefits under paragraph (1) shall also apply to any past-due benefits under section 223 for any month in which the individual was entitled to—
:::(A) benefits under such section, and
:::(B) unemployment compensation.
::(3) The reduction of benefits under paragraph (1) shall not apply to any benefits under section 223 for any month, or any benefits under section 202 for such month based on the individual's wages and self-employment income for such month, if the individual is entitled for such month to unemployment compensation following a period of trial work (as described in section 222(c)(1) , participation in the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program established under section 1148 , or participation in any other program that is designed to encourage an individual entitled to benefits under section 223 or 202 to work.
:(b) If any unemployment compensation is payable to an individual on other than a monthly basis (including a benefit payable as a lump sum to the extent that it is a commutation of, or a substitute for, such periodic compensation), the reduction under this section shall be made at such time or times and in such amounts as the [[w:Social Security Administration|Commissioner of Social Security]] (referred to in this section as the Commissioner ) determines will approximate as nearly as practicable the reduction prescribed by subsection (a) .

:::(A) whether the individual has filed or intends to file any claim for unemployment compensation, and
:::(B) if the individual has filed a claim, whether there has been a decision on such claim.
::(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) , the [[w:Social Security Administration|Commissioner]] may, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, rely upon a certification by the individual that the individual has not filed and does not intend to file such a claim, or that the individual has so filed and no final decision thereon has been made, in certifying benefits for payment pursuant to section 205(i) .
:(e) Whenever a reduction in total benefits based on an individual's wages and self-employment income is made under this section for any month, each benefit, except the disability insurance benefit, shall first be proportionately decreased, and any excess of such reduction over the sum of all such benefits other than the disability insurance benefit shall then be applied to such disability insurance benefit.
:(f) 
::(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the head of any Federal agency shall provide such information within its possession as the [[w:Social Security Administration|Commissioner]] may require for purposes of making a timely determination of the amount of the reduction, if any, required by this section in benefits payable under this title, or verifying other information necessary in carrying out the provisions of this section.
::(2) The [[w:Social Security Administration|Commissioner]] is authorized to enter into agreements with States, political subdivisions, and other organizations that administer unemployment compensation, in order to obtain such information as the [[w:Social Security Administration|Commissioner]] may require to carry out the provisions of this section.
:(g) For purposes of this section, the term unemployment compensation has the meaning given that term in  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/85 section 85(b)]of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 , and the total amount of unemployment compensation to which an individual is entitled shall be determined prior to any applicable reduction under State law based on the receipt of benefits under section 202 or 223 . .
