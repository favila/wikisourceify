{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 A resolution commemorating the life and service of Benedict XVI, Pope Emeritus, and congratulating Pope Francis on his election as Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.    Whereas Benedict XVI, Pope Emeritus, a man of monumental courage and humility, whose unceasing love and devotion to the ministry of Christ helped steward the Catholic Church and the faithful through the daunting challenges of the 21st century;   Whereas Benedict leaves behind an enduring legacy, both as renowned theologian and kind-hearted leader who balanced the august splendor of the papacy with a gentle humanity, and masterfully communicated the timeless morality of the Church in a crusade against the modern evils of relativism, materialism, and consumerism;   Whereas the election to the papacy of His Holiness Pope Francis, formerly Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, marks a groundbreaking moment in the life of the Catholic Church, elevating a marvelous suitor to lead the world’s largest apostolic Christian ministry;   Whereas Pope Francis has inspired a vibrant sense of reform and spiritual renewal in the Church, representing the first pontiff born in the New World, the first hailing from Latin America, and the first prelate ordained in the renowned Society of Jesus or Jesuits;   Whereas the Pope’s chosen regnal name of Francis, after St. Francis of Assisi, as well as his unrivaled reputation as a personally devoted minister to the needs of the poor and outcast, emphasizes the opportunities and obligations of mankind to serve a missionary role in advancing peace, social justice, and moral contemplation for the betterment of all God’s children;   Whereas as President of the Argentine Episcopal Conference, Pope Francis’ experience as spiritual guide and premiere pastoral administrator of one of the Holy See’s largest and most active diocese reveals his unique ability to accomplish much needed reforms in the Vatican and sustain a growing Church in the world’s developing communities in Latin America, Africa, and Asia; and   Whereas Pope Francis’ striking humility and simple gentleness empowers him to connect with and renew the hearts of the faithful and heal the recent wounds of the Church: Now, therefore, be it
