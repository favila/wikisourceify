{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating April 23, 2013 as National Adopt a Library Day .    Whereas libraries are an essential part of the communities and the national education system of the United States;   Whereas the availability of books and services provided by libraries are vital to the happiness, livelihood, and prosperity of the families and communities of the United States;   Whereas the people of the United States benefit significantly from libraries that serve as an open place for people of all ages and backgrounds to use books and other resources that offer pathways to learning, self-discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge;   Whereas libraries in the United States depend on the generous donations and support of individuals and groups to ensure that people who are unable to purchase books still have access to a wide variety of resources;   Whereas certain nonprofit organizations facilitate the donation of books to schools and libraries across the United States to extend the joy of reading to millions of people in the United States and to prevent used books from being thrown away;   Whereas libraries in the United States have provided valuable resources to people who are affected by the economic crisis by encouraging continued education and job training;   Whereas libraries are increasingly being used as a resource for people seeking the tools and information necessary to enter or reenter the workforce; and   Whereas several States that recognize the importance of libraries and reading have adopted resolutions commemorating April 23 as Adopt a Library Day : Now, therefore, be it
