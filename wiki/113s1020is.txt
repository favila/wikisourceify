===(a) Energy performance requirement for Federal buildings– ===



====(1) Requirement– ====

Subject to paragraph (2), each agency shall apply energy conservation measures to, and shall improve the design for the construction of, the Federal buildings of the agency (including each industrial or laboratory facility) so that the energy consumption per gross square foot of the Federal buildings of the agency in fiscal years 2006 through 2020 is reduced, as compared with the energy consumption per gross square foot of the Federal buildings of the agency in fiscal year 2003, by the percentage specified in the following table:PercentageFiscal YearReduction200622007420089200912201015201118201221201324201427201530201633201736201839201942202045.

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), effective beginning on the date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of the All-Of-The-Above Federal Building Energy Conservation Act of 2013, and annually thereafter, each energy manager shall complete, for each calendar year, a comprehensive energy and water evaluation and recommissioning or retrocommissioning for approximately 25 percent of the facilities of each agency that meet the criteria under paragraph (2)(B)in a manner that ensures that an evaluation of each facility is completed at least once every 4 years.

=====(B) Exceptions– =====

An evaluation and recommissioning shall not be required under subparagraph (A)with respect to a facility that—
:(i) has had a comprehensive energy and water evaluation during the 8-year period preceding the date of the evaluation;
:(ii) 
::(I) has been commissioned, recommissioned, or retrocommissioned during the 10-year period preceding the date of the evaluation; or
::(II) is under ongoing commissioning;
:(iii) has not had a major change in function or use since the previous evaluation and commissioning;
:(iv) has been benchmarked with public disclosure under paragraph (8)within the year preceding the evaluation; and
:(v) 
::(I) based on the benchmarking, has achieved at a facility level the most recent cumulative energy savings target under subsection (a)compared to the earlier of—
:::(aa) the date of the most recent evaluation; or
:::(bb) the date—
::::(AA) of the most recent commissioning, recommissioning, or retrocommissioning; or
::::(BB) on which ongoing commissioning began; or
::(II) has a long-term contract in place guaranteeing energy savings at least as great as the energy savings target under subclause (I).

====(4) Implementation of identified energy and water efficiency measures– ====



=====(A) In general– =====

Not later than 2 years after the date of completion of each evaluation under paragraph (3), each energy manager may—
:(i) implement any energy- or water-saving measure that the Federal agency identified in the evaluation conducted under paragraph (3)that is life-cycle cost effective; and
:(ii) bundle individual measures of varying paybacks together into combined projects.

=====(B) Measures not implemented– =====

The energy manager shall, as part of the certification system under paragraph (7), explain the reasons why any life-cycle cost effective measures were not implemented under subparagraph (A)using guidelines developed by the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]] .; and
</blockquote>

::(D) in paragraph (7)(C), by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>

====(iii) Summary report– ====
