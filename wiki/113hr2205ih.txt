={{anchor|HA905154D713549AB8686D69E3291A4DC}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) locally organized and controlled entities that are linked together through a national program office have the ability to lead cost-effective projects and programs that are responsive to community needs and essential to improving the local environment, economy, and quality of life;
:(2) local community involvement with how land is being used is an essential component to the economic success of a neighborhood;
:(3) underutilized and neglected vacant lands significantly erode nearby property values and burden municipal tax bases;
:(4) landscaping and maintenance, especially when local citizens are involved in the process, decreases negative stigma and generates civic pride, which in turn significantly reduces vandalism and illicit activities typically associated with idle lands;
:(5) cleaning, landscaping, and tree planting within vacant and abandoned land and brownfields adds economic value to a community through increased occupancy rates, and improved sales appeal of nearby residential and commercial real estate; and
:(6) the transformation of idle lands and brownfields into cleaner, greener, community assets has been exemplified by a network of federally backed Groundwork USA Trusts for over 8 years.
