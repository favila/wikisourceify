={{anchor|H4DC4C2B0746F499393B83BCB4D635AA3}}Sec. 3. Required provisions of a balanced budget constitutional amendment=

A Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment, to comply with the requirements of section 2, above, must include the following provisions:
:(1) Total outlays of the United States for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States except those for repayment of debt principal. The United States shall have no fiscal year deficits except pursuant to the terms of the Amendment.
:(2) The fiscal year deficit prohibition described herein may be suspended by a majority of the membership of both houses of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , by rollcall vote, for any fiscal year in which the United States is actively engaged in military conflict pursuant to a war declared by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] pursuant to article I, section 8, or may be suspended by four-fifths of the membership of Congress, by rollcall vote, for any other fiscal year.
:(3) In any fiscal year in which [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] does not suspend the Amendment pursuant to its terms and in which total outlays will or may exceed total receipts, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] shall take such steps as are necessary to ensure total outlays for that fiscal year do not exceed total receipts. The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] may not order any increase in taxes or other revenue measures to enforce the Amendment. A [[w:Executive Office of the President|President’s]] failure to prevent a prohibited fiscal year deficit is an impeachable offense.
:(4) Any Member of Congress and any Governor or Attorney General of any State shall have standing and a cause of action to seek judicial enforcement of the Amendment. No court of the United States or of any State may order any increase in taxes or other revenue measures to prevent or reduce fiscal year deficits.
:(5) 
::(A) The Amendment shall be phased in beginning with the first fiscal year commencing six or more months after ratification of the Amendment by the States.
::(B) Within three months after ratification, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] shall calculate the total outlays, the total receipts, and the resulting deficit of the United States for the fiscal year in which the Amendment was ratified. This deficit is the“Base Deficit”.
::(C) Fiscal year deficits shall be phased-out as follows:
:::(i) The deficit for the first fiscal year commencing six or more months after ratification by the States of the Amendment shall not exceed eighty percent of the Base Deficit.
:::(ii) The deficit for the first fiscal year commencing eighteen or more months after ratification by the States of the Amendment shall not exceed sixty percent of the Base Deficit.
:::(iii) The deficit for the first fiscal year commencing thirty or more months after ratification by the States of the Amendment shall not exceed forty percent of the Base Deficit.
:::(iv) The deficit for the first fiscal year commencing forty-two or more months after ratification by the States of the Amendment shall not exceed twenty percent of the Base Deficit.
:::(v) There shall be no deficit for any fiscal year commencing fifty-four or more months after ratification by the States of the Amendment.
