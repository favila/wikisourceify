{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued in remembrance of the victims and in honor of the veterans of the peacekeeping mission in Beirut, Lebanon, from 1982 to 1984.    Whereas on the morning of October 23, 1983, at approximately 6:20 a.m., a truck packed with explosives broke security and detonated outside of the United States Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon;   Whereas 241 United States Military personnel were killed in the blast;   Whereas a total of 273 members of the Armed Services from 36 States across the United States were killed while serving in Beirut, Lebanon, from 1982 to 1984;   Whereas the servicemen were part of a multinational peacekeeping force;   Whereas the honor and sacrifice of the victims and veterans will never be forgotten;   Whereas remembering those who lost their lives and those who served in Beirut would enhance public awareness of the roots of the war on terror and strengthen public resolve to rid the world of evil;   Whereas October 23, 2008 will mark the 25th anniversary of the Beirut bombing; and   Whereas the Nation should celebrate the peace in the American spirit that was embodied in the mission of these fallen heroes: Now, therefore, be it
