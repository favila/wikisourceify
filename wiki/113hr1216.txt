		  Veterans Affairs Veterans Center
.


{{section|H28AF19E587904979A0DDF31CC0B86FE5|1. Findings}}
[[United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
(1)
Dr. Cameron K.
			 McKinley was born on December 9, 1930, in Shreveport, Louisiana.

(2)
Dr. McKinley
			 served in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps Reserve]] in Shreveport, Louisiana, from 1947 to
			 1949.

(3)
Dr. McKinley
			 served valiantly at Wiesbaden Air Force Hospital during and after the Vietnam
			 War, providing therapy to military personnel and their families.

(4)
Dr. McKinley
			 served with great distinction as the Chief of Psychology at the Veterans
			 Affairs Hospital in Prescott, Arizona, from 1981–1995.

(5)
At the Prescott
			 Veterans Affairs Hospital, Dr. McKinley organized a Rap Group

			 for Vietnam Era veterans dealing with various degrees of post-traumatic stress
			 disorder (PTSD). That group of veterans formed the Vietnam Veterans of America,
			 Chapter 95.

(6)
Vietnam Veterans
			 of America, Chapter 95, in concert with Dr. McKinley, local leaders, businesses
			 and nonprofit groups petitioned the Federal Government for a free-standing
			 Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC).

(7)
[[United States Congress|Congress]]
			 authorized 91 new rural VAMCs, among them the Prescott Vet Center. In June of
			 1985, the Prescott Vet Center opened.

(8)
Dr. McKinley spent
			 decades confronting the pressing issue of PTSD by providing cutting-edge
			 psychological and neuropsychological assessments to the returning veterans of
			 three wars. He produced targeted action plans for veterans suffering from PTSD,
			 giving them tools to deal with their afflictions and transition successfully
			 back into civilian life.

(9)
Dr. McKinley’s
			 cutting-edge work has earned him recognition from Prescott VAMC, Vietnam
			 Veterans of America, the Veterans’ Readjustment Counseling Center, and the
			 Department of the Army for his outstanding work to improve the lives of
			 veterans of multiple generations.

(10)
It is only well
			 and fitting that as a tribute to this remarkable person’s life that [[United States Congress|Congress]]
			 seek to name the facility after the leader who was its inspiration and a
			 lifesaver for so many.
