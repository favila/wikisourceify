{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an income tax credit for the costs of certain infertility treatments, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|H2B49F287ABA449EBAA87F61A315D2043}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Family Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|HC6FF97283688496B9AFF16A635EF869C}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The American Society of Reproductive Medicine recognizes infertility as a disease, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have described infertility as an emerging public health priority in the United States. Globally, the World Health Organization also formally recognizes infertility as a disease.
:(2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 3,000,000 Americans suffer from infertility.
:(3) A portion of those 3,000,000 people are cancer survivors who were diagnosed as infants, children, or young adults. Their treatments included chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery which have led to irreparable damage to their reproductive systems.
:(4) Military families notably are also impacted by infertility as a result of lower extremity war injuries arising from the perils of modern warfare. For active duty individuals, frequent changes in permanent duty station, combat deployments, and training rotations complicate access to fertility treatments. In addition, active duty individuals or veterans have no coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF) through their military health insurance and must pay out of pocket for those expenses, even within military treatment facilities.
:(5) For many, the cost of treatment for the disease of infertility is prohibitive. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the cost per cycle of IVF is approximately $12,500, and on average couples require at least 2 cycles. Many couples have to choose between their desire to establish a family and their future financial well-being.
:(6) Medical insurance coverage for infertility treatments is sparse and inconsistent at the State level. Only 8 States have passed laws to require comprehensive infertility coverage, and under those State laws employer-sponsored plans are exempt; therefore, coverage for treatments such as IVF is limited. According to Mercer's 2005 National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, IVF was voluntarily covered by 19 percent of large employer-sponsored health plans and only 11 percent of small employer-sponsored health plans. Even in States with coverage mandates, out-of-pocket expenses for these treatments are significant.
:(7) According to the latest National Survey of Family Growth, African-American and Hispanic women are more likely to be infertile than Caucasian women, yet studies indicate that they are less likely to use infertility services.
