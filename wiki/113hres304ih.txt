 Expressing support for dancing as a form of valuable exercise and artistic expression, and for the designation of July 27, 2013, as National Dance Day.    Whereas the last Saturday in July is an appropriate day to annually celebrate National Dance Day;   Whereas Nigel Lythgoe, executive producer and celebrity judge for the dance-themed television show“So You Think You Can Dance”, in association with the Dizzy Feet Foundation, has encouraged the creation of National Dance Day in nations around the world, beginning with the first National Dance Day in 2010;   Whereas the Dizzy Feet Foundation and the Kennedy Center, in conjunction with the office of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will celebrate National Dance Day on Saturday, July 27, 2013, in the Nation’s Capital at the Kennedy Center;   Whereas National Dance Day has captured the imagination of people throughout the Nation and around the world and has helped popularize dancing as an art, for fun, and as a form of exercise;   Whereas National Dance Day encourages many forms of dance expression, representing the Nation’s rich artistic, regional, ethnic, and racial diversity;   Whereas National Dance Day features the spectrum of dance, from classical to popular to line and partner dances;   Whereas dancing helps improve heart health, burn calories, strengthen muscles, and improve flexibility for people of all ages;   Whereas health officials have repeatedly documented an overweight and obesity epidemic among every age group in the United States;   Whereas dancing, in all its variations, is a popular form of physical exercise;   Whereas National Dance Day in the Nation’s Capital will begin at 1 p.m. with performances by Dizzy Feet, Esperonto Bean and Stefani Thomas, CityDance, Doonya Dance, Flamenco Aparicio Dance Company, Joy of Motion Dance Center's Youth Dance Ensemble, Just Tap, Nomad Dancers, Dr. Janaki Rangarajan, Smooth & EZ, Washington Ballet, TheArc, and Doug Yeuell;   Whereas National Dance day will also have performances by Culture Shock and the Manzari Brothers on the Millennium Stage honoring James A. Johnson, Kennedy Center Chairman Emeritus and Millennium Stage founder; and   Whereas National Dance Day in the Nation’s Capital will culminate at 8 p.m. with“Dancing Under the Stars”dance lessons offered by Tito Rodriguez, Jr. and performances by Arturo O'Farrill and the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra: Now, therefore, be it
