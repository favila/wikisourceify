{{Center|A BILL}}

 To prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) On May 10, 2013, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]]admitted that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, seeking tax-exempt status.
:(2) This action raises pertinent questions about the agency’s ability to implement and oversee the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ([[Public Law -|Public Law 111–148]])and the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ([[Public Law -|Public Law 111–152]]).
:(3) This action could be an indication of future [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]]abuses in relation to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 , given that it is their responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual mandate.
:(4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the Federal Government. 

=Sec. 3. Prohibiting enforcement of PPACA and HCERA=

The [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], or any delegate of [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|the Secretary]], shall not implement or enforce any provisions of or amendments made by the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ([[Public Law 111-148|Public Law 111–148]] )or the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010  [[Public Law 111-152|(Public Law 111–152)]]  .
