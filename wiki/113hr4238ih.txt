::(i) not later than 60 days before the employer’s date of need for an H–2B nonimmigrant, submits the written disclosure of employment terms and conditions for such worker to the local office of the State workforce agency where the job is located, or in the case of an itinerant employer, where the job is to begin, and authorizes the posting of the written disclosure on the appropriate Department of Labor Electronic Job Registry for a period of 45 days, except that nothing in this clause shall require the employer to file an interstate job order under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/653 section 653,]of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations; and

The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]]shall establish a procedure to process petitions filed under this subsection, and shall review each petition submitted by an employer under this subsection for completeness or obvious inaccuracies.

The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]]may not reduce the number of positions that the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]]accepts for an employer pursuant to a petition under this subsection because the employer hires a United States worker before date on which the employer indicated it needed workers on the petition the employer submitted under this subsection.

Not later than the date on which an H–2B nonimmigrant completes 50 percent of the work period set forth in the petition, an employer who hires an H–2B nonimmigrant shall reimburse the H–2B nonimmigrant for the cost of transportation of the most economic and reasonable common carrier, including documented and reasonable subsistence costs during the period of travel, for that H–2B nonimmigrant, from the United States consulate issuing the visa to the H–2B nonimmigrant or previous worksite in the United States, if any, to the place of such nonimmigrant’s employment, unless the H–2B nonimmigrant has been so reimbursed by another employer.

====(2) Transportation from the place of employment– ====

If an H–2B nonimmigrant completes the work period set forth in the petition, and is not traveling to another worksite in the United States, not later than the time the H–2B nonimmigrant departs from the worksite, the employer who hired an H–2B nonimmigrant for that work period shall pay for the cost of transportation of the most economic and reasonable common carrier, including an allowance for reasonable subsistence costs during the period of travel, for that H–2B nonimmigrant, from the place of employment to the United States consulate that issued the visa to the H–2B nonimmigrant.

====(2) Labor dispute– ====

An employer may not employ an H–2B nonimmigrant for a specific job for which the employer is requesting an H–2B nonimmigrant because the former occupant of the job is on strike or being locked out in the course of a labor dispute.

The wages to be paid to H–2B nonimmigrants shall be the greater of—
:(1) the actual wage level paid by the employer to other employees with similar experience and qualifications for such position in the same location; or

===(e) Housing– ===

An employer is not required to provide housing or a housing allowance to an H–2B nonimmigrant employee.
