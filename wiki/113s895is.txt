::(B) includes a needs assessment, considering broad sources of data and models on antimicrobial use in food-producing animals that the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] may need or from which the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] could benefit, to improve the evaluation of [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] programs regarding antimicrobial resistance and how a systematic and valid data collection strategy will be designed to comply with subsection (b)(1)(B); and
:(2) make such report publicly available.

==(b) Report regarding results and recommendations– ==

Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall—

::(B) provides recommendations for developing an antimicrobial data collection strategy based on the information contained in the comments to the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled “Antimicrobial Animal Drug Distribution Reporting” (77 Fed. Reg. 44177 (July 27, 2012)) and any relevant information obtained in the research pilot program carried out under section 2; and
:(2) make such report publicly available.
