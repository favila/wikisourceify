{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 96th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan.    Whereas, on May 28, 1918, the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was proclaimed the world’s first secular Muslim parliamentary democratic republic;   Whereas the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was granted diplomatic recognition by the United States and other democratic nations;   Whereas Azerbaijan granted universal suffrage in 1918, making it the first majority Muslim country to give women the right to vote;   Whereas after the collapse of the Soviet Union the United States established full diplomatic ties with the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1992;   Whereas successive U.S. administrations have expressed support for Azerbaijani development of energy resources in the Caspian Sea region, including construction of the landmark Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline that are main arteries for delivering Caspian energy resources to global markets;   Whereas completion of the Southern Gas Corridor will increase European energy security by increasing the amount of natural gas flowing from the Caspian Sea to American allies in Europe;   Whereas in a recent letter to Azerbaijan’s President, Secretary of State John Kerry wrote,“Azerbaijan is becoming a new reliable member of world energy resources and helps ensure Europe’s energy security. The implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor after a long hard work, besides benefitting the consortium’s numerous partners and neighbors, will strengthen the independence of Azerbaijan”;   Whereas the Republic of Azerbaijan is an important strategic partner of the United States, and Azerbaijani troops serve shoulder to shoulder with U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, as they previously did in Iraq and Kosovo;   Whereas Azerbaijan and the U.S. cooperate in countering terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and narcotics trafficking;   Whereas Azerbaijan maintains close, friendly ties with Israel—America’s vital ally in the Middle East—and provides 40 percent of Israel’s oil consumption;   Whereas Azerbaijan is home to Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities and has been praised for its religious tolerance by the European Parliament;   Whereas Azerbaijan’s Jewish community has resided in Azerbaijan for 2,500 years without persecution; and   Whereas Azerbaijan supports peace and stability in the Caspian Sea region: Now, therefore, be it
