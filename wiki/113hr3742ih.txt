To provide for approval of certain drugs and biological products indicated for use in a limited population of patients in order to address increases in bacterial and fungal resistance to drugs and biological products, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Approval of certain drugs for use in a limited population of patients=
