=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:

:(2) Reports from the [[w:Bureau of Indian Affairs|Bureau of Indian Affairs]]and tribal, public, charter, and private schools and colleges that use primarily Native American languages to deliver education, have indicated that students from these schools have generally had high school graduation and college attendance rates above the norm for their peers.
:(3) The  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq].)includes policy barriers to schools taught through Native American languages and a lack of adequate funding to support such opportunities.
:(4) There is a critical need that requires immediate action to support education through Native American languages to preserve these languages.
