{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require shareholder authorization before a public company may make certain political expenditures, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Shareholder Protection Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Corporations make significant political contributions and expenditures that directly or indirectly influence the election of candidates and support or oppose political causes. Decisions to use corporate funds for political contributions and expenditures are usually made by corporate boards and executives, rather than shareholders.
:(2) Corporations, acting through their boards and executives, are obligated to conduct business for the best interests of their owners, the shareholders.
:(3) Historically, shareholders have not had a way to know, or to influence, the political activities of corporations they own. Shareholders and the public have a right to know how corporations are spending their funds to make political contributions and expenditures benefitting candidates, political parties, and political causes.
:(4) Corporations should be accountable to their shareholders in making political contributions or expenditures affecting Federal governance and public policy. Requiring the express approval of a corporation’s shareholders prior to making political contributions or expenditures will establish necessary accountability. 

=Sec. 3. Shareholder approval of corporate political activity=

The  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78a 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.])is amended by inserting after  section 14B ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78n-2 15 U.S.C. 78n–2])the following:
