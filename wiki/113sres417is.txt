{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating October 30, 2014, as a national day of remembrance for nuclear weapons program workers.    Whereas, since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women, including uranium miners, millers, and haulers, have served the United States by building nuclear weapons for the defense of the United States;   Whereas those dedicated workers paid a high price for their service to develop a nuclear weapons program for the benefit of the United States, including by developing disabling or fatal illnesses;   Whereas the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]recognized the contribution, service, and sacrifice those patriotic men and women made for the defense of the United States inSenate Resolution 151, 111th Congress, agreed to May 20, 2009,Senate Resolution 653, 111th Congress, agreed to September 28, 2010,Senate Resolution 275, 112th Congress, agreed to September 26, 2011,Senate Resolution 519, 112th Congress, agreed to August 1, 2012, andSenate Resolution 164, 113th Congress, agreed to September 18, 2013;   Whereas a national day of remembrance time capsule has been crossing the United States, collecting artifacts and the stories of nuclear weapons program workers relating to the nuclear defense era of the United States, and a remembrance quilt has been constructed to memorialize the contribution of those workers;   Whereas the stories and artifacts reflected in the time capsule and the remembrance quilt reinforce the importance of recognizing nuclear weapons program workers; and   Whereas those patriotic men and women deserve to be recognized for the contribution, service, and sacrifice they have made for the defense of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
