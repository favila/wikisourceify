For fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal years, the revenue amounts established in subsection (b)shall be adjusted by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year, by an amount equal to the sum of—

:(C) the average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers (Washington-Baltimore, DC-MD-VA-WV; not seasonally adjusted; all items less food and energy; annual index) for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 years for which data are available multiplied by the average proportion of all costs other than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] costs for the first 3 years of the preceding 4 fiscal years for which data are available.The adjustment made each fiscal year under this paragraph shall be added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2014 under this paragraph.

===(3) Workload adjustment– ===

For fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal years, after the revenue amounts established in subsection (b)are adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (2), the revenue amounts shall be further adjusted for such fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] for the process for the review of animal drug applications.

For fiscal year 2018, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may, in addition to other adjustments under this subsection, further increase the fees under this section, if such an adjustment is necessary to provide for up to 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of animal drug applications for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2019. If the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] has carryover balances for the process for the review of animal drug applications in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, then this adjustment will not be made.
