(a)
Findings
[[United States Congress|Congress]]
			 finds that—
(1)
certain
			 firefighters employed by the Federal Government are required by law to work a
			 regular tour of duty consisting of 72 hours per week;

(2)
19 of those 72
			 hours per week are considered to be overtime hours for purposes of computing
			 pay;

(3)
the pay computed
			 for those 19 overtime hours each week are not accurately accounted for when
			 computing such firefighters’ retirement benefits; and

(4)
those inaccurate
			 computations have led to reduced retirement benefits for Federal
			 firefighters.


(b)
Purpose
The
			 purpose of this Act is to correct the manner in which retirement benefits for
			 Federal firefighters are computed so as to account for pay earned for regularly
			 scheduled overtime hours during a normal tour of duty.
