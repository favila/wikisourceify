To provide for the more accurate computation of retirement benefits for certain firefighters employed by the Federal Government.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Federal Firefighter Pay Equity Act”.

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) certain firefighters employed by the Federal Government are required by law to work a regular tour of duty consisting of 72 hours per week;
:(2) 19 of those 72 hours per week are considered to be overtime hours for purposes of computing pay;
:(3) the pay computed for those 19 overtime hours each week are not accurately accounted for when computing such firefighters’ retirement benefits; and
:(4) those inaccurate computations have led to reduced retirement benefits for Federal firefighters.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to correct the manner in which retirement benefits for Federal firefighters are computed so as to account for pay earned for regularly scheduled overtime hours during a normal tour of duty.

=Sec. 3. Computation of annuity based on certain firefighter service=
