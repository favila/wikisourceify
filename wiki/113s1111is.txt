:(2) Cyber espionage of intellectual property by foreign actors is one of the most pressing issues facing innovators and entrepreneurs in the United States today.
:(3) The National Counterintelligence Executive stated in its October 2011 biennial economic espionage report that “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage” and that “United States private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China” .
:(4) The National Counterintelligence Executive also stated that “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from U.S. targets” .
:(5) The People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and other countries threaten the privacy of United States citizens by accessing and exploiting personally identifiable information through cyber economic espionage.
:(6) The People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and other countries responsible for such cyber economic espionage are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and have agreed to comply with the global system of rules and obligations governing the international commerce and trade among member states.
:(7) The United States has recognized the membership of the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and other countries into the WTO by granting them Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status under United States law.

:(2) the United States should intensify diplomatic efforts in appropriate international fora such as the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] , the [[w:|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), and summits such as the G–8 and G–20 summits, to address the harm to the international economic order by cyber economic espionage; and
