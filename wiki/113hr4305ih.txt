{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend title 10, United States Code, to provide an individual with a mental health assessment before the individual enlists in the Armed Forces or is commissioned as an officer in the Armed Forces.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Medical Evaluation Parity for Servicemembers Act of 2014   ”or the“MEPS Act”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) More focus needs to be put on mental health in America.
:(2) The large number of suicides among veterans and members of the Armed Forces is unacceptable, especially given that more members have died by suicide than in combat.
:(3) Many of those suicides in the military were members of the Armed Forces who never deployed.
:(4) Members of the Armed Forces, having been at war for more than a decade, have been put through acute physical and mental stress.
:(5) Many of the suicides in the Armed Forces can be prevented, and studies have found that improved screening reduced later behavioral problems by 78 percent and reduced thoughts of suicide by more than half.
:(6) Although the military currently has a baseline measurement process for physical health, the military does not currently have similar standards for mental health.
:(7) It is important that the military ensures that the members of the Armed Forces are both physically and mentally fit for all the missions the United States requires.
