=={{anchor|H791D4E7D34884313B5FAA8C1978E169A}}(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—

It is the purpose of this Act to prevent the Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance trust funds from being used for any purpose other than providing retirement and health security.
