{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commemorating the 150th anniversary of Mayo Clinic.    Whereas Dr. William Worrall Mayo first announced his plans to establish a medical practice in Rochester, Minnesota, on January 27, 1864;   Whereas 2014 marks 150 years of Mayo Clinic providing continuous, quality service to patients;   Whereas the Mayo Clinic model of integrated, high-quality health care has become an international model for providing health care;   Whereas the many historic achievements of Mayo Clinic includeâ€” 
:(1) developing the first integrated, multi-specialty practice of medicine; 
:(2) creating the first anti-blackout suits for military pilots during World War II; 
:(3) winning the Nobel Prize in 1950 for discovering cortisone; 
:(4) developing a DNA test that detects anthrax in less than 1 hour; and 
:(5) continuing a tradition of helping individuals in the most need of help, including by deploying medical teams to earthquake-stricken Haiti;   Whereas Mayo Clinic continues to value compassion, integrity, quality, and innovation in its leadership around the world; and   Whereas Mayo Clinic is considered a premiere global center of health and healing dedicated to medical care, research, and education: Now, therefore, be it
