{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that until the United States southern border is secured as confirmed by the governors and the legislatures jointly of the four southern border states, the House of Representatives shall not bring any legislation including any conference report regarding immigration to the floor of the House for a vote.Whereas the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act(IRCA) expresses the sense of Congress that the immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly;Whereas through increased government spending for a bigger staff and new surveillance technology IRCApromised to control the borders and “prevent and deter the illegal entry of aliens in the United States and the violation of the terms of their entry” ;Whereas IRCAdid not include any trigger to secure the border before legalization;Whereas the employment verification system established under IRCAfailed to prevent the hiring of undocumented immigrants;Whereas the [[w:Immigration and Naturalization Service|Immigration and Naturalization Service]] and then the DHS failed to properly enforce the employer sanctions laws under IRCA;Whereas ten years after the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Actwas passed the estimated number of undocumented aliens almost doubled, from 3.2 million to 5.8 million. Ten years after that, the number almost doubled again, to 11.6 million;Whereas the [[w:Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office]] projects that the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Actwill result in 4.8 million new illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born children will be living in the United States by 2023;Whereas according to a 2010 Rasmussen poll 68 percent of likely voters think that securing the border is more important than granting amnesty to illegal aliens;Whereas
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]] previously promised to secure the U.S. border with Mexico;Whereas
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]] and the Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano have enacted policies outside of their Constitutional authority that deliberately undermine immigration enforcement laws by instructing various law enforcement agencies, including [[w:U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] and [[w:U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs and Border Patrol]] not to carry out their statutory duties;Whereas a recent [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] report found that only 129 miles of the approximate 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico are under “full control” ; andWhereas the non-partisan [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] also determined that less than half of the southwest border is under “operational control” : Now, therefore, be it
