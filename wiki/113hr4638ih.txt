{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a largely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed vascular genetic bleeding disorder resulting in artery-vein malformations (AVMs) which lead to preventable catastrophic and disabling consequences. HHT can cause sudden death at any age, unless detected and treated. Early detection, screening, and use of readily available treatment can prevent premature deaths and long-term health complications resulting from HHT. A person with HHT has the tendency to form blood vessels that lack the capillaries between an artery and vein. HHT often results in spontaneous hemorrhage or stroke from brain or lung AVM. In addition to hemorrhagic stroke, embolic stroke and brain abscess occur in approximately 30 percent of persons with HHT artery-vein malformations in the lung (due to lack of capillaries between the arterial and venous systems which normally filter out clots and bacteria).
:(2) One in 5,000 American children and adults suffer from HHT.
:(3) Studies have found an increase in morbidity and mortality rates for individuals who suffer from HHT.
:(4) Due to the widespread lack of knowledge, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate intervention, 90 percent of HHT-affected families are at risk for preventable life-threatening and disabling medical incidents such as stroke.
:(5) Early detection, screening, and treatment can prevent premature deaths, spontaneous hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, embolic stroke, brain abscess, and other long-term health care complications resulting from HHT.
:(6) HHT is an important health condition with serious health consequences which are amenable to early identification and diagnosis with suitable tests, and acceptable and available treatments in established treatment centers.
:(7) Timely identification and management of HHT cases is an important public health objective because it will save lives, prevent disability, and reduce direct and indirect health care costs expenditures. A recent study has found use of a genetic testing model for HHT diagnosis saves $9.9 million in that screening can be limited to those persons within the family groups who actually have the gene defect, leading to early intervention in those found to have treatable AVMs.
:(8) Without a new program for early detection, screening, and treatment, 14,000 children and adults who suffer from HHT in the population today will suffer premature death and disability. 

=Sec. 3. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to create a federally led and financed initiative for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia that will result in the reduction of the suffering of families, prevent premature death and disability, and lower health care costs through proven treatment interventions. 

=Sec. 4. Centers for disease control and prevention=

  Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after  section 317T ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/247b–22 42 U.S.C. 247b–22])the following:
