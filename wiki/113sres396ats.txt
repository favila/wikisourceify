{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating March 25, 2014, as“National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day”.    Whereas the term ‘‘cerebral palsy’’ refers to a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occur in the developing brain;   Whereas cerebral palsy, the most common motor disability in children, is caused by damage to 1 or more specific areas of the developing brain, which usually occurs during fetal development, before, during, or after birth;   Whereas the majority of children who have cerebral palsy are born with the disorder, although cerebral palsy may remain undetected for months or years;   Whereas individuals with cerebral palsy also have at least 1 co-occurring condition, with 41 percent of such individuals having co-occurring epilepsy and nearly 7 percent having co-occurring autism spectrum disorder;   Whereas the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]has released information indicating that cerebral palsy is not decreasing in prevalence and that an estimated 1 in 323 children has cerebral palsy;   Whereas approximately 800,000 people in the United States are affected by cerebral palsy;   Whereas although there is currently no cure for cerebral palsy, treatment often improves the capabilities of a child with cerebral palsy;   Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that breakthroughs in cerebral palsy research will be forthcoming;   Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting important research projects involving cerebral palsy; and   Whereas the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]is an institution that can raise awareness in the general public and the medical community about cerebral palsy: Now, therefore, be it
