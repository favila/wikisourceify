{{section|HD1CFB365D6404F65A7799BD0D333FCCC|1. Findings}}

        [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
(1)
More than 500 Baha'is in Iran have been
			 arbitrarily arrested since 2005. Roughly 100 Baha'is are presently imprisoned
			 because of their religious beliefs.

(2)
In May 2010,
			 suspected terrorists attacked two mosques in Pakistan belonging to the
			 Ah­mad­diya minority Muslim sect, killing at least 80 people. Ahmadis consider
			 themselves Muslim, but Pakistani law does not recognize them as such.

(3)
Said Musa, an
			 Afghan Christian convert, was arrested in May 2010 on charges of apostasy, a
			 crime which can carry the death sentence, and was released in February 2011
			 only after sustained international pressure.

(4)
On October 31,
			 2010, gunmen laid siege on Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad, Iraq,
			 killing at least 52 police and worshipers, including two priests, making it the
			 worst massacre of Iraqi Christians since 2003.

(5)
Iraq’s ancient and
			 once vibrant Christian population that numbered an estimated 1,500,000 out of a
			 total population in Iraq of 30,000,000 in 2003 has been reduced by at least one
			 half, due in significant part to Christians fleeing the violence.

(6)
In November 2010,
			 a Pakistani court sentenced Aasia Bibi, a Christian mother of five, to death
			 under the country’s blasphemy law for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.

(7)
Since early 2011, violent sectarian attacks
			 targeting Coptic Orthodox Christians and their property increased
			 significantly, resulting in nearly 100 deaths, mostly Coptic Christians,
			 surpassing the death toll of the 10 previous years combined.

(8)
In Egypt, with the
			 ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood, Coptic Christians, numbering roughly 8 to 10
			 million, are leaving in droves.

(9)
On March 2, 2011, Pakistani Federal
			 Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of the Cabinet,
			 who was outspoken in his opposition to Pakistan’s blasphemy laws was
			 assassinated by extremists.

(10)
The Special Envoy
			 for Anti-Semitism, Hannah Rosenthal, has noted that Holocaust glorification
			 is especially virulent in Middle Eastern media, some of which is
			 state-owned and operated, which calls for a new Holocaust to finish the
			 job
.

(11)
In the midst of a devastating civil war,
			 Syrian Christians and other religious minorities, which comprise roughly 10
			 percent of the population, are particularly vulnerable lacking their own
			 militias and regional protectors.

(12)
Many of these
			 ancient faith communities are being forced to flee the lands which they have
			 inhabited for centuries.

(13)
The [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|United States
			 Commission on International Religious Freedom]] has recommended that Egypt,
			 Tajikistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan be
			 designated by the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] as Countries of Particular Concern in
			 accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998
.

(14)
The situation on
			 the ground in the region continues to develop rapidly and the United States
			 Government needs an individual who can respond in kind and focus on the
			 critical situation of religious minorities in these countries.

(15)
There are historical precedents, including
			 the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, the Special Envoy for
			 North Korea Human Rights Issues, and the South Sudan and Sudan Special Envoy,
			 for the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], either as a result of legislative mandate or
			 initiative of the [[United States Department of State|Secretary of State]], to create positions with a targeted focus
			 on an area or issue of recognized import.
