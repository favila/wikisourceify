={{anchor|H3FE7C099DCB8443AB205A1A2A054F749}}Section 1. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The safety and security of the civil air transportation system is critical to the United States security and its national defense.
:(2) A safe and secure United States civil air transportation system is essential to the basic freedom of Americans to move in intrastate, interstate, and international transportation.
:(3) Terrorists have previously used airline aircraft as weapons and exploited United States aviation security.
:(4) Reinforced cockpit doors that must be opened for physiological and operational needs present a clear vulnerability when the doors are open and this compromises the security and safety of the aircraft and its passengers.
:(5) Many all-cargo aircraft do not have a cockpit door installed for protection from passenger aggressors and stowaways.

::(A) for an aircraft that is equipped with a cockpit door, requiring that such secondary barriers remain locked while the aircraft is in flight and the cockpit door separating the flight deck and the passenger area is open; and
::(B) for an aircraft that is not equipped with a cockpit door, requiring that such secondary barriers remain locked as determined by the pilot in command.
