=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) On September 11 and 12, 2012, terrorists attacked the United States Special Mission compound and Annex in Benghazi, Libya.
:(2) The attacks resulted in the deaths of Ambassador John Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty, in addition to severely wounding other United States personnel and Libyan guards.
:(3) The United States personnel in Benghazi performed bravely in protecting their colleagues despite the scale and intensity of the attacks.
:(4) An Accountability Review Board chaired ably by Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and vice-chaired by Admiral Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was subsequently convened to examine security failures leading to the attacks.
:(5) The Board found, in particular, the following:
::(A) Systemic failures in leadership and management at the Department of State led to inadequate security and unclear lines of responsibility for security considerations in Benghazi.
::(B) Physical security at the site was inadequate and local Libyan responders failed to adequately respond to the sudden penetration of the mission.
::(C) There were no immediate, specific tactical warnings of an attack although officials were aware of intelligence gaps on militia activity in Libya and the threat such activity posed to United States interests.
:(6) The Board made 29 recommendations for the Department of State, including—
::(A) enhancing security in high risk, high threat posts and reviewing the balance between the risk and benefits of a particular post;
::(B) reexamining organization and management with a focus on security planning in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security;
::(C) establishing minimum security standards for temporary facilities, such as Benghazi, in high risk, high threat environments; and
::(D) improving training for personnel serving in high risk, high threat posts.
:(7) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accepted all of the Board’s recommendations and directed that they be implemented.
:(8) United States public servants work in dangerous places around the world to advance United States interests and values, and it is not possible to conduct robust diplomatic and development efforts without inherent risk.
:(9) The dedicated men and women of the foreign and civil service are worthy of a serious and sustained commitment to enhancing security and better protecting them when they serve in hostile environments.
