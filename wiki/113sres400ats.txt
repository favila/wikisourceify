{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the 50thanniversary of the Great Alaska Earthquake, which struck the State of Alaska at 5:36 p.m. on Good Friday, March 27, 1964, honoring those who lost their lives in the Great Alaska Earthquake and associated tsunamis, and expressing continued support for research on earthquake and tsunami prediction and mitigation strategies.    Whereas on Good Friday, March 27, 1964, the Great Alaska Earthquake struck the State of Alaska;   Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake measured 9.2 on the moment magnitude scale, making it the largest recorded earthquake in United States history and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded using modern instruments;   Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake was felt as far away as Seattle and was registered by water-level recorders in 47 States;   Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake spawned tsunamis that devastated communities in Alaska and impacted the States of Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii, as well as Canada and Japan;   Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake and associated tsunamis resulted in 131 fatalities, including 4 fatalities in Oregon and 12 fatalities in California, and an estimated $3,750,000,000 in property losses in today’s dollars;   Whereas the wealth of data collected during the Great Alaska Earthquake led to major breakthroughs in the scientific understanding of subduction zone earthquakes and earthquake hazards, resulting in improved earthquake mitigation strategies;   Whereas the study of the tsunamis associated with the Great Alaska Earthquake resulted in improved tsunami prediction and warning capabilities; and   Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake spurred the [[w:United States Geological Survey|United States Geological Survey]], in cooperation with earthquake-impacted States, to install extensive earthquake monitoring networks across the United States and establish the National Center for Earthquake Research: Now, therefore, be it

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]—
:(1) mourns the lives lost due to the Great Alaska Earthquake and associated tsunamis that occurred on Good Friday, March 27, 1964;
:(2) recognizes the improved understanding of earthquakes and tsunamis and the scientific and technological advancements that resulted from the study of data collected during the Great Alaska Earthquake;
:(3) commends the efforts of scientists and engineers from the [[w:United States Geological Survey|United States Geological Survey]], as well as those in Alaska, California, and other earthquake-impacted States, to improve earthquake and tsunami prediction and hazard mitigation strategies and protect the well-being of United States citizens threatened by these hazards;
:(4) supports continued research, education, and outreach about earthquakes and other natural hazards; and
:(5) encourages participation in the Great Alaska ShakeOut earthquake drill scheduled to occur on March 27, 2014.
