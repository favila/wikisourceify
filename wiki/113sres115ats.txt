 Commending the heroism, courage, and sacrifice of Sean Collier, an officer in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department, Martin Richard, an 8-year-old resident of Dorchester, Massachusetts, Krystle Campbell, a native of Medford, Massachusetts, Lu Lingzi, a student at Boston University, and all the victims who are recovering from injuries caused by the attacks in Boston, Massachusetts, including Richard Donohue, Jr., an officer in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Transit Police Department.    Whereas, in the aftermath of the deadly bombings that occurred on Patriots’ Day, April 15, 2013, during the running of the 117th Boston Marathon, the residents of Massachusetts and the people of the United States witnessed the incredible bravery, dedication, and sacrifice of law enforcement officers, first responders, and citizen heroes;   Whereas Sean Collier of Wilmington, Massachusetts, an officer in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (referred to in this preamble as“MIT”) Police Department, gave his life in the line of duty, the ultimate sacrifice;   Whereas Officer Sean Collier was protecting the students of MIT when he was killed as he sat in his police cruiser;   Whereas Officer Sean Collier was known by his family, friends, and co-workers as a generous, kind, friendly, and devoted individual and officer;   Whereas the people of the United States join with the family of Officer Sean Collier, the MIT community, and the residents of Massachusetts in mourning the loss of Officer Sean Collier, a dedicated, hardworking, and respected young police officer;   Whereas the people of the United States remember Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy from Dorchester, Massachusetts;   Whereas Martin Richard loved to play sports and draw pictures, and was dearly loved by his family, friends, classmates, and community;   Whereas the people of the United States will always remember and strive to live by the poignant and powerful message from Martin Richard:“No more hurting people. Peace.”;   Whereas the people of the United States remember Krystle Campbell, who grew up in Medford, Massachusetts and attended every Boston Marathon since she was a young girl;   Whereas Krystle Campbell will be remembered as a selfless and caring person who was always there for others;   Whereas the people of the United States are inspired by Krystle Campbell and her kind act of caring for her grandmother, who was recovering from an operation;   Whereas the people of the United States remember Lu Lingzi, who came to the United States from China to study statistics at Boston University;   Whereas, on the morning of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, Lu Lingzi posted on a social media site that she was enjoying her day;   Whereas Lu Lingzi is a reminder of our common humanity, and that senseless acts of terrorism, such as the bombings that occurred during the running of the Boston Marathon, are crimes that have no borders;   Whereas Richard Donohue, Jr., an officer in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Transit Police Department, worked a shift at the Boston Marathon on Monday, April 15, 2013, and was wounded early in the morning on Friday, April 19, 2013, when he raced to assist officers from the MIT and City of Cambridge Police Departments as they pursued the Boston Marathon bombing suspects in Watertown, Massachusetts;   Whereas, during the ensuing shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., and other officers, acting with complete disregard for their own safety, withstood a barrage of gunfire and explosives unleashed by the suspects;   Whereas, during the shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., was seriously wounded by a bullet that nearly took his life;   Whereas Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., is recovering from his injuries and remains in critical but stable condition; and   Whereas the people of the United States pray for all the people who were wounded during the attacks, and pledge to assist them in any way possible to help them recover from their injuries: Now, therefore, be it
