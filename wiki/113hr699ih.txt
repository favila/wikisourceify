:(b) It is the sense of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House]] that the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] should replace the entire 10-year sequester established by the Budget Control Act of 2011with a balanced approach that would increase revenues without increasing the tax burden on middle-income Americans, and decrease long-term spending while maintaining the Medicare guarantee, protecting Social Security and a strong social safety net, and making strategic investments in education, science, research, and critical infrastructure necessary to compete in the global economy.
