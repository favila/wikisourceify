{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives commending efforts by the United States to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a negotiated two-state solution.    Whereas the special relationship between the United States and Israel is rooted in shared national security interests and shared values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law;   Whereas the United States has worked for decades to strengthen Israel's security through assistance and cooperation on defense and intelligence matters in order to enhance the safety of United States citizens and Israelis;   Whereas the United States remains unwavering in its commitment to help Israel address the myriad challenges our ally faces, including threats from anti-Israel terrorist organizations, regional instability, horrifying violence in neighboring states, and preventing a nuclear-armed Iran;   Whereas, the United States continues to seek a permanent, two-state solution to resolve the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians;   Whereas for 20 years, Presidents of the United States from both political parties and Israeli Prime Ministers have supported attaining a peace agreement that establishes a Palestinian state, coexisting side-by-side with Israel in peace and security;   Whereas ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is vital to the interests of both parties;   Whereas delays to a political solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians pose a threat to the ability to maintain a Jewish and democratic state of Israel;   Whereas Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said on April 17, 2013,“We are committed to our aspiration for peace, a peace that will be based on the principle of two states for two peoples, a Jewish state alongside a demilitarized Palestinian state.”;   Whereas on April 29, 2013, speaking on behalf of an Arab League delegation, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani announced support for efforts to reach a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, calling it“a strategic choice for the Arab state”;   Whereas Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas reportedly said on August 22, 2013,“Signing the agreement will signal the end of the conflict.”;   Whereas on May 28, 2013, United States Secretary of State
[[w:John_Kerry|John F. Kerry]]announced a multilateral plan to revitalize the Palestinian economy, thereby demonstrating goodwill to the Palestinian people as they commit to peace negotiations; and   Whereas on July 29, 2013, the Israelis and Palestinians engaged in face-to-face talks, moving toward a resumption of formal negotiations on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict's final status issues: Now, therefore, be it
