{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Designating June 2013 as National Aphasia Awareness Month and supporting efforts to increase awareness of aphasia.Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by brain damage that typically results from a stroke;Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological disorders, such as a brain tumor;Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls language and movement on the right side of the body;Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of, or reduction in, the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains intact;Whereas, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this preamble as the NINDS ), strokes are the third-leading cause of death in the United States, ranking behind heart disease and cancer;Whereas strokes are a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States;Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are approximately 5,000,000 stroke survivors in the United States;Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United States suffer approximately 750,000 strokes per year, with about1/3of the strokes resulting in aphasia;Whereas, according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least 1,000,000 people in the United States;Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people in the United States acquire aphasia each year;Whereas the people of the United States should strive to learn more about aphasia and to promote research, rehabilitation, and support services for people with aphasia and aphasia caregivers throughout the United States; andWhereas people with aphasia and their caregivers envision a world that recognizes the “silent” disability of aphasia and provides opportunity and fulfillment for people affected by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it
