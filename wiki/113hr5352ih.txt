:(3) The Federal Government devotes more than three times the amount of budgetary resources to supporting home ownership than it devotes to making affordable rental housing available.
:(4) The burden of housing costs is more pronounced among renters than among owners.
:(5) There is a shortage of more than 7 million homes affordable to families in the bottom 20 percent of income, meaning that there are only 30 affordable units for every 100 families.
:(6) Only one in four families that qualify for rental housing assistance receives benefits.
:(7) Housing assistance waiting lists can be 10 years long and in many communities are closed.
:(8) The shortage of rental homes that are affordable for extremely low-income households to be the principal cause of homelessness in the United States.
:(9) Public housing facilities in the United States have more than $26 billion in deferred maintenance after decades of neglect which results in a loss of 10,000 units each year.
:(10) The low-income housing tax credit successfully provides 100,000 units of affordable housing every year.
:(11) Every tax reform commission has recommended capping the mortgage interest deduction and converting it to a fairer and simpler credit.
:(12) More than 75 percent of the value of the mortgage interest deduction inures to the benefit of the top 20 percent of earners.
:(13) Fewer than half of tax filers with a home mortgage claim the mortgage interest deduction.
:(14) Only 9 percent of rural tax filers claim the mortgage interest deduction.
:(15) Ninety-six percent of homes sold between 2005 and 2011 sold for less than $500,000.
:(16) A better approach that provides equitable benefits for families who buy homes, enables more low- and moderate-income homeowners to receive a benefit, and invests in affordable rental housing to assist those who used to be homeless or who have extremely or very low incomes is needed to strengthen families and communities.

:(2) Children who experience hunger are more likely to get sick and are more likely to be obese than those who do not. Children facing chronic hunger also find it more difficult to concentrate in school and tend to exhibit higher levels of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems.
:(3) Federal programs play an important role in addressing childhood hunger. In 2013, 21 million students participated in the free or reduced-price lunch program. Eleven million students participated in the free or reduced-price breakfast program. Three million low-income children received free meals during the summer months. Forty-seven percent of participants in the supplemental nutrition assistance program are under the age of 18.
:(4) On average, students who eat school breakfast achieve 17.5 percent higher scores on standardized math tests, and attend 1.5 more days of school each year than those who do not. Students who attend class more regularly are 20 percent more likely to graduate from high school. Participation in the school breakfast program is associated with children having a lower Body Mass Index.

==Title XVI— Living American Wage==



==Sec. 1601. Findings; sense of Congress==



===(a) Findings– ===

Congress finds the following:
:(1) In 2012, there were over 46,500,000 Americans living in poverty who were separated from the opportunities of the Nation by their income, their housing, and their access to education, jobs, and health care.
:(2) A full-time worker earning the Federal minimum wage earns an income below the Federal poverty threshold for a family of 4, consisting of 2 adults and 2 children.
:(3) The average fair market rent for a 1-bedroom apartment is more than 65 percent of the monthly income of a full-time worker earning the minimum wage. In comparison, the generally accepted definition of affordability is for a household to pay not more than 30 percent of its income on housing.
:(4) Two full-time workers earning the Federal minimum wage earn an income below the national housing wage for a 1-bedroom apartment, the amount a person needs to earn to afford a 1-bedroom apartment at average rent.

===(b) Sense of Congress– ===

It is the sense of Congress that—
:(1) the Federal minimum wage should, as a minimum, be adjusted every 4 years so that a person working for such a wage may earn an annual income that is not less than 15 percent higher than the Federal poverty threshold for a family of 4, as determined by the [[w:Bureau of the Census|Bureau of the Census]];
:(2) the minimum wage should be set at a level high enough to allow 2 full-time minimum wage workers to earn an income above the national housing wage; and
:(3) Congress, any of the several States, the District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United States, any Indian tribe, or any local or municipal government of a State may establish a higher minimum wage requirement than that established in this title.

:::(3) The minimum wage rate determined by the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]]under paragraph (1) shall be the minimum hourly wage sufficient for a person working for such wage for 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, to earn an annual income in an amount that is 15 percent higher than the Federal poverty threshold for a family of 4, with two children under the age of 18, and living in any of the 48 contiguous States, as published by the [[w:Bureau of the Census|Bureau of the Census]]for the year in which the wage rate is being so determined. .

==Title XXII— Half in Ten Act to Create a National Strategy to Reduce Poverty==



==Sec. 2201. Findings==

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The persistence of poverty, and especially intergenerational poverty, in America can be seen as a deep, structural problem that implicates our value system and our educational and economic institutions.
:(2) Poverty may be defined as the lack of basic necessities of life such as food, shelter, clothing, health care, education, economic security, and economic opportunity.
:(3) Policy initiatives and many safety net programs addressing poverty have not kept pace with the needs of millions of Americans.
:(4) The lack of an equitable distribution of housing choices across the country leads to isolation and concentrated poverty.
:(5) The number of Americans living in poverty rose by over 2.6 million from 2009 to 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, September 2011).
:(6) There were 46.2 million Americans living in poverty in 2010, consisting of 15.1 percent of the American people (U.S. Census Bureau, September 2011).
:(7) Poverty has a disproportionate impact on minority communities in America with 27.4 percent of African-Americans, 26.6 percent of Hispanics, 12.1 percent of Asian Americans, and 9.9 percent of Whites living in poverty in the United States in 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, September 2011).
:(8) In 2010 a family of 4 was considered poor under the U.S. Census Bureau’s official measure if the family’s income was below $22,314.
:(9) The economic consequences of poverty in the United States are estimated to be at least $500 billion per year (Center for American Progress, 2007).
:(10) Children who grow up in poverty experience higher crime rates, decreased productivity, and higher health costs over their lives (Center for American Progress, 2007).
:(11) 3,500,000 seniors lived in poverty in 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011).
:(12) Young Americans, ages 18–24, experience a higher poverty rate than the national average (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011).
:(13) 16,400,000 children lived in poverty in 2010—more than one in every five American children (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011).
:(14) Almost 35 percent of African-American children and over 30 percent of Hispanic children lived in poverty in 2009 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011).
:(15) The 46,180,000 of Americans in poverty in 2010 was the largest number yet recorded in the 52 years for which poverty estimates are available (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011).
:(16) Individuals and families in poverty are more socially vulnerable to natural disasters, extreme weather and impacts of climate change and have greater difficulty preparing for, responding to and recovering from such events (Oxfam America, 2009).
:(17) Children who live in families who fall into poverty for even short periods of time are at greater risk of a lifetime of lower earnings, lower educational attainment, and increased reliance on public services and increased rates of incarceration (First Focus, 2008).
:(18) It is estimated that the additional 3 million children who were forced into poverty due to the recession of 2008, resulted in $35 billion in economic losses annually, and will cause at least $1.7 trillion in economic losses to the United States during their lifetimes (First Focus, 2008).
:(19) Reducing poverty, especially child poverty, not only reduces costs for Federal, State, and local social services and benefits programs, but also increases tax revenue at all levels of government (Children’s Defense Fund, 2009).
:(20) The [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], on January 22, 2008, has resolved that it is the sense of Congress that the United States should set a national goal of cutting poverty in half over the next 10 years.

:(1) develop, within 180 days of enactment, a National Strategy to reduce the number of persons living in poverty in America in half within 10 years of the release of the 2012 Census report on Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2011, that includes goals and objectives relating to—
::(A) reducing in half the number of Americans living in poverty as reported by the 2012 Census report on Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2011;
::(B) eliminating child poverty in America;
::(C) eliminating extreme poverty in America;
::(D) improving the effectiveness and outcomes of poverty-related programs by improving our understanding of the root causes of poverty, the social, economic, and the cultural contributors to persistent intergenerational poverty;
::(E) improving the measure of poverty to include more indicators and measures that can meaningfully account for other aspects relating to the measure of poverty, such as regional differences in costs of living, the impact of rising income inequality, the impact of the persistent“digital divide”, expanding the understanding of poverty by distinguishing a standard that measures a level of freedom from deprivation versus a standard that measures a standard of economic adequacy provided by a living wage and access to a decent living standard, and the impact of poverty on other measures of economic stability and economic outcomes, such as educational attainment, rates of incarceration, lifetime earnings, access to health care, health care outcomes, access to housing, and including other measures as necessary to improve our understanding of why poverty persists in America;
::(F) eliminating the disparate rates of poverty based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, or sexual orientation and identity, especially among children in those households so impacted;
::(G) measuring effectiveness of poverty related programs on the basis of long-term outcomes, including the long-term savings and value of preventive practice and policy, and employing fact-based measures of programs to make improvements;

::(I) making more uniform eligibility requirements to improve the coordination of service delivery, reduce gaps in eligibility, and improve outcomes of programs addressing poverty in the Federal Government;
::(J) reducing the negative impacts of asset limits for eligibility which impact Federal, State and local poverty programs on the effectiveness of programs where limited eligibility creates gaps in necessary service and benefit delivery, and restricts access to benefits as individuals and families attempt to transition off of assistance programs and which can prevent needy beneficiaries from improving long-term outcomes and achieving long-term economic independence from need-based programs;
::(K) identifying Federal programs, including those related to disaster relief, hazard mitigation, extreme weather and climate change, and necessary reforms to better target resources towards disproportionately impacted socially vulnerable, low-income and disadvantaged communities may provide greater socio-economic benefits;

::(O) developing a comprehensive strategy to connect low-income young people and to re-connect currently disconnected youth to education, work, and their community; and
::(P) shifting the focus of poverty and means-tested programs across the Federal Government beyond the relief of deprivation and instead setting goals, measures, and outcomes more focused on measuring the success of programs in supporting and improving how capable individuals and families can access educational and economic opportunities to successfully transition away from accessing public assistance and benefits and achieving long-term economic stability which will reduce long-term costs in domestic social needs programs, reduce long-term health care costs due to the improved health of formerly poverty stricken households, increase the number of taxpaying individuals which will increase revenue, and lower the enrollment and costs in need based benefits and services programs, thus improving the economy and reducing long-term deficits for Federal, State, and local governments;
:(2) oversee, coordinate, and integrate all policies and activities of the Federal Government, in coordination and consultation with the [[w:Executive Office of the President|Domestic Policy Council]]and the [[w:Executive Office of the President|National Economic Council]], across all agencies relating to reducing the number of individuals, families, and children living below the Federal poverty line, in extreme poverty or near poverty and increasing the number of households able to achieve long-term economic stability with assets sufficient to maintain a decent living standard without relying on public supports—
::(A) economic, commercial, and programmatic policies that can effect or relieve the effects of poverty through job creation, and economic development targeted to low-income, minority, rural, urban and other populations who suffer disparate rates of poverty, among Federal agencies; and
::(B) services and benefits including emergency programs, discretionary economic programs, and other policies and activities necessary to ensure that the Federal Government is able to mount effective responses to economic downturns and increases in the rates of poverty;
:(3) ensure that all relevant Federal agencies comply with appropriate guidelines, policies, and directives from the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Federal Interagency Working Group on Reducing Poverty]]and the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]and other Federal agencies with responsibilities relating to poverty reduction or improving economic stability and independence;
