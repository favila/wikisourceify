The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:: In the late 19th century and early 20th century, African-American troops who came to be known as the Buffalo Soldiers served in many critical roles in the western United States, including protecting some of the first National Parks.: Based at the Presidio in San Francisco, Buffalo Soldiers were assigned to Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks where they patrolled the backcountry, built trails, stopped poaching, and otherwise served in the roles later assumed by National Park rangers.: The public would benefit from having opportunities to learn more about the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks and their contributions to the management of National Parks and the legacy of African-Americans in the post-Civil War era.: As the centennial of the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park Service ]]in 2016 approaches, it is an especially appropriate time to conduct research and increase public awareness of the stewardship role the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the National Parks.

The study shall include—: a historical assessment, based on extensive research, of the Buffalo Soldiers who served in National Parks in the years prior to the establishment of the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Park Service ]];: an evaluation of the suitability and feasibility of establishing a national historic trail commemorating the route traveled by the Buffalo Soldiers from their post in the Presidio of San Francisco to Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks and to any other National Parks where they may have served;: the identification of properties that could meet criteria for listing in the [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Register of Historic Places ]]or criteria for designation as [[Wikipedia:National Park Service|National Historic Landmarks ]];: an evaluation of appropriate ways to enhance historical research, education, interpretation, and public awareness of the story of the Buffalo Soldiers’ stewardship role in the National Parks, including ways to link the story to the development of National Parks and the story of African-American military service following the Civil War; and: any other matters that the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior ]]deems appropriate for this study.
