			 purpose=



=={{anchor|H2328D2D1DA024471B092A20ACDEE270C}}(a) Findings– ==

[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) In approving the Compact of Free
			 Association it was not the intent of Congress to cause adverse consequences for
			 States, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United States.
:(2) [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] declared that if any adverse
			 consequences to States, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United
			 States resulted from implementation of the Compact of Free Association,
			 [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] would act sympathetically and expeditiously to redress those adverse
			 consequences.
:(3) The [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|Government
			 Accountability Office]] has reported that migration from the Freely Associated
			 States has had a significant impact on Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern
			 Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii and some areas of the continental
			 United States.
:(4) By placing demands on local governments for
			 health, educational, and other social services, migration under the Compact has
			 adversely affected the budgetary resources of several States and
			 territories.
:(5) Insufficient sums
			 have been appropriated to cover the costs incurred by Guam, the Commonwealth of
			 the Northern Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii, resulting from increased
			 demands placed on health, educational, and other social services by individuals
			 from the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands,
			 and the Republic of Palau.

=={{anchor|HC56A9AEED28947ED9C4AC182F36CD90B}}(b) Purpose– ==

It
			 is the purpose of this Act to address the unfunded mandate and adverse
			 financial consequences resulting from the Compact by meeting the obligations
			 set forth in the Compact.
