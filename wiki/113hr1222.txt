This Act may be cited as the“Compact-Impact Aid Act of 2013”.

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) In approving the Compact of Free Association it was not the intent of Congress to cause adverse consequences for States, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United States.
:(2)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] declared that if any adverse consequences to States, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United States resulted from implementation of the Compact of Free Association, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] would act sympathetically and expeditiously to redress those adverse consequences.
:(3) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] has reported that migration from the Freely Associated States has had a significant impact on Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii and some areas of the continental United States.
:(4) By placing demands on local governments for health, educational, and other social services, migration under the Compact has adversely affected the budgetary resources of several States and territories.
:(5) Insufficient sums have been appropriated to cover the costs incurred by Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii, resulting from increased demands placed on health, educational, and other social services by individuals from the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.

==(b) Purpose– ==

It is the purpose of this Act to address the unfunded mandate and adverse financial consequences resulting from the Compact by meeting the obligations set forth in the Compact.
