{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate that the President should pursue extradition authority for international cy­ber­crim­i­nals committing credit card theft targeting United States citizens.    Whereas the number of United States citizens who have had their identity and financial information compromised as a result of recent data breaches at major retailers exceeds 100,000,000;   Whereas the financial security of middle class Americans has been put at risk by these criminal attacks;   Whereas cybercrimes targeting the financial information of United States citizens are often transnational crimes; and   Whereas the United States does not currently have established extradition agreements with many countries acting as safe havens for cybercriminals: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]that the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]should immediately launch international negotiations with the governments of the world's leading powers for new, effective extradition treaties with countries with which the United States has no current extradition authority, as well as renegotiate old, ineffective treaties, in order to combat more effectively international cybercriminals, including those who target the credit card information of United States citizens.
