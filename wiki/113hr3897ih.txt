:(v) The transfer is fair and reasonable.
:(vi) Not later than 5 days, and not earlier than 15 days, before the date on which the payee first incurs any obligations with respect to the transfer, the transferee provides to the payee a disclosure statement which sets forth in a clear and conspicuous manner the following:
