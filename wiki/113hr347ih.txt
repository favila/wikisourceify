={{anchor|H7C6ECBAC6459419E8B52CF7F8DFA9770}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Students must be prepared in core academic subjects.
:(2) Students must possess the skills to be able to think critically and solve problems, be effective communicators, collaborate with others, and learn to create and innovate.
:(3) In order for students in the United States to be prepared to succeed in citizenship and workplaces of the present and future, core academic subjects must be fused with critical thinking and problem solving, communication, collaboration, and creativity and innovation skills, as such skills are critical for success in the 21st century.
:(4) The work of the National Governors Association, along with the Council of Chief State School Officers, in developing a set of voluntary and internationally benchmarked national common standards in mathematics and English that include rigorous content and 21st century skills, is a positive development and should serve as a basis for incorporating those skills and other critical skills throughout other core academic subjects in the future. Federal policy must support State leadership and encourage continued State innovation.
