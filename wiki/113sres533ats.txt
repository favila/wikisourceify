{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating September 2014 as“National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month”.    Whereas over 1,275,000 individuals in the United States are estimated to live with a spinal cord injury and cost society billions of dollars in health care and lost wages;   Whereas 100,000 of the individuals in the United States with a spinal cord injury are estimated to be veterans who suffered the spinal cord injury while serving as members of the Armed Forces;   Whereas accidents are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries;   Whereas motor vehicle crashes are the second leading cause of spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries;   Whereas 70 percent of all spinal cord injuries that occur in children under the age of 18 are a result of motor vehicle accidents;   Whereas every 48 minutes a person becomes paralyzed, underscoring the urgent need to develop new neuroprotection, pharmacological, and regeneration treatments to reduce, prevent, and reverse paralysis; and   Whereas increased education and investment in research are key factors to improving outcomes for victims of spinal cord injuries, improving the quality of life of victims, and ultimately curing paralysis: Now, therefore, be it
