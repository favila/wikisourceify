{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Transportation Security Administration should, in accordance with existing law, enhance security against terrorist attack and other security threats to our Nation’s rail and mass transit systems and other modes of surface transportation; and for other purposes.    Whereas the [[w:Transportation Security Administration|Transportation Security Administration]] is uniquely positioned to lead the efforts to secure our Nation’s rail and mass transit systems and other modes of surface transportation against terrorist attack as a result of expertise developed over nine years of securing our Nation's commercial air transportation system;   Whereas the successes of the [[w:Transportation Security Administration|Transportation Security Administration's National Explosives Detection Canine Team Program]] has furthered the Transportation Security Administration's ability to secure our Nation’s transportation systems against terrorist attack by preventing and protecting against explosives threats;   Whereas each weekday 11,300,000 passengers depend on our Nation’s mass transit systems as a means of transportation;   Whereas rail and mass transit systems serve as an enticing target for terrorists and terrorist organizations, such as Al Qaeda, as evidenced by the March 11, 2004, attack on the Madrid, Spain, rail system, the July 7, 2005, attack on the London, England, mass transit system, the July 11, 2006, and November 26, 2008, attacks on the Mumbai, India, rail system, and the March 29, 2010, attack on the Moscow, Russia, mass transit system;   Whereas the Transportation Security Administration Authorization Act of 2009 , which was passed by the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on June 4, 2009, in an overwhelming and bipartisan manner, expresses Congress’ commitment to bolstering the security of rail and mass transit systems; and   Whereas securing our Nation’s rail and mass transit systems against terrorist attack and other security threats is essential due to their impact on our Nation’s economic stability and the continued functioning of our national economy: Now, therefore, be it
