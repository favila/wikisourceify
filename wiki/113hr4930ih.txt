 To amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act to provide States with the option of providing services to children with medically complex conditions under the Medicaid program and Children’s Health Insurance Program through a care coordination program focused on improving health outcomes for children with medically complex conditions and lowering costs, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
