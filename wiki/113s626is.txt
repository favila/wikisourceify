[[w:|Mr. Sanders]] introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To de-link research and development incentives from drug prices for new medicines to treat HIV/AIDS and to stimulate greater sharing of scientific knowledge.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act”.

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimates that more than 1,100,000 people are living with HIV in the United States, and that 1 in 5 of those people living with HIV is unaware of their infection.
:(2) An estimated 49,000 Americans become infected with HIV each year.
:(3) More than 15,000 people with AIDS still die each year in the United States.
:(4) Through 2010, more than 636,000 people with AIDS in the United States have died since the epidemic began.
:(5) Globally, UNAIDS estimates that more than 34,000,000 persons are living with HIV.
:(6) Persons with HIV/AIDS require access to antiretroviral drugs.
:(7) In the United States, public and private sector expenditures on antiretroviral drugs currently exceed $9,000,000,000 per year.
:(8) The United States Federal Government is the largest funder of treatments for HIV/AIDS in the developing world.
:(9) The development of new medicines and vaccines for HIV/AIDS is a national priority.
:(10) Market exclusivity for new products is an expensive, inefficient, and unfair mechanism to reward investments in new products, and has created hardships for persons with HIV/AIDS and businesses that employ persons with HIV/AIDS.
:(11) By de-linking research and development incentives from product prices, and by eliminating legal monopolies to sell new medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, it is possible to induce investments that are medically more important, procure products at low prices from competitive suppliers, and introduce more efficient incentives for research and development.

=Sec. 3. Purpose=

It is the purpose of this Act to provide sustainable financing of incentives to encourage investments in research and development of new medicines for HIV/AIDS and to share knowledge, data, materials, and technology, through the establishment of a Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS, while enhancing access to such medicines by eliminating legal monopolies on the manufacture, distribution, and sale of such medicines.
