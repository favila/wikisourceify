=Sec. 2. Statement of congressional findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) The passage of this Act recognizes that the primary tenets of its success depend on securing the sovereignty of the United States of America and establishing a coherent and just system for integrating those who seek to join American society.
:(2) We have a right, and duty, to maintain and secure our borders, and to keep our country safe and prosperous. As a Nation founded, built and sustained by immigrants we also have a responsibility to harness the power of that tradition in a balanced way that secures a more prosperous future for America.
:(3) We have always welcomed newcomers to the United States and will continue to do so. But in order to qualify for the honor and privilege of eventual citizenship, our laws must be followed. The world depends on America to be strong—economically, militarily and ethically. The establishment of a stable, just, and efficient immigration system only supports those goals. As a Nation, we have the right and responsibility to make our borders safe, to establish clear and just rules for seeking citizenship, to control the flow of legal immigration, and to eliminate illegal immigration, which in some cases has become a threat to our national security.

==Sec. 1119. Human Trafficking Reporting==



===(a) Short title– ===

This section may be cited as the“ Human Trafficking Reporting Act of 2013 ”.

===(b) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery.
:(2) According to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000  “severe forms of trafficking in persons”means—
::(A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or
::(B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.
:(3) There is an acute need for better data collection of incidents of human trafficking across the United States in order to effectively combat severe forms of trafficking in persons.
:(4) The State Department’s 2012 Trafficking in Persons report found that—
::(A) the United States is a“source, transit and destination country for men, women, and children, subjected to forced labor, debt bondage, domestic servitude and sex trafficking,”; and
::(B) the United States needs to“improve data collection on human trafficking cases at the federal, state and local levels”.
:(5) The [[w:International Organization for Migration|International Organization for Migration]]has reported that in order to effectively combat human trafficking there must be reliable and standardized data, however, the following barriers for data collection exist:
::(A) The illicit and underground nature of human trafficking.
::(B) The reluctance of victims to share information with authorities.
::(C) Insufficient human trafficking data collection and research efforts by governments worldwide.
:(6) A 2009 report to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]entitled Human Trafficking Into and Within the United States: A Review of the Literature found that“the data and methodologies for estimating the prevalence of human trafficking globally and nationally are not well developed, and therefore estimates have varied widely and changed significantly over time”.
:(7) The [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation]]compiles national crime statistics through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program.
:(8) Under current law, State and local governments receiving Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance grants are required to share data on part 1 violent crimes with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for inclusion in the Uniform Crime Reporting Program.
:(9) The addition of severe forms of trafficking in persons to the definition of part 1 violent crimes will ensure that statistics on this heinous crime will be compiled and available through the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Report.

===(c) Human trafficking To be included in part 1 violent crimes for purposes of Byrne grants– ===

   Section 505 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3755 42 U.S.C. 3755] )is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
