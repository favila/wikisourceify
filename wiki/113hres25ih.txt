Recognizing Linemen, the profession of Linemen, and the contributions of these brave men and women to protect public safety, and expressing support for designation of April 18, 2013, as National Lineman Appreciation Day.Whereas the profession of Linemen is steeped in personal, family, and professional tradition;Whereas Linemen are often first responders during storms and other catastrophic events where these brave men and women work to make the scene safe for the other public safety heroes;Whereas Linemen work with thousands of volts of electricity high atop power lines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to keep electricity flowing;Whereas Linemen must often work under dangerous conditions far from their families to construct and maintain the Nation’s energy infrastructure;Whereas Linemen put their lives on the line every day with little recognition or appreciation from the community regarding the danger of their work; andWhereas April 18, 2013, would be an appropriate date to designate as National Lineman Appreciation Day: Now, therefore, be it

= =
