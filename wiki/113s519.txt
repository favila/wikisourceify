To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to improve early education.

={{anchor|HC11C7A4568F54A2B8903C35CDD02B1B2}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Providing Resources Early for Kids Act of 2013”or the“PRE-K Act”.

={{anchor|HBFC01EDA4CB64801A4ED33E586F38F3D}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Children’s experiences in the first 5 years of life influence the developing brain and have a significant and lasting impact.
:(2) All children deserve access to high-quality early learning experiences that can support children's cognitive, social, and emotional development and help prepare children to succeed in school and in life.
:(3) Research shows that high-quality early education programs can improve early reading and early mathematics skills, decrease grade retention, decrease the need for special education services, and increase the likelihood that children will graduate from secondary school and become productive members of society.
:(4) The economic benefits of early education experiences are clear, and providing parents with greater access to high-quality early learning programs will benefit children, families, and our Nation.
:(5) High-quality early education programs have well-trained and well-compensated teachers, small class sizes, a full-day program, comprehensive services, family participation, and a research-based curriculum that aligns with strong early learning standards. The quality of State early education programs varies significantly across the United States.
:(6) While nearly three-quarters of children ages 3 through 5 who are not in kindergarten spend time in non-parental care each week, research suggests that most are not in high-quality settings that meet the full range of their developmental needs.
:(7) A Federal partnership with States—
::(A) will help increase access to voluntary, high-quality preschool programs;
::(B) is a necessary step to improving the Nation’s elementary and secondary schools and helping States close the achievement gap and improve graduation rates; and
::(C) should be a national priority.
