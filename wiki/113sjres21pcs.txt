{{Center|JOINT RESOLUTION}}

 To authorize the limited and specified use of the United States Armed Forces against Syria.    Whereas Syria is in material breach of the laws of war by having employed chemical weapons against its civilian population;   Whereas the abuses of the regime of Bashar al-Assad have included the brutal repression and war upon its own civilian population, resulting in more than 100,000 people killed in the past two years, 2,000,000 Syrian refugees in neighboring countries, and 4,500,000 internally displaced persons in Syria, creating an unprecedented regional crisis and instability;   Whereas the Assad regime has the largest chemical weapons programs in the region and has demonstrated its capability and willingness to repeatedly use weapons of mass destruction against its own people, including the August 21, 2013, attack in the suburbs of Damascus in which the Assad regime murdered over 1,000 innocent people, including hundreds of children;   Whereas there is clear and compelling evidence of the direct involvement of Assad regime forces and senior officials in the planning, execution, and after-action attempts to cover-up, the August 21, 2013, attack, and hide or destroy evidence of such attack;   Whereas the Arab League has declared with regards to the August 21, 2013, incident to hold the“Syrian regime responsible for this heinous crime”;   Whereas the [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]] , in Resolution 1540 (2004), affirmed that the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons constitutes a threat to international peace and security;   Whereas in the  Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 ( [[Public Law 108-175|Public Law 108–175]]  ), [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] found that Syria’s acquisition of weapons of mass destruction threatens the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States;   Whereas the actions and conduct of the Assad regime are in direct contravention of Syria's legal obligations under the United Nations Charter, the Geneva Conventions, and the Protocol to the Hague Convention on the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, done at Geneva June 17, 1925, and also violate the standards set forth in the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, done at Paris January 13, 1993;   Whereas Syria's use of weapons of mass destruction and its conduct and actions constitute a grave threat to regional stability, world peace, and the national security interests of the United States and its allies and partners;   Whereas the objectives of the United States use of military force in connection with this authorization are to respond to the use, and deter and degrade the potential future use, of weapons of mass destruction by the Government of Syria;   Whereas, on May 21, 2013, the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate]] passed by a 15-3 vote the Syria Transition Support Act (S. 960) , which found that the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President's]] goals of Assad leaving power, an end to the violence, and a negotiated political settlement in Syria are prerequisites for a stable, democratic future for Syria and regional peace and security, but absent decisive changes to the present military balance of power on the ground in Syria, sufficient incentives do not yet exist for the achievement of such goals; and   Whereas the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] has authority under the Constitution to use force in order to defend the national security interests of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
