=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Violent Content Research Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Study; National Academy of Sciences=



==(a) In general– ==

Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] , the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] , and the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] , jointly, shall undertake to enter into appropriate arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study and investigation of—
:(1) whether there is a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children; and
:(2) whether there is a connection between exposure to violent video programming and harmful effects on children.

==(b) Contents of study and investigation– ==



===(1) Violent video games– ===

The study and investigation under subsection (a)shall include—
:(A) whether the exposure listed under subsection (a)(1)—
::(i) causes children to act aggressively or causes other measurable harm to children;
::(ii) has a disproportionately harmful effect on children already prone to aggressive behavior or on other identifiable groups of children; and
::(iii) has a harmful effect that is distinguishable from any negative effects produced by other types of media;
:(B) whether any harm identified under subparagraph (A)(i)has a direct and long-lasting impact on a child's well-being; and
:(C) whether current or emerging characteristics of video games have a unique impact on children, considering in particular video games' interactive nature and the extraordinarily personal and vivid way violence might be portrayed in such video games.

===(2) Violent video programming– ===

The study and investigation under subsection (a)shall include—
:(A) whether the exposure listed under subsection (a)(2)—
::(i) causes children to act aggressively or causes other measurable harm to children;
::(ii) has a disproportionately harmful effect on children already prone to aggressive behavior or on other identifiable groups of children; and
::(iii) has a harmful effect that is distinguishable from any negative effects produced by other types of media; and
:(B) whether any harm identified under subparagraph (A)(i)has a direct and long-lasting impact on a child's well-being.

===(3) Future research– ===

The study and investigation under subsection (a)shall identify gaps in the current state of research which, if closed, could provide additional information regarding any causal connection—
:(A) between exposure to violent video games and behavior; and
:(B) between exposure to violent video programming and behavior.

==(c) Report– ==

In entering into any arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences for conducting the study and investigation under this section, the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] , the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] , and the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] shall request the National Academy of Sciences to submit, not later than 15 months after the date on which such arrangements are completed, a report on the results of the study and investigation to—
:(1)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] ;
:(2) the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] ;
:(3) the [[w:Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications Commission]] ; and
:(4) the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] .
