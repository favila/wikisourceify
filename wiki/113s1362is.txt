{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to establish a permanent background check system.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Child Protection Improvements and Electronic Life and Safety Security Systems Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System of the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains fingerprints and criminal history records on more than 71,000,000 individuals.
:(2)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has worked with the States to make criminal history background checks available to organizations seeking to screen employees and volunteers who work with children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities, through the National Child Protection Act of 1993( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/5119 42 U.S.C. 5119 et seq.] ), the Volunteers for Children Act([[Public Law 105-251|Public Law 105–251]] ;112 Stat. 1885), the Serve America Act([[Public Law 111-13|Public Law 111–13]] ;123 Stat. 1460), the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006([[Public Law 109-248|Public Law 109–248]] ;120 Stat. 587), and statutes enacted by 48 states in compliance with[[Public Law 92-544|Public Law 92–544]] . However, there may still be persons providing care and services to children who fall outside these numerous and broad categories of criminal history background checks authorized by Federal and State law.
:(3) The electronic life safety and security systems industry provides commercial buildings, public agencies and private residences with alarm, security and central monitoring systems to help prevent crime. These systems may be installed by individual employer-owned companies and other private sector businesses.
:(4) Although 18 States currently have legislation, enacted under[[Public Law 92-544|Public Law 92–544]] , to authorize criminal history background checks on individuals in burglar alarm installation and related professions, most States do not require a criminal history background check. To protect lives and property, individuals in the electronic life safety and security systems industry should undergo a State and national criminal history background check.

=Sec. 3. Background checks=
