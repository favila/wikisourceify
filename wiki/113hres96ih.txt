{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing support for designation of the week of March 3 through 9, 2013, as “School Social Work Week” .Whereas the importance of school social work through the inclusion of school social work programs has been recognized in the current authorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] )and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1400 20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.] );Whereas school social workers serve as vital members of a school’s educational team, playing a central role in creating a positive school climate and vital partnerships between the home, school, and community to ensure student academic success;Whereas school social workers are especially skilled in providing services to students who face serious challenges to school success, including poverty, disability, discrimination, abuse, addiction, bullying, divorce of parents, loss of a loved one, and other barriers to learning;Whereas there is a growing need for local educational agencies to offer the mental health services that school social workers provide when working with families, teachers, principals, community agencies, and other entities to address students’ emotional, physical, and environmental needs so that students may achieve behavioral and academic success;Whereas to achieve the goal of helping all children reach their optimal levels of potential and achievement schools must work to remove the emotional, behavioral, and academic barriers that interfere with student success in school;Whereas fewer than 1 in 5 of the children in need of mental health services actually receive these services, and research indicates that school mental health programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, decreasing discipline referrals, and improving academic achievement;Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early identification of mental health problems and in the provision of appropriate services when needed; andWhereas the celebration of School Social Work Week during the week of March 3 through 9, 2013, highlights the vital role school social workers play in the lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
