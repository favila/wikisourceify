			 required to carry out the obligations set forth in Public Law 104–121.
:(2) The debt obligations held by the Social
			 Security trust fund may only be redeemed in order to pay Social Security
			 benefits and necessary administrative expenses.
:(3) So long as there is a positive balance of
			 assets in the Social Security trust fund, an appropriate amount of obligations
			 may be converted into an equal amount of publicly held debt in order to finance
			 the full and timely payment of all Social Security obligations without
			 exceeding the debt ceiling.
