This Act may be cited as the “Levee Vegetation Review Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Flood control policy=



==(a) Review– ==

In order to determine whether current Federal policy relating to levee vegetation is appropriate for all regions of the United States, the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary of the Army]] shall undertake a comprehensive review of the [[w:United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] policy guidelines on vegetation management for levees (in this section referred to as the guidelines ).

==(b) Factors– ==



===(1) In general– ===

In conducting the review, the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary]] shall examine the guidelines in view of—
:(A) the varied interests and responsibilities in managing flood risks, including the need to provide the greatest levee safety benefit with limited resources;
:(B) preserving, protecting, and enhancing natural resources, including the potential benefit that vegetation on levees can have in providing habitat for species of concern;
:(C) protecting the rights of Native Americans pursuant to treaties and statutes; and
:(D) such other factors as the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary]] considers appropriate.

===(2) Regional and watershed considerations– ===

In conducting the review, the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary]] shall specifically consider factors that promote and allow for consideration of potential variances from national guidelines on a regional or watershed basis. Such factors may include regional or watershed soil conditions, hydrologic factors, vegetation patterns and characteristics, environmental resources, levee performance history, institutional considerations, and other relevant factors. The scope of a variance approved by the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary]] may include an exemption to national guidelines where appropriate.

==(c) Cooperation and consultation; recommendations– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The review shall be undertaken in cooperation with interested Federal agencies and in consultation with interested representatives of State and local governments, Native American Indian tribes, appropriate nongovernmental organizations, and the public.

===(2) Recommendations– ===

Corps of Engineers Regional Integration Teams, representing districts, divisions, and headquarters, in consultation with State and Federal resources agencies, and with participation by local agencies, shall recommend to the Chief of Engineers vegetation management policies for levees that conform with State and Federal laws and other applicable requirements.

==(d) Peer review– ==



===(1) Views of National Academy of Engineering– ===

As part of the review, the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary]] shall solicit and consider the views of the National Academy of Engineering on the engineering, environmental, and institutional considerations underlying the guidelines.

===(2) Availability of views– ===

The views of the National Academy of Engineering obtained under paragraph (1)shall be—
:(A) made available to the public; and
:(B) included in supporting materials issued in connection with the revised guidelines required under subsection (e).

:(A) revise the guidelines based on the results of the review, including the results of the peer review conducted under subsection (d); and
:(B) submit to Congress a report that contains a summary of the activities of the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary]] and a description of the findings of the [[w:21st Theater Army Area Command|Secretary]] under this section.

===(2) Content; incorporation into manual– ===

The revised guidelines shall—
:(A) provide a practical process for approving regional or watershed variances from the national guidelines, reflecting due consideration of measures to maximize public safety benefits with limited resources, regional climatic variations, environmental quality, implementation challenges, and allocation of responsibilities; and
:(B) be incorporated into the manual proposed under section 5(c) of the Act entitled “An Act authorizing the construction of certain public works on rivers and harbors for flood control, and for other purposes” , approved August 18, 1941 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/701n 33 U.S.C. 701n(c)] ).
