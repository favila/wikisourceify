=={{anchor|H1D14F42E1DF340FBA227DBADB674AAFC}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) the manufacture, distribution, and importation of firearms is inherently commercial in nature;
:(2) firearms regularly move in interstate commerce;
:(3) to the extent that firearms trafficking is intrastate in nature, it arises out of and is substantially connected with a commercial transaction, which, when viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce;
:(4) because the intrastate and interstate trafficking of firearms are so commingled, full regulation of interstate commerce requires the incidental regulation of intrastate commerce;
:(5) gun violence in the United States is associated with the majority of homicides, over half the suicides, and two-thirds of non-fatal violent injuries; and
:(6) on the afternoon of May 10, 2007, Blair Holt, a junior at Julian High School in Chicago, was killed on a public bus riding home from school when he used his body to shield a girl who was in the line of fire after a young man boarded the bus and started shooting.

=={{anchor|HD2E908A1942C49D4A39D59DF47A9266B}}(b) Sense of the Congress– ==

It is the sense of the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) firearms trafficking is prevalent and widespread in and among the States, and it is usually impossible to distinguish between intrastate trafficking and interstate trafficking; and
:(2) it is in the national interest and within the role of the Federal Government to ensure that the regulation of firearms is uniform among the States, that law enforcement can quickly and effectively trace firearms used in crime, and that firearms owners know how to use and safely store their firearms.

=={{anchor|HEBB12D599DB6422A9824C64162E53F30}}(c) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Actand the amendments made by this Actare—
:(1) to protect the public against the unreasonable risk of injury and death associated with the unrecorded sale or transfer of qualifying firearms to criminals and youth;
:(2) to ensure that owners of qualifying firearms are knowledgeable in the safe use, handling, and storage of those firearms;
:(3) to restrict the availability of qualifying firearms to criminals, youth, and other persons prohibited by Federal law from receiving firearms; and
:(4) to facilitate the tracing of qualifying firearms used in crime by Federal and State law enforcement agencies.
