=====(A) Additional residency positions– =====



======(i) In general– ======

For each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019 (and succeeding fiscal years if the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] determines that there are additional residency positions available to distribute under clause (iii)(II)), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall increase the otherwise applicable resident limit for each qualifying hospital that submits a timely application under this subparagraph by such number as the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may approve for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after July 1 of the fiscal year of the increase. Except as provided in clause (iii), the aggregate number of increases in the otherwise applicable resident limit under this subparagraph shall be equal to 3,000 in each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019, of which at least 1,500 in each such fiscal year shall be used for full-time equivalent residents training in a shortage specialty residency program (as defined in subparagraph (F)(iii)).

======(ii) Process for distributing positions– ======



=======(I) Rounds of applications– =======

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall initiate 5 separate rounds of applications for an increase under clause (i), 1 round with respect to each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019.

=======(II) Number available– =======

In each of such rounds, the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the fiscal year as a result of an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit (as described in clause (i)) shall be distributed, plus any additional positions available under clause (iii).

=======(III) Timing– =======

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall notify hospitals of the number of positions distributed to the hospital under this paragraph as result of an increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit by January 1 of the fiscal year of the increase. Such increase shall be effective for portions of cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1 of that fiscal year.

======(iii) Positions not distributed during the fiscal year– ======



=======(I) In general– =======

If the number of resident full-time equivalent positions distributed under this paragraph in a fiscal year is less than the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the fiscal year (as described in clause (i), including after application of this subclause), the difference between such number distributed and such number available for distribution shall be added to the aggregate number of positions available for distribution in the following fiscal year.

=======(II) Exception if positions not distributed by end of fiscal year 2019– =======

If the aggregate number of positions distributed under this paragraph during the 5-year period of fiscal years 2015 through 2019 is less than 15,000, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall, in accordance with the considerations described in subparagraph (B)(i)and the priority described in subparagraph (B)(ii), conduct an application and distribution process in each subsequent fiscal year until such time as the aggregate amount of positions distributed under this paragraph is equal to 15,000.

=====(B) Distribution to certain hospitals– =====



======(i) Consideration in distribution– ======

In determining for which hospitals the increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit is provided under subparagraph (A), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall take into account the demonstrated likelihood of the hospital filling the positions made available under this paragraph within the first 5 cost reporting periods beginning after the date the increase would be effective, as determined by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] .

======(ii) Priority for certain hospitals– ======

Subject to clause (iii), in determining for which hospitals the increase in the otherwise applicable resident limit is provided under subparagraph (A), the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] shall distribute the increase in the following priority order:
:(I) First, to hospitals in States with (aa) new medical schools that received “Candidate School” status from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education or that received “Pre-Accreditation” status from the American Osteopathic Association Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation on or after January 1, 2000, and that have achieved or continue to progress toward “Full Accreditation” status (as such term is defined by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education) or toward “Accreditation” status (as such term is defined by the American Osteopathic Association Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation), or (bb) additional locations and branch campuses established on or after January 1, 2000, by medical schools with “Full Accreditation” status (as such term is defined by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education) or “Accreditation” status (as such term is defined by the American Osteopathic Association Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation).
:(II) Second, to hospitals in which the resident level of the hospital is greater than the otherwise applicable resident limit during the most recent cost reporting period ending on or before the date of enactment of this paragraph.
:(III) Third, to hospitals that emphasize training in community health center or community-based settings or in hospital outpatient departments.
:(IV) Fourth, to hospitals that are eligible for incentive payments under section 1886(n)or 1903(t)as of the date the hospital submits an application for such increase under subparagraph (A).
:(V) Fifth, to all other hospitals.

======(iii) Distribution to hospitals in higher priority group prior to distribution in lower priority groups– ======

The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] may only distribute an increase under subparagraph (A)to a lower priority group under clause (ii)if all qualifying hospitals in the higher priority group or groups have received the maximum number of increases under such subparagraph that the hospital is eligible for under this paragraph for the fiscal year.

:(II) the total number of full-time equivalent residents, excluding any additional positions attributable to such increase, is not less than the average number of full-time equivalent residents during the 3 most recent cost reporting periods ending on or before the effective date of such increase; and
:(III) the ratio of full-time equivalent residents in a shortage specialty residency program (as so defined) is not less than the average ratio of full-time equivalent residents in such a program during the 3 most recent cost reporting periods ending on or before the effective date of such increase.
