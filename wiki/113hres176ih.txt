Whereas, in the aftermath of the deadly bombings that occurred on Patriots’ Day, April 15, 2013, during the running of the 117th Boston Marathon, the residents of Massachusetts and the people of the United States witnessed the incredible bravery, dedication, and sacrifice of law enforcement officers, first responders, and citizen heroes;   Whereas Sean Collier of Wilmington, Massachusetts, an officer in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Police Department, gave his life in the line of duty, the ultimate sacrifice, during this ordeal;   Whereas Officer Sean Collier was protecting the students of MIT when he was killed as he sat in his police cruiser;   Whereas Officer Sean Collier was known by his family, friends, and co-workers as a generous, kind, friendly, and devoted individual and officer who was on the cusp of achieving his dream of joining the Somerville Police Force;   Whereas the people of the United States join with the family of Officer Sean Collier, MIT colleagues and friends, the Wilmington community he grew up in, and fellow Salem State alumni who will always remember Officer Collier as a dedicated, hardworking, and respected young police officer;   Whereas the people of the United States remember Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy from Dorchester, Massachusetts;   Whereas Martin Richard loved to play sports and draw pictures, and was dearly loved by his family, friends, classmates, and community;   Whereas the people of the United States will always remember and strive to live by Martin’s poignant and powerful message of No more hurting people.
