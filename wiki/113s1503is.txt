<blockquote> 

===(F) School personnel administration of epinephrine– ===

In determining the preference (if any) to be given to a State under this subsection, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall give additional preference to a State that provides to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]the certification described in subparagraph (G) and that requires that each public elementary school and secondary school in the State—
:(i) permits trained personnel of the school to administer epinephrine to any student of the school reasonably believed to be having an anaphylactic reaction;
:(ii) maintains a supply of epinephrine in a secure location that is easily accessible to trained personnel of the school for the purpose of administration to any student of the school reasonably believed to be having an anaphylactic reaction; and
:(iii) has in place a plan for having on the premises of the school during all operating hours of the school one or more individuals who are trained personnel of the school. 

===(G) Civil liability protection law– ===

The certification required in subparagraph (F) shall be a certification made by the State attorney general that the State has reviewed any applicable civil liability protection law to determine the application of such law with regard to elementary and secondary school trained personnel who may administer epinephrine to a student reasonably believed to be having an anaphylactic reaction and has concluded that such law provides adequate civil liability protection applicable to such trained personnel. For purposes of the previous sentence, the term civil liability protection law means a State law offering legal protection to individuals who give aid on a voluntary basis in an emergency to an individual who is ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. ; and

:::(ii) who has received training in the administration of epinephrine; and
