      Findings
      
        
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
             finds as follows:
			
        (1)
        Breast cancer
			 accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in this country.
			
      
        (2)
        The survival rate
			 for breast cancer has increased to 90 percent for White women and 78 percent
			 for African-American women.
			
      
        (3)
        African-American
			 women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced
			 stages of breast cancer despite a lower incidence rate.
			
      
        (4)
        Early detection
			 for breast cancer increases survival rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a
			 5-year relative survival rate of 98 percent for breast cancers that are
			 discovered before the cancer spreads beyond the breast, compared to 23 percent
			 for stage IV breast cancers.
			
      
        (5)
        Triple-negative
			 breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have
			 estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the
			 HER2 protein on their sources.
			
      
        (6)
        It is estimated
			 that between 10 and 20 percent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed
			 with triple-negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of
			 triple-negative breast cancer is much higher.
			
      
        (7)
        Triple-negative
			 breast cancer most commonly affects African-American women, followed by
			 Hispanic women.
			
      
        (8)
        Triple-negative
			 breast cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer which affects women under the
			 age of 50 across all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.
			
      
        (9)
        African-American
			 women are 3 times more likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer than
			 White women.
			
      
        (10)
        Triple-negative
			 breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than most other types of
			 breast cancer.
			
      
        (11)
        Like other forms
			 of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer is treated with surgery,
			 radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
			
      
        (12)
        Early-stage
			 detection of triple-negative breast cancer is the key to survival because the
			 tumor cells lack certain receptors, and neither hormone therapy nor drugs that
			 target these receptors are effective against these cancers; therefore, early
			 detection and education is vital.
			
      
        (13)
        Current research
			 and available data do not provide adequate information on—
				
          (A)
          the rates of
			 prevalence and incidence of triple-negative breast cancer in African-American,
			 Hispanic, and other minority women;
				
        
          (B)
          he costs
			 associated with treating triple-negative breast cancer; and
				
        
          (C)
          the methods by
			 which triple-negative breast cancer may be prevented or cured in these
			 women.
