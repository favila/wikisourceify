To provide for research and education with respect to triple-negative breast cancer, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2013”.

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds as follows:
: Breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in this country.: The survival rate for breast cancer has increased to 90 percent for White women and 78 percent for African-American women.: African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer despite a lower incidence rate.: Early detection for breast cancer increases survival rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a 5-year relative survival rate of 98 percent for breast cancers that are discovered before the cancer spreads beyond the breast, compared to 23 percent for stage IV breast cancers.: Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their sources.: It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer is much higher.: Triple-negative breast cancer most commonly affects African-American women, followed by Hispanic women.: Triple-negative breast cancer is a very aggressive form of cancer which affects women under the age of 50 across all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.: African-American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer than White women.: Triple-negative breast cancer tends to grow and spread more quickly than most other types of breast cancer.: Like other forms of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.: Early-stage detection of triple-negative breast cancer is the key to survival because the tumor cells lack certain receptors, and neither hormone therapy nor drugs that target these receptors are effective against these cancers; therefore, early detection and education is vital.: Current research and available data do not provide adequate information on—:: the rates of prevalence and incidence of triple-negative breast cancer in African-American, Hispanic, and other minority women;:: he costs associated with treating triple-negative breast cancer; and:: the methods by which triple-negative breast cancer may be prevented or cured in these women.
