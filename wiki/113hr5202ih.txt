Such letter shall identify the information accessed and the name of the entity who accessed the information.

==(c) Contact information– ==

The [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Director of the Office of Management and Budget]]—
:(1) may obtain the contact information used to notify an individual by letter described in subsection (b) from sources including a driver’s license and voter registration; and
