To provide financing assistance for qualified water infrastructure projects, and for other purposes.

={{anchor|HF55481DE7EFA434D8D72527023601CC1}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2013”.

={{anchor|HC398EB922CEE4E538219B14102867581}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) it is in the national interest to encourage the timely and cost-effective rehabilitation and replacement of aging water and sewer infrastructure and to support investments in innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable infrastructure approaches to protect public health and clean water;
:(2) the Environmental Protection Agency reports that, in the 20-year period following the date of enactment of this Act—
::(A) $334,800,000,000 is needed to invest in infrastructure improvements to ensure the provision of safe water; and
::(B) $298,100,000,000 is needed for publicly owned wastewater systems-related infrastructure;
:(3) customer rates and local charges are and will remain the primary means of paying for water service and infrastructure in the United States;
:(4) the municipal bond market and State revolving fund programs are the primary long-term means for financing water infrastructure projects, but upfront investment needs are too high to be met with those traditional means alone;
:(5) financing constraints make it particularly difficult for State revolving funds to support large water infrastructure projects of regional and national significance;
:(6) the growing funding gap demonstrates the need to invest in innovative and cost-effective approaches such as green infrastructure, water efficiency, and source water protection to obtain the greatest environmental and public health benefits per dollar invested;
:(7) this Act will substantially benefit the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States by—
::(A) addressing the gap in funding for large, regionally and nationally significant projects by making available direct loans and loan guarantees to reduce borrowing costs and accelerate water infrastructure investment;
::(B) enhancing the capacity of State revolving fund programs to assist other projects; and
::(C) promoting clean and safe water through compliance with theFederal Water Pollution Control Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1251 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.] )and the Safe Drinking Water Act([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300f 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.] );
:(8) since the historical default rate on water and sewer bonds is 0.04 percent, the risk of default on Federal assistance provided under this Act is minimal;
:(9) keeping the risk of default on water and sewer bonds low requires the alignment of infrastructure investment with environmental sustainability; and
:(10) because loans, loan guarantees, and other credit instruments only incur long-term costs if subsidized or in the event of default, this Act can help to meet the water infrastructure needs of the United States at minimal long-term cost to the Federal Government.
