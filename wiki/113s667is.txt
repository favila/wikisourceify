A variance described in this subparagraph is a variance from compliance with the adequate land use and control measures required to be adopted in an area (or subdivision thereof) pursuant to paragraph (1) that allows for the repair and restoration of an eligible structure to its predamaged condition without elevation of the structure, after an appropriate State or local authority determines that—

:(ii) suspend an area (or subdivision thereof) from participation in the national flood insurance program or place an area (or subdivision thereof) on probation under the national flood insurance program because the area has adopted land use and control measures that permit the granting of a variance in accordance with this paragraph. .
