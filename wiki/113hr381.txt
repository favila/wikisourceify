={{anchor|H9FC250D83F854D49BB0258470165F696}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The bedrock of the Nation’s economic strength and future growth will be directly attributed to the robust Federal investment in critical areas such as education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
:(2) Recognizing the importance of education and its role in maintaining America’s position as an economic global leader, President George H.W. Bush stated that“U.S. students must be the first in the world in math and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen.”.
:(3) As President Bill Clinton recognized when he created the National Economic Council in 1992,“The currency of national strength in this new era will be denominated not only in ships and tanks and planes, but in diplomas and patents and paychecks.”.
:(4) Recognizing diplomas and patents will not occur without investing in education, President George W. Bush stated that“we must address the low standing of American test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science, the very subjects most likely to affect our future competitiveness.”.
:(5) Similarly, President Obama has stated that America’s future economic growth and international competitiveness depend on our Nation’s willingness to educate, invest, and innovate.
:(6) As stated in a recent report from the National Economic Council, the Nation must“create the jobs and industries of the future by doing what America does best—investing in the creativity and imagination of our people. To win the future, we must out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.”.
:(7) Accordingly, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] should be provided the means to evaluate legislative worth beyond its impact to the annual budget.
