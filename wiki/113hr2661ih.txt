=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Veterans Access to Timely Medical Appointments Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] is statutorily obligated to provide eligible individuals who served in the Armed Forces with access to health care and benefits provided by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] related to such service.
:(2) The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] has given the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] the goal of scheduling a primary care medical appointment within seven days of the date requested by the patient and or the provider and scheduling a specialty care medical appointment within fourteen days of the date requested by the patient and or the provider.
:(3) The ability of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] to accurately schedule and provide timely access to medical appointments is critical to ensure the health care needs of veterans are met and medical conditions do not worsen because of delays in receiving medical treatment.
:(4) An audit by the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General of the United States]] found that medical appointment wait times reported by the [[w:Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Health Administration]] of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] are unreliable.
:(5) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] found that without reliable measurement of how long patients are waiting for medical appointments, the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] is not able to identify areas that need improvement and therefore cannot mitigate problems that contribute to wait times.
:(6) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] found that the unreliable data and measures for wait times create a discrepancy between the positive results the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] publishes and what veterans actually experience.
:(7) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] found that the [[w:Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Health Administration]] inconsistently implements its scheduling policy across medical centers of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] , which impedes scheduling timely medical appointments.
:(8) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] found that oversight of compliance with such scheduling policy, such as ensuring the completion of required scheduler training, was inconsistent across facilities.
:(9) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] found that the management by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] of telephone service, including lack of staff dedicated to answering phones and unreturned phone calls, impede veterans’ access to timely medical appointments.
:(10) Among the four medical centers of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] reviewed by the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] , patient complaints regarding unreturned phone calls ranked among the top two categories of complaints during fiscal year 2012.
:(11) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]] found that in January 2012, the [[w:Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Health Administration]] distributed best practices for telephone access that, if implemented, could help improve telephone access to clinical care.
:(12) The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] is not meeting the statutory obligations of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] to provide veterans with timely access to medical appointments so that such veterans can receive benefits and health care by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]] in a timely manner.
