=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress makes the following findings:
:(1) Obstetric fistula is a catastrophic childbirth injury which arises as a complication of obstructed labor.
:(2) An estimated 2 to 3 million women currently are afflicted by the devastating physical and social effects of obstetric fistula—a scourge of epidemic proportions. As many as 130,000 new cases occur each year.
:(3) Historically, obstetric fistula affected women in the United States and around the world. Advances in obstetric care and access to improved surgical techniques resulted in a drastic reduction in obstetric fistula by the early 20th century in the United States.
:(4) Today, obstetric fistula primarily affects the poorest women in the poorest parts of the world. It disproportionately affects women in sub-Saharan Africa and girls—some as young as 13 years old—who are subjected to child marriage and whose bodies are not fully capable of handling the demands of childbirth. Many of these young girls and women have been subjected to female genital mutilation, which can increase the risk for and be a direct cause of obstetric fistula.
:(5) Obstetric fistula, which usually results in fetal death by asphyxia, occurs when the tissues that normally separate a woman’s vagina from her bladder or rectum are destroyed by prolonged pressure from the fetal head trapped in the birth canal.
:(6) Obstetric fistula typically occurs because a woman does not have access to emergency obstetric care or because she does not have the financial means, transportation, or access to surgical repair.
:(7) Left untreated, an obstetric fistula afflicts a woman with devastating physical conditions: incontinence, painful ulcers, and constant and uncontrollable emission of offensive odors. These symptoms leave a woman indelibly and perpetually stigmatized by her condition.
:(8) Because obstetric fistula does not heal on its own, women affected by this condition are marginalized for the remainder of their lives. Expelled from their communities and denied education and health care, obstetric fistula victims are left in desperate economic circumstances.
:(9) Victims also suffer social ostracism that results in involuntary divorce, exclusion from religious activities, deepening poverty, malnutrition, deteriorating physical health, depression, and despair. As a result, victims are left defenseless and vulnerable.
:(10) This social isolation compounds already existing problems such as illiteracy and lack of economic opportunities.
:(11) Because obstetric fistula are not themselves fatal, millions of women live with this horrific condition and have been overlooked by the international medical community. At present, humanitarian aid and nongovernmental programs treat fistula cases on a small scale and are not equipped to systematically prevent, treat, and eradicate obstetric fistula.
:(12) Obstetric fistula can be prevented when women and their families are educated about the birthing process and are provided access to emergency obstetric care.
:(13) Today, doctors can surgically repair obstetric fistula with a low-cost, low-technology surgery.
:(14) The impact of an obstetric fistula-repair surgery is immediate and consequential. Women can be re-integrated into society and are afforded basic human necessities such as familial relationships, health care, and the opportunity to earn a living.
:(15) The prevention, treatment, and ultimately the eradication of obstetric fistula will advance the emancipation and empowerment of women, strengthen families and communities, and improve the overall economic, educational, and social well-being of affected societies.
:(16) Basic interventions to identify and repair obstetric fistula have achieved meaningful and cost-effective results.
:(17) The best available data suggests that existing programs can only repair 10 percent of new obstetric fistula cases each year, and less than 1 percent of existing obstetric fistula cases are repaired each year.
:(18) The challenge is to expand existing pilot programs into a scalable, comprehensive, and sustainable campaign to eradicate obstetric fistula.
:(19) Nongovernmental organizations with experience in obstetric care, surgery, and women’s rights have proven effective in making progress towards eliminating the scourge of obstetric fistula and can be a resource in assisting indigenous organizations in severely afflicted countries in their efforts to treat and care for women with obstetric fistula.
:(20) The nature of obstetric fistula—and the fact that it affects vulnerable women in poor and isolated communities which offer little or no access to obstetric care—demands a comprehensive, coordinated, long-term, international response focused on the prevention and treatment of obstetric fistula, including—
::(A) safe-childbirth education and obstetric fistula prevention, care, and treatment; post-operative care, including rehabilitation, social reintegration, and post-surgical follow-up; basic and applied research and clinical work; and training of health care workers and educators, particularly local, grassroots educators and medical workers;
::(B) designation of a university-based medical center in the United States, designated as the International Obstetric Fistula Institute for Sub-Saharan Africa established under section 5(d) , responsible for marshaling surgical and other necessary health resources to effectuate the campaign against obstetric fistula; for building prevention and treatment capacity in sub-Saharan Africa, including coordinating partnerships with sub-Saharan African institutions and governments; and for developing and managing community education and mobilization programs at home and abroad;
::(C) development of health care infrastructure and delivery systems through Centers of Clinical Excellence for Obstetric Fistula Care for Sub-Saharan Africa as well as through cooperative and coordinated public efforts and public-private partnerships;
::(D) strengthening universities, research centers, and training programs for health professionals through institutional capacity-building partnerships;
::(E) development and implementation of a United States Obstetric Fistula Treatment and Prevention Corps which recruits and trains doctors—especially obstetricians, gynecologists, urologists, general surgeons, and anesthesiologists—nurses, and other community-development and public-health personnel to serve regions affected by obstetric fistula and which partners United States medical professionals with sub-Saharan African professionals, promoting a joint effort to eradicate this devastating condition;
::(F) coordination of efforts to make the treatment of obstetric fistula a higher priority in sub-Saharan African hospitals, specifically aimed at ameliorating the paucity of training related to obstetric fistula treatment; and
::(G) coordination of efforts between the medical community, nongovernmental organizations, national governments, and private sector organizations, including faith-based organizations.
:(21) The United States has the capacity to lead and enhance the effectiveness of the international community’s response by—
::(A) providing substantial resources, medical expertise, and training, particularly of health care personnel and community workers and leaders;
::(B) making United States surgeons and health care professionals available to serve, train, and build workforce capacity in afflicted countries through a United States Obstetric Fistula Treatment and Prevention Corps;
::(C) encouraging governments and faith-based and community organizations to adopt policies that treat obstetric fistula and its causes as a multi-sector, public-health problem that profoundly affects women’s health, women’s empowerment, education, the economy, and promotion of strong and successful families;
::(D) encouraging education about healthy practices, including education about the health risks associated with child marriage and female genital mutilation;
::(E) building successful communities by preventing obstetric fistula and the ensuing social stigma which often separates an obstetric fistula victim from her family;
::(F) contributing to public health and health-care delivery system research to improve obstetric fistula prevention, treatment, and reintegration;
::(G) encouraging active involvement and cooperation across sectors, including the medical and scientific communities, charitable foundations, private and voluntary organizations and nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations, community-based organizations, and other not-for-profit entities; and
::(H) engaging in medical diplomacy, with a particular focus on the further empowerment and emancipation of women.
:(22) Unaddressed obstetric emergencies and untreated obstetric fistula result in the needless, systematic degradation and marginalization of women. It should be the policy of the United States to help eradicate this preventable and curable condition.
:(23) Strong coordination must exist among the implementing agencies of the United States to ensure effective and efficient use of financial, medical, and technical resources within the United States Government with respect to international obstetric fistula eradication.
:(24) Obstetric fistula is a medical condition which historically affected women around the globe. The United States long ago eliminated this needlessly oppressive condition because of access to skilled medical professionals and medical care. Obstetric fistula can be prevented and repaired. No woman should suffer a lifetime of debilitating physical and social consequences—as obstetric fistula victims do—simply because she lacks access to basic obstetric care.
