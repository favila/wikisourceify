:(3) the units of the [[w:National Park Service|National Park System]]that were temporarily reopened using State funds also collected gate entry fees;
:(4) the Government shutdown ended when Congress passed the  Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 ([[Public Law 113-46|Public Law 113–46]] ), which retroactively funded Federal agencies and Federal employee salaries for the period of time during which the Government was shut down;
:(5) by virtue of the retroactive appropriation made by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]], the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]]retained an unintended shutdown windfall from the States listed in paragraph (1) of approximately $2,000,000; and
