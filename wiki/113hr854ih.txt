=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On January 19, 1984, the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] determined that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.
:(2) The Qods Force is the elite external operations branch of the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Iranian regime’s primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad.
:(3) The Qods Force provides aid in the form of weapons, training, and funding to Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups, Lebanese Hizballah, Iraq-based militants, and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.
:(4) The Qods Force is behind some of the deadliest terrorist attacks of the past three decades, including the 1983 and 1984 bombings of the United States Embassy and annex in Beirut, the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, 1994 attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.
:(5) In 2007, President George W. Bush and General David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, accused Iran’s Qods Force of aiding militias in killing American soldiers in Iraq.
:(6) In 2007, the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]] designated the Qods Force for providing material support to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations.
:(7) On October 25, 2007, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force was sanctioned under Executive Order 13382, for supporting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
:(8)   Section 1258 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 expressed the sense of Congress that“the United States should designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization under  section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1189 8 U.S.C. 1189])and place the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, as established under the  International Emergency Economic Powers Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.])and initiated under Executive Order 13224 (September 23, 2001)”.
