A number of articles, if similarly packaged and bearing identical labels, shall be considered as one product, but each package size, form, or differently labeled article shall be considered a separate product.

====(d) Identification and publication of list of products containing anabolic steroids– ====


:(1) The [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]]may, in his discretion, collect data and analyze products to determine whether they contain anabolic steroids and are properly labeled in accordance with this section.
