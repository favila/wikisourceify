			 title– ==

This Act may be cited

=={{anchor|H9C82D4E2B39F426F8F2953FFF4C37C7D}}(b) Findings– ==

[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]]
			 finds the following:
:(1) On April 4, 2011, the [[Wikipedia:Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme
			 Court]] ruled that opponents of Arizona’s private school scholarship tax credit
			 program may not challenge the program on grounds that it violates the
			 Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
:(2) The [[Wikipedia:Supreme Court of the United States|Court]] ruled
			 5–4 in Garriott v. Winn and Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v.
			 Winn against a lawsuit by the Arizona chapter of the American Civil Liberties
			 Union, which contested a tax credit program giving Arizona parents choices
			 other than their neighborhood public schools.
:(3) The
			 Children’s Hope Act of 2013
			 builds on the success of the Arizona private school scholarship tax credit
			 program. Thus far, Arizona taxpayers have raised more than $430 million for
			 scholarships since 1998. In 2011 alone, nearly 75,000 taxpayers awarded more
			 than $47 million for 25,000 scholarships to Arizona children.
