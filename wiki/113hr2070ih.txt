It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, at wholesale or at retail in an area and during a period of an international crisis affecting the oil markets proclaimed under paragraph (2) , gasoline or any other petroleum distillate covered by a proclamation issued under paragraph (2) at a price that—
:(A) is unconscionably excessive; and
:(B) indicates the seller is taking unfair advantage of the circumstances related to an international crisis to increase prices unreasonably.

===(2) Energy emergency proclamation– ===



====(A) In general– ====

The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] may issue a proclamation of an international crisis affecting the oil markets and may designate any area within the jurisdiction of the United States, where the prohibition in paragraph (1) shall apply. The proclamation shall state the geographic area covered, the gasoline or other petroleum distillate covered, and the time period that such proclamation shall be in effect.

====(B) Duration– ====

The proclamation—
:(i) may not apply for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, but may be renewed for such consecutive periods, each not to exceed 30 days, as the President determines appropriate; and
:(ii) may include a period of time not to exceed 1 week preceding a reasonably foreseeable emergency.

===(3) Factors considered– ===

In determining whether a person has violated paragraph (1) , there shall be taken into account, among other factors—
:(A) whether the amount charged by such person for the applicable gasoline or other petroleum distillate at a particular location in an area covered by a proclamation issued under paragraph (2) during the period such proclamation is in effect—
::(i) grossly exceeds the average price at which the applicable gasoline or other petroleum distillate was offered for sale by that person during the 30 days prior to such proclamation;
::(ii) grossly exceeds the price at which the same or similar gasoline or other petroleum distillate was readily obtainable in the same area from other competing sellers during the same period;
::(iii) reasonably reflected additional costs, not within the control of that person, that were paid, incurred, or reasonably anticipated by that person, or reflected additional risks taken by that person to produce, distribute, obtain, or sell such product under the circumstances; and
::(iv) was substantially attributable to local, regional, national, or international market conditions; and
:(B) whether the quantity of gasoline or other petroleum distillate the person produced, distributed, or sold in an area covered by a proclamation issued under paragraph (2) during a 30-day period following the issuance of such proclamation increased over the quantity that that person produced, distributed, or sold during the 30 days prior to such proclamation, taking into account usual seasonal demand variations.

==(b) Definitions– ==

As used in this section—
:(1) the term wholesale , with respect to sales of gasoline or other petroleum distillates, means either truckload or smaller sales of gasoline or petroleum distillates where title transfers at a product terminal or a refinery, and dealer tank wagon sales of gasoline or petroleum distillates priced on a delivered basis to retail outlets; and
