=Sec. 2. Findings and sense of congress=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) America’s warriors offer a life of supreme devotion in service to their Nation, and through generations of war-fighting, their dedication has proven honorable, their sacrifice immeasurable, and their record of excellence undeniable.
:(2) No American goes to war alone—the burden of every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine is shared, in part, by all of his or her loved ones.

==(b) Sense of Congress– ==

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that—
:(1) so long as the United States sends men and women into battle, the United States will be faithful to care for them upon their return;
:(2) as the veteran answered the call of duty, so too, is the United States duty-bound to answer the call of the veteran;
:(3) the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] have the tools and ingenuity to provide continued excellent health care without increasing TRICARE payments from the veteran before fiscal year 2014; and
:(4) in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, “let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.” .
