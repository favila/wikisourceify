 To require the Transportation Security Administration to conform to existing Federal law and regulations regarding criminal investigator positions, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress makes the following findings:
:(1) Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law enforcement officers to qualify for premium pay as criminal investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on average at least 50 percent of their time investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.
:(2) According to the [[w:Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General|Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security]]( [[w:Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General|DHS IG]]), the [[w:Transportation Security Administration|Transportation Security Administration]]( [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]) does not ensure that its cadre of criminal investigators in the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Office of Inspection]]are meeting this requirement, even though they are considered law enforcement officers under [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]policy and receive premium pay.
:(3) Instead, [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]criminal investigators in the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Office of Inspection]]primarily monitor the results of criminal investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate administrative cases of [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]employee misconduct, and carry out inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which the [[w:Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General|DHS IG]]asserts could be performed by employees other than criminal investigators at a lower cost.
:(4) The premium pay and other benefits afforded to [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]criminal investigators in the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Office of Inspection]]who are incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer as much as $17,000,000 over 5 years if [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]fails to make any changes to the number of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection, according to the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|DHS]]IG.
:(5) This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for the cost of Law Enforcement Availability Pay, but not the costs of law enforcement training, statutory early retirement benefits, police vehicles, and weapons.
