=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “American Manufacturing Efficiency and Retraining Investment Collaboration Achievement Works Act” or “AMERICA Works Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Recent data show that United States manufacturing companies cannot fill as many as 600,000 skilled positions, even as unemployment numbers hover at historically high levels.
:(2) The unfilled positions are mainly in the skilled production category, and in occupations such as machinist, operator, craft worker, distributor, or technician.
:(3) In less than 20 years, an overall loss of expertise and management skill is expected to result from the gradual departure from the workplace of 77,200,000 workers.
:(4) Postsecondary success and workforce readiness can be achieved through attainment of a recognized postsecondary credential.
:(5) According to the January 2011 Computing Technology Industry Association report entitled “Employer Perceptions of Information Technology Training and Certification” , 64 percent of hiring information technology managers rate information technology certifications as having extremely high or high value in validating information technology skills and expertise. The value of those certifications is rated highest among senior information technology managers, such as Chief Information Officers, and managers of medium-size firms.
