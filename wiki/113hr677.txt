For the purposes of any clearing and execution requirements under section 2(h)
 and any applicable margin and capital requirements of section 4s(e)
 and for purposes of defining swap dealer
 or major swap participant
, and reporting requirements other than those set forth in clause (ii)
, the term swap
 does not include any agreement, contract, or transaction that—
(I)
would otherwise be included as a swap
 under subparagraph (A)
; and

(II)
is entered into by parties, neither of which is a ‘swap dealer’ that is an insured depository institution or a ‘major swap participant’ that is an insured depository institution, that report information or prepare financial statements on a consolidated basis, or for which a company affiliated with both parties reports information or prepares financial statements on a consolidated basis.


(ii)
Reporting
All agreements, contracts, or transactions described in clause (i)
 shall be reported to either a swap data repository, or, if there is no swap data repository that would accept such agreements, contracts, or transactions, to the [[|Commission]] pursuant to section 4r
, or to a swap data repository or to the [[|Commission]] pursuant to section 2(h)(5)
, within such time period as the [[|Commission]] may by rule or regulation prescribe. Nothing in this subparagraph shall prohibit the [[|Commission]] from establishing public reporting requirements for covered transactions between affiliates as described in sections 23A

 in a manner consistent with rules governing the treatment of such covered transactions pursuant to section 2(a)(13) of this Act
.

(iii)
Protection of insurance funds
Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to prevent the regulator of a Federal or State insurance fund or guaranty fund from exercising its other existing authority to protect the integrity of such a fund, except that such regulator shall not subject agreements, contracts, or transactions described in clause (i)
 to clearing and execution requirements under section 2 of this Act
, to any applicable margin and capital requirements of section 4s(e) of this Act
