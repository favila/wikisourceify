{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating March 25, 2013, as“National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day”.    Whereas the term“cerebral palsy”refers to any number of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and the muscle coordination necessary to maintain balance and posture;   Whereas cerebral palsy is caused by damage to 1 or more specific areas of the brain, which usually occurs during fetal development, before, during, or shortly after birth, or during infancy;   Whereas the majority of children who have cerebral palsy are born with the disorder, although cerebral palsy may remain undetected for months or years;   Whereas 75 percent of people with cerebral palsy also have 1 or more developmental disabilities, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, visual impairment, and blindness;   Whereas the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has released information indicating that cerebral palsy is increasingly prevalent and that approximately 1 in 278 children have cerebral palsy;   Whereas approximately 800,000 people in the United States are affected by cerebral palsy;   Whereas, although there is no cure for cerebral palsy, treatment often improves the capabilities of a child with cerebral palsy;   Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that breakthroughs in cerebral palsy research will be forthcoming;   Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting important research projects involving cerebral palsy; and   Whereas the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] is an institution that can raise awareness in the general public and the medical community about cerebral palsy: Now, therefore, be it
