DuBois, the Haitian-American author and political activist, who became one of the most prominent intellectual leaders of African-American society during the twentieth century;Whereas the close proximity of Haiti to the shores of the United States, in conjunction with the common bond of mutual values and commitment to democracy, ensures lasting comity of nations and continued trade and diplomatic relations;Whereas Haiti, the only republic to rise from a successful slave rebellion, inspires pride, solidarity, and self-reliance;Whereas the last Sunday of May is commemorated in Haiti as Mother’s Day;Whereas the 18th of May is Flag Day, the most celebrated holiday in Haiti, and is observed by people of Haitian descent throughout the world;Whereas in Miami, Florida, home to the largest Haitian-American population in the United States, there are numerous cultural events and celebrations planned during the month of May to honor Haitian heritage; andWhereas May is an appropriate month to establish a Haitian-American Heritage Month: Now, therefore, be it
