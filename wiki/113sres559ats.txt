{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating the week beginning on October 19, 2014, as “National Chemistry Week”.    Whereas chemistry is the science of basic units of matter and, consequently, plays a role in every aspect of human life;   Whereas chemistry has broad applications, including food science, water quality, energy, sustainability, medicine, and electronics;   Whereas the science of chemistry is vital to improving the quality of human life and plays an important role in addressing critical global challenges;   Whereas innovations in chemistry continue to spur economic growth and job creation and have applications for a range of industries;   Whereas National Chemistry Week is part of a broader vision to improve human life through chemistry and to advance the chemistry enterprise and the practitioners of such enterprise for the benefit of communities and the environment;   Whereas the purpose of National Chemistry Week is to reach the public with educational messages about chemistry in order to foster greater understanding and appreciation for the applications and benefits of chemistry;   Whereas National Chemistry Week strives to stimulate the interest of young people, including women and underrepresented groups, in enthusiastically studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and in pursuing science-related careers that lead to innovations and major scientific breakthroughs; and   Whereas students who participate in National Chemistry Week deserve recognition and support for their efforts: Now, therefore, be it
