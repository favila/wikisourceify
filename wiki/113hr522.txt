      Short title;
			 findings
			
        (a)
        Short
			 title
        This Act may be cited
			 as the 
            Balanced Budget Accountability
			 Act
          .
			
      
        (b)
        Findings
        
          
                [[United States Congress|Congress]]
            
			 finds the following:
				
          (1)
          The Federal debt exceeds $16 trillion,
			 continues to grow rapidly, and is larger than the size of the United States
			 economy.
				
        
          (2)
          The Federal budget
			 has shown an annual deficit in 45 of the last 50 years.
				
        
          (3)
          Deficits and the
			 Federal debt threaten to shatter confidence in the Nation’s economy, suppress
			 job creation and economic growth, and leave future generations of Americans
			 with a lower standard of living and fewer opportunities.
				
        
          (4)
          It is the duty of
			 Members of Congress to develop and implement policies, including balancing the
			 Federal budget, that encourage robust job creation and economic growth in the
			 United States.
				
        
          (5)
          Members of
			 Congress should be held accountable for failing to pass annual budgets that
			 result in a balanced budget.
