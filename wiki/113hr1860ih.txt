A decision by the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]], the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], or the [[w:United States Postal Service|Postal Service]]pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2552 paragraph (2)]shall not be subject to review.

====(e) Stays– ====


:(1) Upon the motion of the United States, the court shall stay the civil forfeiture proceeding if the court determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the Government to conduct a related criminal investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case.
:(2) Upon the motion of a claimant, the court shall stay the civil forfeiture proceeding with respect to that claimant if the court determines that—
::(A) the claimant is the subject of a related criminal investigation or case;
::(B) the claimant has standing to assert a claim in the civil forfeiture proceeding; and
::(C) continuation of the forfeiture proceeding will burden the right of the claimant against self-incrimination in the related investigation or case.
:(3) With respect to the impact of civil discovery described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2551 paragraphs (1)]and[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2551 (2)], the court may determine that a stay is unnecessary if a protective order limiting discovery would protect the interest of one party without unfairly limiting the ability of the opposing party to pursue the civil case. In no case, however, shall the court impose a protective order as an alternative to a stay if the effect of such protective order would be to allow one party to pursue discovery while the other party is substantially unable to do so.
:(4) In this subsection, the terms related criminal case and related criminal investigation mean an actual prosecution or investigation in progress at the time at which the request for the stay, or any subsequent motion to lift the stay is made. In determining whether a criminal case or investigation is“related”to a civil forfeiture proceeding, the court shall consider the degree of similarity between the parties, witnesses, facts, and circumstances involved in the two proceedings, without requiring an identity with respect to any one or more factors.
:(5) In requesting a stay under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2551 paragraph (1)], the Government may, in appropriate cases, submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect an ongoing criminal investigation or pending criminal trial.
:(6) Whenever a civil forfeiture proceeding is stayed pursuant to this subsection, the court shall enter any order necessary to preserve the value of the property or to protect the rights of lienholders or other persons with an interest in the property while the stay is in effect.
:(7) A determination by the court that the claimant has standing to request a stay pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2551 paragraph (2)]applies only to this subsection and does not preclude the Government from objecting to the standing of the claimant by dispositive motion or at the time of trial.

====(f) Venue– ====

In addition to the venue provided for in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1395  section 1395of title 28]or any other provision of law, in the case of property of a defendant charged with a violation that is the basis for forfeiture of the property under this section, a proceeding for forfeiture under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant owning such property is found or in the judicial district in which the criminal prosecution is brought.
