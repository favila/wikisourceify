===(3) Realty services– ===

The [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator]]shall develop policies and practices to implement cost-effective energy efficiency measures for the realty services provided by the [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator]]to Federal agencies (or other clients of the [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator]]), including periodic training of appropriate Federal employees and contractors on how to identify and evaluate those measures.

===(4) State and local assistance– ===

The [[w:General Services Administration|Administrator]], in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]], shall make available model leasing provisions and best practices developed under this subsection to State, county, and municipal governments to manage owned and leased building space in accordance with the goal of encouraging investment in all cost-effective energy efficiency measures. 

=Sec. 3. Separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures=

   Subtitle B of title IV of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17081 42 U.S.C. 17081 et seq.] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 

=Sec. 424. Separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures=



==(a) Definitions– ==

In this section:

===(1) High-performance energy efficiency measure– ===

The term high-performance energy efficiency measure means a technology, product, or practice that will result in substantial operational cost savings by reducing energy consumption and utility costs.

===(2) Separate spaces– ===

The term separate spaces means areas within a commercial building that are leased or otherwise occupied by a tenant or other occupant for a period of time pursuant to the terms of a written agreement.

==(b) Study– ==



===(1) In general– ===

Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]], acting through the [[w:|Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]], shall complete a study on the feasibility of—
:(A) significantly improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through the design and construction, by owners and tenants, of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures; and
:(B) encouraging owners and tenants to implement high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces.

===(2) Scope– ===

The study shall, at a minimum, include—
:(A) descriptions of—
::(i) high-performance energy efficiency measures that should be considered as part of the initial design and construction of separate spaces;
::(ii) processes that owners, tenants, architects, and engineers may replicate when designing and constructing separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures;
::(iii) standards and best practices to achieve appropriate energy intensities for lighting, plug loads, pipe loads, heating, cooling, cooking, laundry, and other systems to satisfy the needs of the commercial building tenant;
::(iv) return on investment and payback analyses of the incremental cost and projected energy savings of the proposed set of high-performance energy efficiency measures, including consideration of tax and other available incentives;
::(v) models and simulation methods that predict the quantity of energy used by separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures and that compare that predicted quantity to the quantity of energy used by separate spaces without high-performance energy efficiency measures but that otherwise comply with applicable building code requirements;
::(vi) measurement and verification platforms demonstrating actual energy use of high-performance energy efficiency measures installed in separate spaces, and whether such measures generate the savings intended in the initial design and construction of the separate spaces;
::(vii) best practices that encourage an integrated approach to designing and constructing separate spaces to perform at optimum energy efficiency in conjunction with the central systems of a commercial building; and
::(viii) any impact on employment resulting from the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures; and
:(B) case studies reporting economic and energy saving returns in the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures.

===(3) Public participation– ===

Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting public comments regarding effective methods, measures, and practices for the design and construction of separate spaces with high-performance energy efficiency measures.

===(4) Publication– ===

The [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary]]shall publish the study on the website of the Department of Energy. .

=Sec. 4. Tenant star program=

   Subtitle B of title IV of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/17081 42 U.S.C. 17081 et seq.] )(as amended by section 3 ) is amended by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote> 

=Sec. 425. Tenant star program=



==(a) Definitions– ==

In this section:

===(1) High-performance energy efficiency measure– ===

The term high-performance energy efficiency measure has the meaning given the term in section 424 .

===(2) Separate spaces– ===

The term separate spaces has the meaning given the term in section 424 .

==(b) Tenant Star– ==

The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]], in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]], shall develop a voluntary program within the Energy Star program established by  section 324A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6294a 42 U.S.C. 6294a]), which may be known as Tenant Star, to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces leased by tenants or otherwise occupied within commercial buildings.
