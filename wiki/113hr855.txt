			 general– ===

Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amendments made
			 by subsection (a) shall take effect 90 days after the date of the enactment of
			 this Act and shall apply to services furnished and other actions required on or
			 after such date.

==={{anchor|H5EE70485AF0F416B88A5F0F28CD76EC2}}(2) Rule for changes
			 requiring state legislation– ===

In the case of a State plan for
			 medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act which the
			 [[Wikipedia:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] determines requires State legislation
			 (other than legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet the
			 additional requirement imposed by the amendments made by subsection (a), the
			 State plan shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the requirements of
			 such title solely on the basis of its failure to meet this additional
			 requirement before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after
			 the close of the first regular session of the State legislature that begins
			 after the date of the enactment of this Act. For purposes of the previous
			 sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each
			 year of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the
			 State legislature.
