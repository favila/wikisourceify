{{Center|CONCURRENT RESOLUTION}}

 Recognizing the significance of the anniversary of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science and Technology Policy Fellowship program, and reaffirming the commitment to support the use of science in governmental decisionmaking through such program.    Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]hosted the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s (AAAS) first Congressional Science and Engineering Fellows 40 years ago in 1973;   Whereas the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering Fellowship program was the first to provide an opportunity for doctoral-level scientists and engineers to learn about the policymaking process while bolstering the technical expertise available to Members of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and staff;   Whereas Members of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]hold the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering Fellowship program in high regard for the substantial contributions that Fellows have made, serving in nearly 100 Congressional offices and committees, as well as the [[w:Library of Congress|Congressional Research Service]], [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]], and the former Office of Technology Assessment;   Whereas the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]is increasingly required to legislate on public policy issues of a scientific and technical nature and recognizes the need to develop additional in-house expertise in the areas of science and engineering;   Whereas nearly 1,200 individuals have held AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering Fellowships since 1973;   Whereas more than 1,400 individuals, across 20 Federal agencies and departments, have held the AAAS Executive Branch Science and Technology Policy Fellowships since its launch in 1980;   Whereas in total more than 2,600 Science and Technology Policy Fellows have had the opportunity to contribute knowledge and analytical skills in service to the United States Government;   Whereas over four decades AAAS has partnered with more than 60 professional societies and organizations to sponsor Science and Technology Policy Fellows;   Whereas the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows represent the full range of physical, biological, and social sciences, and all fields of engineering;   Whereas the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows bring to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]and the [[w:Executive Office of the President|Executive Branch]]new insights and ideas, extensive knowledge, and perspectives from a variety of disciplines;   Whereas the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows learn about the development and implementation of policy, stakeholder outreach, and communications through assignments that offer a wide array of responsibilities;   Whereas AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowships provide an opportunity for scientists and engineers to transition into careers in government service; and   Whereas many former AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows return to their disciplines and share knowledge with students and peers to encourage more scientists and engineers to participate in informing government processes: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]—
:(1) recognizes the significance of the anniversary of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science and Technology Policy Fellowship program;
:(2) acknowledges the value of 40 years of participation by the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Science and Technology Policy Fellows; and
:(3) reaffirms its commitment to support the use of science in governmental decisionmaking through the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Science and Technology Policy Fellowship program.
