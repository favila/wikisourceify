 To direct the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to carry out programs and activities to ensure that Federal science agencies and institutions of higher education receiving Federal research and development funding are fully engaging their entire talent pool, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title; findings=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“ STEM Opportunities Act of 2013 ”.

==(b) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Many reports over the past decade have found that it is critical to our Nation’s economic leadership and global competitiveness that we educate and train more scientists and engineers.
:(2) Research shows that women and minorities who are interested in STEM careers are lost at every educational transition, from high school on through full professorships.
:(3) According to data compiled by the National Science Foundation, women now earn about half of all science and engineering bachelor’s degrees, but major variations persist among fields. For example, women still receive only 20 percent of all bachelor’s degrees awarded in engineering and 10 percent in computer sciences. Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, jobs in computing occupations are expected to account for 62 percent of the projected annual growth of newly created STEM job openings from 2010 to 2020.
:(4) In 2007 underrepresented minority groups comprised 33.2 percent of the college-age population of the United States, but only 17.7 percent of undergraduate students earning bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields. The Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that, while freshmen from underrepresented minority groups express an interest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate degree at the same rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino students, 18.4 percent of African-American students, and 18.8 percent of Native American students studying in STEM fields complete their degree within 5 years, compared to an approximate 33 percent and 42 percent 5-year completion rate for White and Asian students, respectively.
:(5) Statistics are particularly alarming in specific STEM fields. For example, even though underrepresented minorities make up approximately 33 percent of the college-age population, according to an analysis of National Science Foundation data performed by the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, students from underrepresented minority groups earned only 13 percent of all engineering degrees in 2009.
:(6) Even in science and engineering fields with a higher representation of women, such as the social and behavioral sciences, women remain underrepresented among university faculty. According to data compiled by the National Science Foundation, for over 30 years women have made up over 30 percent of the doctorates awarded in social sciences and behavioral sciences and over 20 percent in the life sciences. Yet, at the top research institutions, only 15.4 percent of the full professors in the social and behavioral sciences and 14.8 percent in the life sciences are women.
:(7) Underrepresented minority groups currently make up about 29 percent of the United States population. However, only about 8 percent of tenure-track science and engineering faculty members at universities and 4-year colleges and less than 1 percent of tenure-track science and engineering faculty members at the top 100 research universities in the United States are from underrepresented minority groups.
:(8) By 2050 underrepresented minorities will comprise 52 percent of the college-age population of the United States. If the percentage of female students and students from underrepresented minority groups earning bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields does not significantly increase, the United States will face an acute shortfall in the overall number of students who earn degrees in STEM fields just as United States companies are increasingly seeking students with those skills. With this impending shortfall, the United States will almost certainly lose its competitive edge in the 21st century global economy.
:(9) According to a recent Association for Women in Science survey of over 4,000 scientists across the globe, 70 percent of whom were men, STEM researchers face significant challenges in work-life integration. Researchers in the United States were among the most likely to experience a conflict between work and their personal life at least weekly. One-third of researchers surveyed said that ensuring good work-life integration has negatively impacted their careers, and, of researchers intending to leave their current job within the next year, 9 percent indicated it was because they were unable to balance work and life demands.
:(10) Female students and students from underrepresented minority groups at institutions of higher education who see few others ‘‘like themselves’’ among faculty and student populations often do not experience the social integration that is necessary for success in all disciplines, including STEM.
:(11) A substantial body of evidence establishes that most people hold implicit biases. Decades of cognitive psychology research reveal that most people carry prejudices of which they are unaware but that nonetheless play a large role in evaluations of people and their work. Unintentional biases and outmoded institutional structures are hindering the access and advancement of women and minorities in science and engineering.
:(12) Workshops held to educate faculty about unintentional biases have demonstrated success in raising awareness of such biases.
:(13) In 2012 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity completed a report specifically designed to help NASA grant recipients identify why the dearth of women in STEM fields continues and to ensure that it is not due to discrimination. The report provides guidance to institutions of higher education on how to conduct meaningful self-evaluations of campus culture and policies. This report and its guidance are equally applicable to all institutions of higher education receiving significant Federal research funding.
:(14) The Federal Government provides over 60 percent of research funding at institutions of higher education and, through its grant-making policies, has had significant influence on institution of higher education policies, including policies related to institutional culture and structure. 

=Sec. 2. Purpose=
