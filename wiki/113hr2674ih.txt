===(a) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:

:(3) China also maintains market access barriers, which delay entry into China for legitimate products and, thus, create commercial opportunities for infringing products.
:(4) According to a report by the [[w:U.S. International Trade Commission|United States International Trade Commission]], Chinese piracy and counterfeiting of United States software and a wide range of other intellectual property cost American businesses an estimated $48 billion in 2009.
:(5) The report also concluded that 2.1 million jobs could be created in the United States if China complied with its current international obligations to protect and enforce intellectual property rights.
:(6) The most direct jobs impact would come in high-tech and other innovative industries.

:(4) The Internal Revenue Service reports that the average person spends more than 13 hours to fill out the tax forms.

==Title V— Northern Route Approval Act==



==Sec. 501. Short title==

This Act may be cited as the“ Northern Route Approval Act ”.

==Sec. 502. Findings==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) To maintain our Nation’s competitive edge and ensure an economy built to last, the United States must have fast, reliable, resilient, and environmentally sound means of moving energy. In a global economy, we will compete for the world’s investments based in significant part on the quality of our infrastructure. Investing in the Nation’s infrastructure provides immediate and long-term economic benefits for local communities and the Nation as a whole.
:(2) The delivery of oil from Canada, a close ally not only in proximity but in shared values and ideals, to domestic markets is in the national interest because of the need to lessen dependence upon insecure foreign sources.
:(3) The Keystone XL pipeline would provide both short-term and long-term employment opportunities and related labor income benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes.
:(4) The State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will have minimal environmental impacts.
:(5) The Department of State and other Federal agencies have over a long period of time conducted extensive studies and analysis of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, and—
::(A) the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]assessments found that the Keystone XL pipeline“is not likely to impact the amount of crude oil produced from the oil sands”and that“approval or denial of the proposed project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sands”;
::(B) the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]]found that incremental life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, with the upper end of this range representing twelve one-thousandths of one percent of the 6,702 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the United States in 2011; and
::(C) after extensive evaluation of potential impacts to land and water resources along the Keystone XL pipeline’s 875-mile proposed route, the Department of State found that“The analyses of potential impacts associated with construction and normal operation of the proposed Project suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with all laws and required conditions and measures).”.
:(6) The transportation of oil via pipeline is the safest and most economically and environmentally effective means of doing so, and—
::(A) transportation of oil via pipeline has a record of unmatched safety and environmental protection, and the Department of State found that“Spills associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment expected to be rare and relatively small”, and that“there is no evidence of increased corrosion or other pipeline threat due to viscosity”of diluted bitumen oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL pipeline; and
::(B) plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special conditions related to the design, construction, and operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the Department of State to find that the pipeline will have“a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline”.
:(7) The Keystone XL is in much the same position today as the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 prior to congressional action. Once again, the Federal regulatory process remains an insurmountable obstacle to a project that is likely to reduce oil imports from insecure foreign sources.

==Sec. 503. Keystone XL permit approval==

Notwithstanding  Executive Order No. 13337 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/301 3 U.S.C. 301 note]),  Executive Order No. 11423 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/301  3 U.S.C. 301note]),[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/301 section 301 of title 3, United States Code], and any other Executive order or provision of law, no Presidential permit shall be required for the pipeline described in the application filed on May 4, 2012, by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. to the Department of State for the Keystone XL pipeline, as supplemented to include the Nebraska reroute evaluated in the Final Evaluation Report issued by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality in January 2013 and approved by the Nebraska governor. The final environmental impact statement issued by the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]]on August 26, 2011, coupled with the Final Evaluation Report described in the previous sentence, shall be considered to satisfy all requirements of the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/4321 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.])and of the  National Historic Preservation Act ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/470 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.]).

:(2) the constitutionality of any provision of this Act, or any decision or action taken, made, granted, or issued, or deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under this Act; or
:(3) the adequacy of any environmental impact statement prepared under the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/4321 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.]), or of any analysis under any other Act, with respect to any action taken, made, granted, or issued, or deemed to be taken, made, granted, or issued under this Act.

<blockquote> 

==Sec. 610. Periodic review of rules==


:(a) Not later than 180 days after the enactment of the  Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013  , each agency shall publish in the Federal Register and place on its website a plan for the periodic review of rules issued by the agency which the head of the agency determines have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such determination shall be made without regard to whether the agency performed an analysis under section 604. The purpose of the review shall be to determine whether such rules should be continued without change, or should be amended or rescinded, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any adverse significant economic impacts or maximize any beneficial significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities. Such plan may be amended by the agency at any time by publishing the revision in the Federal Register and subsequently placing the amended plan on the agency’s website.
:(b) The plan shall provide for the review of all such agency rules existing on the date of the enactment of the  Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013  within 10 years of the date of publication of the plan in the Federal Register and for review of rules adopted after the date of enactment of the  Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013  within 10 years after the publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. If the head of the agency determines that completion of the review of existing rules is not feasible by the established date, the head of the agency shall so certify in a statement published in the Federal Register and may extend the review for not longer than 2 years after publication of notice of extension in the Federal Register. Such certification and notice shall be sent to the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]]and the Congress.
:(c) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding the results of its review pursuant to such plan to the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]], the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]], and, in the case of agencies other than independent regulatory agencies (as defined in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3502  section 3502(5)of title 44, United States Code]) to the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget]]. Such report shall include the identification of any rule with respect to which the head of the agency made a determination described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 paragraph (5)]or[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 (6) of subsection (d)]and a detailed explanation of the reasons for such determination.
:(d) In reviewing a rule pursuant to[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 subsections (a) through (c)], the agency shall amend or rescind the rule to minimize any adverse significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or disproportionate economic impact on a specific class of small entities, or maximize any beneficial significant economic impact of the rule on a substantial number of small entities to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes. In amending or rescinding the rule, the agency shall consider the following factors:
::(1) The continued need for the rule.
::(2) The nature of complaints received by the agency from small entities concerning the rule.
::(3) Comments by the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]].
::(4) The complexity of the rule.
::(5) The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts with other Federal rules and, unless the head of the agency determines it to be infeasible, State and local rules.
::(6) The contribution of the rule to the cumulative economic impact of all Federal rules on the class of small entities affected by the rule, unless the head of the agency determines that such calculations cannot be made and reports that determination in the annual report required under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 subsection (c)].
::(7) The length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.
:(e) The agency shall publish in the Federal Register and on its website a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to such plan. Such publication shall include a brief description of the rule, the reason why the agency determined that it has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (without regard to whether it had prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and request comments from the public, the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]], and the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman concerning the enforcement of the rule. .
