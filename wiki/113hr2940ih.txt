This Act may be cited as the“ Rebuilding American Manufacturing Act of 2013 ”.

==(b) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:

:(3) Approximately 1.2 million Americans are employed by the manufacturing industry.
:(4) The manufacturing industry provides stable jobs with sustainable wages to Americans in every State.
:(5) Manufacturing jobs provide, on average, wages that are above the national average and provide a gateway to the middle class.
:(6) The effective tax rate of domestic manufacturers ranges from 27 to 31 percent, depending on location and the size of equipment used in production.
:(7) Tax reform must make the United States more competitive, boost economic growth, and foster the creation of sustainable American jobs.
:(8) Tax reform should particularly focus on those companies that grow, build, and create goods in the United States.
:(9) The tax rate of domestic manufacturers should reflect the industry’s contributions of employment, growth, innovation, and competition in the United States.
