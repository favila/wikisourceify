:(ii) in lieu of using such payment or distribution for qualified higher education expenses, such payment or distribution is used for medical care (as defined in section 213(d) ) for such owner.

====(C) Coordination with medical expense deduction– ====

For purposes of determining the amount of the deduction under section 213 , any payment or distribution to which subparagraph (B) applies shall not be treated as an expense paid for medical care. .
