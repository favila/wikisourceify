{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Expressing support for designation of September 26, 2014, as “National Pediatric Bone Cancer Awareness Day” .Whereas September is “National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month” ;Whereas pediatric bone cancers comprise 5 percent of all pediatric cancers;Whereas 5 year survival rates from metastasized pediatric bone cancers are only about 10 percent;Whereas a separate day to raise awareness for pediatric bone cancer will help raise awareness of the disease in parents, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and better survival rates;Whereas increased awareness may also help promote funding into pediatric bone cancer research where treatments and survival rates have been virtually unchanged for a quarter century;Whereas children with bone cancer courageously face painful and disfiguring surgeries, grueling physical therapy, the side effects from the harshest of chemotherapies, lost time from school, and the social stigma among teens physical disabilities, scars, hair loss, weight loss, and absence from school;Whereas the parents, siblings, and families of children with bone cancer face unique difficulties, including separation of family for extended periods of time during treatment, difficulties in providing parental guidance to the children in the family who are not afflicted with cancer, financial strains over several years, and the emotional strain of watching a child suffer through treatment and often die a painful death after years of struggling;Whereas the Triumph Over Kid Cancer Foundation is working to raise research funds and awareness of pediatric bone cancer and now seeks this designation to continue the raising of public awareness of the extent and magnitude of the damages inflicted on families across the United States from pediatric bone cancer; andWhereas September 26, 2014, would be an appropriate date to designate as “National Pediatric Bone Cancer Awareness Day” to raise awareness for pediatric bone cancer: Now, therefore, be it
