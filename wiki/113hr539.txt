{{section|HA4E7EA0DC7B9487BA3AB119E13056787|2. Findings}}

        [[United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
(1)
Commissioners of the [[Federal Communications Commission|Federal Communications
			 Commission]] (in this section referred to as the Commission
), past
			 and present, have stated that, while they support the intent of section 552b of
			 title 5, United States Code
, the implementation of that section has hindered
			 the ability of the [[Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] to have a substantive exchange of ideas and hold
			 collective deliberations on issues pending before the [[Federal Communications Commission|Commission]].

(2)
The principal purpose of [[United States Congress|Congress]] in
			 creating a multimember agency is to obtain the benefits of collegial
			 decisionmaking by the members of the agency, who bring to the decisionmaking
			 process different philosophical perspectives, experiences, and areas of
			 expertise.

(3)
Commissioners have relied primarily on an
			 inefficient combination of written messages, communications among staff, and a
			 series of meetings restricted to 2 Commissioners at each such meeting to
			 discuss complex telecommunications matters pending before the
			 [[Federal Communications Commission|Commission]].

(4)
Extensive use of such methods of
			 communication has harmed collegiality and cooperation at the [[Federal Communications Commission|Commission]].

(5)
Numerous regulatory matters have been
			 pending before the [[Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] for years, and continued inaction on these issues
			 has the potential to hinder innovation and private investment in the domestic
			 communications industry.

(6)
The [[Federal Communications Commission|Commission]] must be able to work more
			 collaboratively and efficiently than in the past to meet the current challenge
			 of expanding broadband Internet access to the extent necessary to serve the
			 business, educational, health, and cultural needs of all people in the United
			 States.
