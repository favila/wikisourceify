=={{anchor|id52E7F72DD074462A83C05AB355D46060}}(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) According to the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] and the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] , at least 30,137 members of the Armed Forces and veterans have committed suicide since the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] began closely tracking these incidents in 2009.
:(2) In 2012 alone, approximately 349 members of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserve, committed suicide, which is more than the total number of members who died in combat operations in 2012. This number does not include the more than 6,000 veterans who committed suicide in 2012.
:(3) During a March 21, 2013, hearing of the [[w:United States House Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives]] , Jacqueline Garrick, acting director of the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Defense Suicide Prevention Office of the Department of Defense]] (DPSO), stated that“<nowiki>[l]ess than half [of the suicide victims] had deployed, and few were involved in combat</nowiki>”. This statement is consistent with current research, which has shown other risk factors, such as relationships, legal or financial issues and alcohol or drug usage play a larger role than a member's deployment history. Garrick also told the Committee that many of these suicidal victims did not communicate their intent, nor did they have known behavioral health histories.
