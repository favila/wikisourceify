If the court decides that the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] was not authorized to deny the application or to suspend or revoke the license or to assess the civil penalty, the court shall order the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] to take such action as may be necessary to comply with the judgment of the court..
