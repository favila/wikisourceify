			 proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall
			 be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified
			 by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States:
 —

{{section|H71A246E8521A4584A6F4C98FBEDF327E|1.}}

				elections belongs only to natural persons as citizens of the United States, so

				this Article.

{{section|H194C55E370174217B208CF5D58CAAB88|2.}}
Nothing in this Constitution shall be
				construed to restrict the power of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the States to protect the
				integrity and fairness of the electoral process, limit the corrupting influence
				of private wealth in public elections, and guarantee the dependence of elected
				officials on the people alone by taking actions which may include the
				establishment of systems of public financing for elections, the imposition of
				requirements to ensure the disclosure of contributions and expenditures made to
				influence the outcome of a public election by candidates, individuals, and
				associations of individuals, and the imposition of content neutral limitations
				on all such contributions and expenditures.

{{section|HECCB2E18524F4AA6AB49731BA1115D38|3.}}
Nothing in this Article shall be construed
				to alter the freedom of the press.
