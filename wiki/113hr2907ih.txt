[[w:Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Mr. Wilson of South Carolina]] introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Armed Services|Committee on Armed Services]] }}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend title 10, United States Code, to ensure that members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces who have served on active duty or performed active service since September 11, 2001, in support of a contingency operation or in other emergency situations receive credit for such service in determining eligibility for early receipt of non-regular service retired pay, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “National Guardsmen and Reservists Parity for Patriots Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Since September 11, 2001, members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces have been sent into harm's way and fought alongside members of the regular components of the Armed Forces.
:(2) Between September 11, 2001, and January 28, 2008, more than 600,000 members of the reserve components have been mobilized in support of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and for other contingency operations.
:(3) More than 142,000 members of the reserve components have been mobilized more than once during this same period.
:(4) In recognition of the service performed by these members of the reserve components, Congress enacted section 647 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008([[Public Law 110-181|Public Law 110–181]] ,122 Stat. 160), which amended [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12731 section 12731of title 10, United States Code] , to offer an earlier retirement benefit for members of the reserve components who are mobilized in support of contingency operations.
:(5) However, the amendment made by section 647 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008only considers service performed after the date of the enactment of such Act, January 28, 2008, and this effective date fails to recognize the service and sacrifice made by members of the reserve components between September 11, 2001, and January 28, 2008.

=Sec. 3. Consideration of service since September 11, 2001, in determining early eligibility for receipt of non-regular service retired pay=

 [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12731 Section 12731(f)(2)(A)of title 10, United States Code] , as added by section 647 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008([[Public Law 110-181|Public Law 110–181]] ,122 Stat. 160), is amended—
:(1) by striking “January 28, 2008” and inserting “September 11, 2001” ; and
:(2) by striking “in any fiscal year after such date” and inserting “such duty or service after that date during fiscal year 2002 and any subsequent fiscal year” .
