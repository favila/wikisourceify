{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Directing the Clerk of the House of Representatives to place a real time display of the United States gross national debt in the House Chamber.    Whereas Members of Congress should keep the gross national debt in mind when debating legislation that would affect the nation’s fiscal situation;   Whereas by displaying our national debt in real time in the House Chamber, Members of Congress can better debate our nation’s fiscal situation;   Whereas from 1791 to 1984, the total accumulated Federal deficit was $1.5 trillion;   Whereas the projected Federal debt in 2013 is $16.8 trillion;   Whereas Members of Congress should be constantly reminded that the gross national debt must be reduced;   Whereas a real time display of the gross national debt will inform every Member of Congress of the need to take action to reduce the debt;   Whereas the exact amount of the gross national debt will be known and updated with every action affecting the amount of debt; and   Whereas display of the national debt in the chamber of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] will be a sign that representatives are committed to reducing the national debt: Now, therefore, be it
