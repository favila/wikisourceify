{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and ideals of National Youth HIV & AIDS Awareness Day.    Whereas more than 30 years into the epidemic, the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) estimates that in the United States more than 1,100,000 people are living with HIV, and every year approximately 50,000 people acquire HIV;   Whereas 1 in 4 new HIV infections occurs among young people between the ages of 13 and 24, accounting for 1,000 new cases every month;   Whereas 60 percent of HIV positive youth do not know they carry the HIV virus;   Whereas there are approximately 76,400 young people living with HIV;   Whereas African-American youth bear a disproportionate burden of the epidemic, representing 60 percent of new infections in young people;   Whereas new HIV infections among 13- to 29-year-old African-American men who have sex with men (MSM) increased 48 percent from 2006 through 2009;   Whereas the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Division of Adolescent and School Health]] (DASH), is the only Federal program supporting HIV prevention for adolescents in schools;   Whereas the Nation’s largest Federal program dedicated to providing care and treatment for people living with HIV was named after Ryan White, a teenager from Indiana who helped educate a Nation about HIV and AIDS in the 1980s;   Whereas the Ryan White Part D Program is one of the national efforts to link HIV positive youth to medical care and support services;   Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes many provisions that benefit young people and help achieve the goal of an AIDS-free generation, including funding for sex education to help ensure that every young person in the United States is educated about HIV/AIDS, a prohibition against denying people living with HIV access to health care, HIV testing for women without a co-pay, and expanded access to Medicaid which will help more HIV-positive youth receive care; and   Whereas April 10 of each year is now recognized as National Youth HIV & AIDS Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it
