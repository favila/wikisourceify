===={{anchor|H81534AC4046E46B7A92DB9319EF45F32}}(a) Commission– ====


:(1) 
::(A) In a case in which the

===={{anchor|H274459BAFD4D4EAFAC5294FD95466924}}(b) Court– ====

Whenever
				it appears that any fiduciary, in the opinion of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]], is not properly
				executing or has not properly executed the duties of the trust of such
				fiduciary or has collected or paid, or is attempting to collect or pay, fees,
				commissions, or allowances that are inequitable or in excess of those allowed
				by law for the duties performed or expenses incurred, or has failed to make
				such payments as may be necessary for the benefit of the ward or the dependents

				attorney, in the court which has appointed such fiduciary, or in any court

				authorized attorney in any court as an interested party in any litigation
				instituted by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] or otherwise, directly affecting money paid to such

				payment of benefits– ====

All or any part of any benefits the payment
				of which is suspended or withheld under this section may, in the discretion of
				the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]], be paid temporarily to the person having custody and control of
				the incompetent or minor beneficiary, to be used solely for the benefit of such
				beneficiary, or, in the case of an incompetent veteran, may be apportioned to
				the dependent or dependents, if any, of such veteran. Any part not so paid and
				any funds of a mentally incompetent or insane veteran not paid to the chief
				officer of the institution in which such veteran is a patient nor apportioned
				to the veteran's dependent or dependents may be ordered held in the Treasury to
				the credit of such beneficiary. All funds so held shall be disbursed under the
				order and in the discretion of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] for the benefit of such
				beneficiary or the beneficiary's dependents. Any balance remaining in such fund
				to the credit of any beneficiary may be paid to the beneficiary if the
				beneficiary recovers and is found competent, or if a minor, attains majority,
				or otherwise to the beneficiary's fiduciary, or, in the event of the
				beneficiary's death, to the beneficiary's personal representative, except as
				otherwise provided by law; however, payment will not be made to the

				settlement, and in the order named: The surviving spouse, the children (without
				regard to age or marital status) in equal parts, and the dependent parents of
				such veteran, in equal parts. If any balance remains, such balance shall be
				deposited to the credit of the applicable current appropriation; except that
				there may be paid only so much of such balance as may be necessary to reimburse
				a person (other than a political subdivision of the United States) who bore the
				expenses of last sickness or burial of the veteran for such expenses. No
				payment shall be made under the two preceding sentences of this subsection
				unless claim therefor is filed with the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]] within five years after the
				death of the veteran, except that, if any person so entitled under said two
				sentences is under legal disability at the time of death of the veteran, such
				five-year period of limitation shall run from the termination or removal of the
				legal disability.

				would escheat to the State, shall escheat to the United States and shall be
				returned by such fiduciary, or by the personal representative of the deceased
				beneficiary, less legal expenses of any administration necessary to determine
