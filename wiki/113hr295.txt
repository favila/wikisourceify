              (D)
              Notification
              The 
                [[United States Department of the Treasury|Secretary]]
             shall determine whether or
				not to grant the disclosure request described in subparagraph (A) and notify
				the petitioning law enforcement agency within 30 days of receiving the request.
				This determination shall be expedited in instances where the crimes of murder,
				murder for hire, or arson are involved as certified by the requesting agency’s
				head.
