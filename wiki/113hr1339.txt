To amend the Public Health Service Act to increase the number of permanent faculty in palliative care at accredited allopathic and osteopathic medical schools, nursing schools, and other programs, to promote education in palliative care and hospice, and to support the development of faculty careers in academic palliative medicine.

={{anchor|H0BF58148F5484BF299B668B16B77AF5C}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act”.

={{anchor|H2E4A6FB98EF14D23A36BFDC79FD37CC6}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Health care providers need better education about pain management and palliative care. Students graduating from medical school have very little, if any, training in the core precepts of pain and symptom management, advance care planning, communication skills, and care coordination for patients with serious, life-threatening, or terminal illness.
:(2) Palliative care is interdisciplinary, patient- and family-centered health care for people with serious illnesses. This type of care is focused on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious illness, whatever the diagnosis. The goal of palliative care is to relieve suffering and improve quality of life for both patients and their families. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other specialists who work with a patient’s other health care providers to provide an extra layer of support, including assistance with difficult medical decisionmaking and coordination of care among specialists. Palliative care is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness, and can be provided together with curative treatment. Palliative care is not dependent on a life-limiting prognosis and may actually help an individual recover from illness by relieving symptoms, such as pain, anxiety, or loss of appetite, while undergoing sometimes difficult medical treatments or procedures, such as surgery or chemotherapy. There were 1,623 hospitals with palliative care programs in 2012.
:(3) Hospice is palliative care for patients in their last year of life. Considered the model for quality compassionate care for individuals facing a life-limiting illness, hospice provides expert medical care, pain management, and emotional and spiritual support expressly tailored to the patient’s needs and wishes. In most cases, care is provided in the patient’s home but may also be provided in freestanding hospice centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other long-term care facilities. In 2011, an estimated 1,650,000 patients received services from hospice, and nearly 45 percent of all deaths in the United States occurred under the care of a hospice program. Hospice is a covered benefit under the Medicare program. There were 3,630 Medicare-certified hospices serving more than 1,200,000 beneficiaries in 2011.
:(4) A 2005 study at Michigan State University found that the formal training of United States doctors in palliative care is“grossly inadequate”. When the American Society of Clinical Oncology surveyed their members, 65 percent said they had received inadequate education in controlling symptoms associated with cancer, and 81 percent felt they had inadequate mentoring in discussing a poor prognosis with their patients and families. Training in pediatric palliative care is also seriously lacking according to physicians, residents, and medical students responding to a survey presented at a meeting of American Federation for Medical Research.
:(5) The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) provided formal subspecialty status for hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) in 2006, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recognized hospice and palliative medicine as a medical subspecialty in October of 2008.
:(6) As of February 2013, there were a total of 89 hospice and palliative medicine training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. For the 2012–2013 academic year, these programs were training 206 physicians in hospice and palliative medicine. Some programs include an additional track in research, geriatrics, or public health.
:(7) There is a large gap between those practicing in the palliative medicine field and the number of physicians needed. A mid-range estimate by the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine’s Workforce Task Force calls for 6,000 or more full time equivalents to serve current needs in hospice and palliative care programs. At maximum capacity, the current system would produce roughly 4,600 new hospice and palliative medicine certified physicians over the next 20 years, during which time some 70,000,000 new Medicare beneficiaries will enter the Medicare program. At the same time, there is expected to be increasing acceptance of the hospice and palliative approach to care among the general population and health care providers.
