:(a) The [[Wikipedia:United States House of Representatives|House]] finds
			 that—
::(1) every bipartisan
			 commission has recommended—and the majority of Americans agree—that we should
			 take a balanced, bipartisan approach to reducing the deficit that addresses
			 both revenue and spending; and
::(2) sequestration is a
			 meat-ax approach to deficit reduction that imposes deep and mindless cuts,
			 regardless of their impact on vital services and investments.
:(b) It is the sense of
			 the [[Wikipedia:United States House of Representatives|House]] that the [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] should replace the entire 10-year sequester
			 established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 with a balanced approach that
			 would increase revenues without increasing the tax burden on middle-income
			 Americans, and decrease long-term spending while maintaining the Medicare
			 guarantee, protecting Social Security and a strong social safety net, and
			 making strategic investments in education, science, research, and critical
			 infrastructure necessary to compete in the global economy.
