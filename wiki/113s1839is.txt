{{Center|A BILL}}

 To make certain luggage and travel articles eligible for duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ GSP Update for Production Diversification and Trade Enhancement Act ”or“ GSP UPDATE Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The Generalized System of Preferences under  title V of the Trade Act of 1974 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/2461 19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq].)was enacted to promote economic development in developing and least-developed countries.
:(2) Many articles referred to as luggage or travel articles and classified under chapter 42 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States may not be designated as eligible articles for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences.
:(3) Global trade and manufacturing dynamics have changed since the enactment of the Generalized System of Preferences in 1974, and many luggage and travel articles may no longer be import-sensitive to industries in the United States.
:(4) By removing certain luggage and travel articles from the list of articles excluded from eligibility under the Generalized System of Preferences, [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] is not changing rates in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, but instead is allowing those articles access to the annual review process under the Generalized System of Preferences, which relies on investigations and recommendations from the independent [[w:U.S. International Trade Commission|United States International Trade Commission]] , among other agencies of the United States Government.
:(5) As of February 2012, 73 of the 132 countries designated as beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences export articles classified under heading 4202 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to the United States. Twenty of those countries have been designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences.
:(6) As of February 2012, the People's Republic of China has a nearly 80 percent share of the market for certain luggage and travel articles being imported into the United States. This dominance leaves little room for competition from smaller developing countries. For example, countries designated as beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences account for only 5 percent of imports of those articles into the United States.
:(7) The provision of duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences for certain luggage and travel articles imported into the United States may result in a shift in the production of those articles from China to countries designated as beneficiary developing countries or least-developed beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences. 

=Sec. 3. Eligibility of certain luggage and travel articles for duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences=

   Section 503(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/2463 19 U.S.C. 2463(b)] )is amended—
:(1) in paragraph (1) —
::(A) in subparagraph (A) , by striking“paragraph (4)”and inserting“  paragraphs (4) and (5)  ”; and
::(B) in subparagraph (E) , by striking“Footwear”and inserting“Except as provided in paragraph (5) , footwear”; and
:(2) by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>
