        [[United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following
			 findings:
(1)
The current and
			 future health care needs of veterans residing in the Far South Texas area are
			 not being fully met by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]].

(2)
The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of
			 Veterans Affairs]] estimates that more than 117,000 veterans reside in Far South
			 Texas.

(3)
In its Capital
			 Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services study, the [[|Department of Veterans
			 Affairs]] found that fewer than 3 percent of its enrollees in the Valley-Coastal
			 Bend Market of Veterans Integrated Service Network 17 reside within its acute
			 hospital access standards.

(4)
Travel times for
			 veterans from the market referred to in paragraph (3)
 can exceed six hours from
			 their residences to the nearest [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] hospital for
			 acute inpatient health care.

(5)
Even with the
			 significant travel times, veterans from Far South Texas demonstrate a high
			 demand for health care services from the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]].

(6)
Current
			 deployments involving members of the Texas National Guard and other members of
			 the reserve components of the Armed Forces who reside in Texas will continue to
			 increase demand for medical services provided by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans
			 Affairs]].
