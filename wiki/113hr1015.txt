{{Center|A BILL}}

To require the Commissioner of Social Security to revise the medical and evaluation criteria for determining disability in a person diagnosed with Huntington’s Disease and to waive the 24-month waiting period for Medicare eligibility for individuals disabled by Huntington’s Disease.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Huntington’s Disease Parity Act of 2013”.

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]makes the following findings:
: Huntington’s Disease is a progressive degenerative neurological disease that causes total physical and mental deterioration. In the United States, approximately 30,000 individuals are affected by Huntington’s Disease, along with another 200,000 individuals who are genetically “at risk ”. There is no effective treatment in terms of halting or slowing the progression of the disease.: Clinical indicators of Huntington’s Disease include—:: loss of ability to control bodily movements;:: loss of ability to think or act quickly, inability to learn new material, and loss of memory; and:: behavioral or psychological problems, including personality changes, irritability, mood swings, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, inability to concentrate, decreased motivation, and severe depression.: Adult-onset Huntington’s Disease typically results in the development of symptoms in individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. Late-onset Huntington’s Disease is characterized by development of symptoms after 50 years of age and is usually associated with a milder course of the disease. Juvenile Huntington’s Disease affects individuals who have yet to attain 19 years of age and progresses at a more rapid rate.: Because of the incapacitating nature of Huntington’s Disease, individuals living with this illness, including those in the early stages of the disease, are unable to retain employment. As a result, many such individuals rely solely on Social Security Disability Insurance.: Despite significant advances in medicine and a greater understanding of Huntington's Disease, the [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Social Security Administration ]]has not comprehensively revised its rules for the medical evaluation of neurological disabilities since 1985. The designation of this disease by the [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Social Security Administration ]]as “Huntington’s Chorea ”is both outdated and medically inaccurate, as this term fails to recognize the behavioral and cognitive impact of Huntington's Disease, while also providing an incomplete characterization of the full spectrum of Huntington’s Disease for purposes of Social Security Disability Insurance and the Medicare program.: After qualifying for Social Security Disability Insurance, individuals with Huntington’s Disease must wait another 24 months before receiving benefits under the Medicare program, despite the fact that such individuals often become incapacitated before reaching the age-eligibility requirement under the Medicare program of 65 years of age.: In 2000, the [[Wikipedia:Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services ]]waived the 24-month waiting period requirement for people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( “ALS ”), a degenerative neurological condition that is similar to Huntington’s Disease.: In light of the outdated Social Security Disability Insurance guidelines for Huntington’s Disease and the significant cognitive, behavioral, and physical incapacitation faced by individuals with this disease, there is an urgent need for a revision of the medical and evaluation criteria used by the [[Wikipedia:Social Security Administration|Social Security Administration ]]in determining whether such individuals are disabled, as well as removal of the 24-month waiting period for coverage under the Medicare program for such individuals, similar to the existing exemption for individuals who have been diagnosed with ALS.
