[[w:|Mr. Moran]](for himself,

{{Center|A BILL}}

 To reauthorize and modify the pilot program of the Department of Veterans Affairs under which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs provides health services to veterans through qualifying non-Department of Veterans Affairs health care providers, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Veterans Health Care Access Received Closer to Home Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) veterans who are authorized by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veterans Affairs]]to receive health care in the community must not lose the high quality, safety, care coordination, and other veteran-centric elements that the health care system of the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]provides;
:(2) many veterans receive health care from both the Department and community providers but the lack of care coordination among the Department and community providers when veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite health care resources;
:(3) veteran-centric care coordination is associated with improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the best care for veterans; and
:(4) if the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]purchases care for veterans from the private sector, such care must be secured in a cost-effective manner, in a way that complements the larger health care system of the Department by using industry standards for care and costs. 

=Sec. 3. Reauthorization and modification of pilot program of enhanced contract care authority for health care needs of veterans=

   Section 403 of the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 ([[Public Law 110-387|Public Law 110–387]] ;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1703  38 U.S.C. 1703note])is amended—
:(1) in subsection (a) —
::(A) in paragraph (2) , by striking“120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act”and inserting“90 days after the date of the enactment of the  Veterans Health Care Access Received Closer to Home Act of 2014   ”; and
::(B) by amending paragraph (4) to read as follows:

<blockquote> 

====(4) Program locations– ====

The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]shall carry out the pilot program at locations in the following Veterans Integrated Service Networks (and such other locations as the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]considers appropriate):
:(A) Veterans Integrated Service Network 1.
:(B) Veterans Integrated Service Network 6.
:(C) Veterans Integrated Service Network 15.
:(D) Veterans Integrated Service Network 18.
:(E) Veterans Integrated Service Network 19. ; 
</blockquote>

:(2) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

<blockquote> 

===(b) Covered veterans– ===

For purposes of the pilot program under this section, a covered veteran is any rural or highly rural veteran who—
:(1) is—
::(A) enrolled in the system of patient enrollment established under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1705  section 1705(a)of title 38, United States Code];
::(B) eligible for health care under the laws administered by the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]and enrolls in such system of patient enrollment not later than 30 days after the veteran begins receiving covered health services under the pilot program; or
::(C) eligible for health care under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1710 section 1710(e)(3) of such title]; and
:(2) resides in a location that is—
::(A) more than 60 minutes driving distance from the nearest [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]]health care facility providing primary care services, if the veteran is seeking such services;
::(B) more than 120 minutes driving distance from the nearest [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]]health care facility providing acute hospital care, if the veteran is seeking such care; or
::(C) more than 240 minutes driving distance from the nearest [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department]]health care facility providing tertiary care, if the veteran is seeking such care. ; 
</blockquote>

:(3) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (j) ;
:(4) by inserting after subsection (g) the following new subsections:

<blockquote> 

===(h) Appointments– ===

In carrying out the pilot program under this section, the [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]shall ensure that medical appointments for veterans occur during the 30-day period beginning on the date that is 15 days after the date on which the appointment is requested. 

===(i) Outreach– ===

The [[w:United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Secretary]]shall ensure that a veteran eligible for the pilot program under this section is informed of such program. ; and 
</blockquote>
