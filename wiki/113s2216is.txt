::(1) not later than 10 business days after the date on which the agency determines that the sanction may be imposed on the business, provide notice to the business that, if the business is a small business, the small business may be subject to a sanction at the end of the grace period described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (3)];
::(2) delay any further action relating to the sanction until the end of the 15-calendar day period beginning on the date on which the agency provides notice under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (1)];
::(3) for a small business—
:::(A) delay any further action relating to the sanction until not earlier than the end of the 6-month period beginning on the date on which the agency provides notice under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (1)]; and
:::(B) upon application by the small business demonstrating reasonable efforts made in good faith to remedy the violation or other conduct giving rise to the sanction, extending the period under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subparagraph (A)]by 3 months;
::(4) after the end of the period described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (3)], redetermine whether, as of the day after the end of the period, the small business would still be subject to the sanction; and
::(5) if the agency determines under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 paragraph (4)]that the small business would not be subject to the sanction, waive the sanction. 
:(e) If an agency provides notice described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)(1)]to a business on or after the date that is 11 business days after the date on which the agency determines that a sanction may be imposed on the business—
::(1) if the agency determines that the same sanction may have been imposed on the business 10 business days before the date of the notice, the agency shall take further action in accordance with[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)]; and
::(2) if the agency determines that the same sanction could not have been imposed on the business 10 business days before the date of the notice, the agency shall waive the sanction and take no further action relating to imposition of the sanction.

:(h) Any sanction imposed by an agency on a small business for any violation of a rule or pursuant to an adjudication, absent proof of written notice of the sanction and the date on which the agency determined that a sanction may be imposed, or in violation of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)(3)], shall have no force or effect. 
:(i) Each Federal agency shall submit to the Ombudsman an annual report on the implementation of[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/558 subsection (d)], including a discussion of the deferral of action relating to and waiver of sanctions on small businesses.
