3. Sense of the House of Representatives regarding tax reform


It is the sense of the [[Wikipedia:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives ]]that—

: [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]should enact tax reform that repeals unfair and unnecessary tax loopholes and expenditures, simplifies the system for millions of taxpayers and businesses, and makes sure that the wealthiest taxpayers pay a fair share; and

: this Act is an interim step that can be done quickly and serve as a floor on taxes for the highest-income taxpayers, cut the deficit by billions of dollars a year, and help encourage more fundamental reform of the tax system.
