:(3) Lenders and consumers receive benefits such as quicker approval, lower interest rates, protection of privacy, and stronger anti-fraud protections from automatic underwriting utilizing existing databases.
:(4) Eleven States (Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and Virginia) passed enabling legislation or rules enabling consumers who request that third parties using consumer report information for purposes of eligibility determination have efficient access to this information from the State’s unemployment insurance database.
:(5)  Fair Credit Reporting Actrequirements already require third parties using consumer report information for purposes of eligibility determination to obtain and maintain consent agreements.

=Sec. 3. Prohibition on requirement for onward transfer of consent agreements=
