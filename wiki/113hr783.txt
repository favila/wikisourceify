{{Center|A BILL}}

To enhance diplomacy with Iran to peacefully prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Prevent Iran from Acquiring Nuclear Weapons and Stop War Through Diplomacy Act”.

2. Findings


[[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:
: In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech on December 10, 2009, President Obama said, “I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation. But I also know that sanctions without outreach—and condemnation without discussion—can carry forward a crippling status quo. No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door. ”.: President Obama stated on November 14, 2012, that, “With respect to Iran, I very much want to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem. I was very clear before the campaign, I was clear during the campaign and I’m now clear after the campaign—we’re not going to let Iran get a nuclear weapon. But I think there is still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically. We’ve imposed the toughest sanctions in history. It is having an impact on Iran’s economy. There should be a way in which they can enjoy peaceful nuclear power while still meeting their international obligations and providing clear assurances to the international community that they’re not pursuing a nuclear weapon. ”.: While the United States has engaged in direct negotiations with Iran without preconditions under the Obama Administration, official representatives of the United States and official representatives of Iran have held only two direct, bilateral meetings in over 30 years, both of which occurred in October 2009, one on the sidelines of the United Nations Security Council negotiations in Geneva, and one on the sidelines of negotiations brokered by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (referred to in this Act as the “IAEA ”) in Vienna.: Resolving all of the outstanding issues between the United States and Iran cannot be achieved instantaneously and will require a robust, sustained diplomatic effort involving multilateral and bilateral negotiations.: Under the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of State|Department of State’s ]]current “no contact ”policy, officers and employees of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of State|Department of State ]]are not permitted to make any direct contact with official representatives of the Government of Iran without express prior authorization from the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of State|Secretary of State ]].: On September 20, 2011, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen called for establishing direct communications with Iran, stating, “I’m talking about any channel that’s open. We’ve not had a direct link of communication with Iran since 1979. And I think that has planted many seeds for miscalculation. When you miscalculate, you can escalate and misunderstand. ”.: While the International Atomic Energy Agency continues to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran and has inspectors and monitoring devices located at Iranian nuclear facilities, the agency has expressed concerns regarding Iran’s past and ongoing nuclear work that can only be resolved through increased transparency, more robust safeguards, and a more vigorous inspections regime.: On October 3, 2012, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated, “The results of an American or Israeli military strike on Iran could, in my view, prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations in that part of the world. ”, adding that “[S]uch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable. They would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert. ”.
