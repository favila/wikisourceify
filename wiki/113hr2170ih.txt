</blockquote>


==(b) Findings and purposes– ==

   Subpart 9 of part D of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/7259 20 U.S.C. 7259 et seq.])is further amended by inserting after section 5491 the following:

<blockquote> 

==Sec. 5491A. Findings; purposes==



===(a) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) According to the National Research Council in 2007, a pervasive lack of knowledge about foreign cultures and foreign languages in this country threatens the security of the United States as well as its ability to compete in the global marketplace and produce an informed citizenry.
:(2) According to the National Research Council in 2007, early language learning in elementary and secondary school is key to establishing a pipeline of students who can eventually reach a high enough level of proficiency in foreign language and culture to meet national needs.
:(3) According to the Committee for Economic Development in 2006, current efforts to develop language skills and knowledge of world regions at an early age are clearly inadequate to prepare high school graduates with the skills necessary for productivity and citizenship in an integrated global economy.
:(4) Research demonstrates that success lies not only in the number of years of learning but also in having carefully sequenced and articulated programs of language learning across a child’s school experience, requiring bridging the gaps between levels in foreign language education.

===(b) Purposes– ===

The purposes of this subpart are—
:(1) to provide grants for model programs that address the needs for developing, strengthening, and expanding the teaching and learning of foreign languages and foreign cultures in the elementary and secondary schools of the United States; and
:(2) to widely disseminate information on successful programs and practices. . 
</blockquote>
