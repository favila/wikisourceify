=Sec. 2. Congressional findings=



==(a) Findings Relating to Federal Income Tax– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the Federal income tax—
:(1) retards economic growth and has reduced the standard of living of the American public;
:(2) impedes the international competitiveness of United States industry;
:(3) reduces savings and investment in the United States by taxing income multiple times;
:(4) slows the capital formation necessary for real wages to steadily increase;
:(5) lowers productivity;
:(6) imposes unacceptable and unnecessary administrative and compliance costs on individual and business taxpayers;
:(7) is unfair and inequitable;
:(8) unnecessarily intrudes upon the privacy and civil rights of United States citizens;
:(9) hides the true cost of government by embedding taxes in the costs of everything Americans buy;
:(10) is not being complied with at satisfactory levels and therefore raises the tax burden on law abiding citizens; and
:(11) impedes upward social mobility.

==(b) Findings Relating to Federal Payroll Taxes– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds further that the Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and self-employment taxes—
:(1) raise the cost of employment;
:(2) destroy jobs and cause unemployment; and
:(3) have a disproportionately adverse impact on lower income Americans.

==(c) Findings Relating to Federal Estate and Gift Taxes– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds further that the Federal estate and gift taxes—
:(1) force family businesses and farms to be sold by the family to pay such taxes;
:(2) discourage capital formation and entrepreneurship;
:(3) foster the continued dominance of large enterprises over small family-owned companies and farms; and
:(4) impose unacceptably high tax planning costs on small businesses and farms.

==(d) Findings Relating to National Sales Tax– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds further that a broad-based national sales tax on goods and services purchased for final consumption—
:(1) is similar in many respects to the sales and use taxes in place in 45 of the 50 States;
:(2) will promote savings and investment;
:(3) will promote fairness;
:(4) will promote economic growth;
:(5) will raise the standard of living;
:(6) will increase investment;
:(7) will enhance productivity and international competitiveness;
:(8) will reduce administrative burdens on the American taxpayer;
:(9) will improve upward social mobility; and
:(10) will respect the privacy interests and civil rights of taxpayers.

==(e) Findings Relating to Administration of National Sales Tax– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] further finds that—
:(1) most of the practical experience administering sales taxes is found at the State governmental level;
:(2) it is desirable to harmonize Federal and State collection and enforcement efforts to the maximum extent possible;
:(3) it is sound tax administration policy to foster administration and collection of the Federal sales tax at the State level in return for a reasonable administration fee to the States; and
:(4) businesses that must collect and remit taxes should receive reasonable compensation for the cost of doing so.

==(f) Findings Relating to Repeal of Present Federal Tax System– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] further finds that the 16th amendment to the United States Constitution should be repealed.
