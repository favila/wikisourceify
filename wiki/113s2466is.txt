 To amend the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to include the desecration of cemeteries among the many forms of violations of the right to religious freedom.   

=Section 1. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Cemeteries are sacred sites that are of great spiritual, cultural, and historical significance to many religious and ethnic groups.
:(2) Congress is committed to protecting and preserving the heritage and sacred sites of national, religious, and ethnic groups, which include cemeteries in the United States and abroad.
:(3) Cemeteries around the world have, and continue to be, defaced or destroyed as a direct result of their affiliation with a particular religious or spiritual group.
:(4) Such attacks constitute an assault on the fundamental right to freedom of religion, and are especially egregious when sponsored or tolerated by the local or national governments in the countries in which such offenses occur. 

=Sec. 2. Amendment to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998=

   Section 2(a)(4) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/6401 22 U.S.C. 6401(a)(4)] )is amended by inserting“desecration of cemeteries,”after“confiscations of property,”.
