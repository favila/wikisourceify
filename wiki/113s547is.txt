{{Center|A BILL}}

To prevent a fiscal crisis by enacting legislation to balance the Federal budget through reductions of discretionary and mandatory spending.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “One Percent Spending Reduction Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Congressional findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The fiscal crisis faced by the Federal Government demands immediate action.
:(2) The dramatic growth in spending and debt in recent years threatens our economic and national security:
::(A) Federal spending has grown from 18 percent of GDP in 2001 to nearly 23 percent of GDP in 2012.
::(B) Total Federal debt exceeds $16,000,000,000,000 and is projected to increase each year over the next 10 years.
::(C) Without action, the Federal Government will continue to run massive deficits in the next decade and total Federal debt will rise to $26,000,000,000,000 by 2023.
::(D) Interest payments on this debt will soon rise to the point where balancing the budget as a matter of policy is beyond the reach of Congress.
:(3) Due to recent tax hikes, Federal revenues are scheduled to rise to approximately 19 percent of GDP, a full percentage point above the average of about 18 percent of GDP over the past 40 years.
:(4) Absent reform, the growth of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health-related spending will overwhelm all other Federal programs and consume all projected tax revenues.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to address the fiscal crisis by—
:(1) acting quickly to balance the Federal budget and eliminate the parade of deficits and ballooning interest payments;
:(2) achieving balance by reducing spending one percent per year until spending equals projected long-term revenues; and
:(3) reforming entitlement programs to ensure long-term fiscal stability and balance.
