{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

Recognizing February 19, 2013 as the centennial of Mosaic, a faith-based organization that was founded in Nebraska and now serves more than 3,600 individuals with intellectual disabilities in 10 States.Whereas the roots of Mosaic, a faith-based organization that serves individuals with intellectual disabilities, trace back to the commitment of a Nebraskan to ensure that individuals with disabilities were cared for and inspired by a loving community;Whereas, on February 19, 1913, a Nebraska pastor, the Reverend K.G. William Dahl, founded Bethphage Inner Mission Association (referred to in this preamble as “Bethphage” ) in Axtell, Nebraska as a ministry for individuals with intellectual disabilities;Whereas, on October 20, 1925, a school endeavoring to create opportunities for children with disabilities took root in Sterling, Nebraska when the Reverends Julius Moehl, August Hoeger, and William Fruehling, and laymen John Aden and William Ehmen, established Martin Luther Home Society, which later became known as Martin Luther Homes;Whereas, with the increasing need for community-based programs for individuals with disabilities in the 1970s and 1980s, both Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes grew into ministries that served locations across the United States;Whereas the shared vision and mission of the 2 Nebraska-born ministries, to care for the most vulnerable individuals, laid the foundation for the formation of a powerful partnership;Whereas, on July 1, 2003, Mosaic was officially established through a consolidation of Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes; andWhereas Mosaic has created a legacy of love, providing individualized support to thousands of individuals in the United States and extending its work beyond the borders of the United States through an international alliance: Now therefore be it
