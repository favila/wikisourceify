=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The Government of North Korea has repeatedly violated its commitments to the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programs, and has willfully violated multiple [[w:United Nations|United Nations Security Council]]resolutions calling for it to cease its development, testing, and production of weapons of mass destruction.
:(2) North Korea poses a grave risk for the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
:(3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated repeatedly in money laundering and illicit activities, including prohibited arms sales, narcotics trafficking, the counterfeiting of United States currency, and the counterfeiting of intellectual property of United States persons.
:(4) The Government of North Korea has, both historically and recently, repeatedly sponsored acts of international terrorism, including attempts to assassinate defectors and human rights activists, repeated threats of violence against foreign persons, leaders, newspapers, and cities, and the shipment of weapons to terrorists.
:(5) North Korea has unilaterally withdrawn from the 1953 Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and committed provocations against South Korea in 2010 by sinking the warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her crew, and by shelling Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans.
:(6) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political prison camps that contain as many as 200,000 men, women, and children, who live in atrocious living conditions with insufficient food, clothing, and medical care, and under constant fear of torture or arbitrary execution.
:(7) The Congress reaffirms the purposes of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 contained in  section 4 of such Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/7802 22 U.S.C. 7802] ).
:(8) North Korea has prioritized weapons programs and the procurement of luxury goods, in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and in gross disregard of the needs of its people.
:(9) Persons, including financial institutions, who engage in transactions with, or provide financial services to, the Government of North Korea and its financial institutions without establishing sufficient financial safeguards against North Korea’s use of these transactions to promote proliferation, weapons trafficking, human rights violations, illicit activity, and the purchase of luxury goods, aid and abet North Korea’s misuse of the international financial system, and also violate the intent of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
:(10) The Government of North Korea’s conduct poses an imminent threat to the security of the United States and its allies, to the global economy, to the safety of members of the United States armed forces, to the integrity of the global financial system, to the integrity of global nonproliferation programs, and to the people of North Korea.
:(11) The Congress seeks, through this legislation, to use nonmilitary means to address this crisis, to provide diplomatic leverage to negotiate necessary changes in North Korea’s conduct, and to ease the suffering of the people of North Korea.

Congress makes the following findings:
:(1) The Undersecretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who is responsible for safeguarding the financial system against illicit use, money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, has repeatedly expressed concern about North Korea’s misuse of the international financial system as follows:
::(A) In 2006, the Undersecretary stated that, given North Korea’s“counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics trafficking and use of accounts worldwide to conduct proliferation-related transactions, the line between illicit and licit North Korean money is nearly invisible”and urged financial institutions worldwide to“think carefully about the risks of doing any North Korea-related business.”.
::(B) In 2011, the Undersecretary stated that“North Korea remains intent on engaging in proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in material,”and was“aggressively pursuing the effort to establish front companies.”.
::(C) In 2013, the Undersecretary stated, in reference to North Korea’s distribution of high-quality counterfeit United States currency, that“North Korea is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the international financial system,”and that the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]would soon introduce new currency with improved security features to protect against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea.

::(B) decided that Member States should apply enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the provision of financial services or the transfer of property that could contribute to activities prohibited by applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions; and
::(C) called on Member States to prohibit North Korean banks from establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships with banks in their jurisdictions, to prevent the provision of financial services, if they have information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that these activities could contribute to activities prohibited by an applicable United Nations Security Council resolution, or to the evasion of such prohibitions.
