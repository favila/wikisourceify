:(4) By the end of the current tax return filing season, it is estimated that the IRS Free File program will have saved taxpayers approximately $1,110,000,000 and will have saved the Federal Government hundreds of millions of dollars.
:(5) Under the IRS Free File program, the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the companies participating in the program have made substantial improvements to the program to provide better products and services to eligible taxpayers.
:(6) The IRS Free File program must be maintained in order to reach and maintain Congress’ goal as set forth in the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998of having 80 percent of all Federal individual income tax returns filed electronically.
:(7) The [[w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the participating tax preparation companies have integrated the IRS Free File program with State tax systems to enable taxpayers to also file their State tax returns in conjunction with their IRS Free File filings.
:(8) Twenty-two States and the District of Columbia now operate a Free File program patterned after the IRS Free File program again at no cost to the State taxpayers or the State governments.
