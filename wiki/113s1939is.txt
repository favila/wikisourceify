To repeal the War Powers Resolution and to provide for proper war powers consultation, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “ War Powers Consultation Act of 2014” .

=Sec. 2. Findings; purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The War Powers Resolution( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1541 50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq] .)has not worked as intended, and has added to the divisiveness and uncertainty that exists regarding the war powers of the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] .
:(2) The American people want both the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] involved in the decisionmaking process when United States Armed Forces are committed to significant armed conflict, and the involvement of both branches is important in building domestic understanding and political support for doing so and ensuring the soundness of the resulting decision.
:(3) Past efforts to call upon the judicial branch to define the constitutional limits of the war powers of the executive and legislative branches of government have generally failed because courts, for the most part, have declined jurisdiction on the grounds that the issues involved are “political questions” or that the plaintiffs lack standing.
:(4) It harms the country to have the War Powers Resolution, the centerpiece statute in this vital area of United States law, regularly and openly questioned or ignored.
:(5) The country needs to replace the War Powers Resolution with a constructive means by which the judgment of both the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] can be brought to bear when deciding whether the United States should engage in a significant armed conflict, without prejudice to the rights of either branch to assert its constitutional war powers or to challenge the constitutional war powers of the other branch.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to establish a constructive and practical means by which the judgment of both the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] and [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] can be brought to bear when deciding whether the United States should engage in a significant armed conflict. This Act is not meant to define, circumscribe, or enhance the constitutional war powers of either the executive or legislative branch of government, and neither branch by supporting or complying with this Act shall in any way limit or prejudice its right or ability to assert its constitutional war powers or its right or ability to question or challenge the constitutional war powers of the other branch.

=Sec. 3. Significant armed conflict defined=

:(2) Limited acts of reprisal against terrorists or states that sponsor terrorism.
