This Act may be cited as the“ Small Business Credit Card Act of 2013 ”.

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds as follows:
:(1) Economic growth has frequently been led by the creation of millions of new, small businesses.
:(2) Today, small business owners are severely limited in their ability to finance new business ventures because access to capital through traditional resources has been restricted.
:(3) Small businesses are being pushed into using credit cards to meet capital needs.
:(4) This use of credit cards is especially true for innovative and rapidly growing businesses which lack the assets necessary for a traditional loan.
:(5) In 2012, 31 percent of the small businesses surveyed used credit cards to meet their capital needs.
:(6) In 1993, only 16 percent of small businesses used credit cards as a source of financing.
:(7) One-half of small businesses using a credit card carry a monthly balance, and one-quarter of small businesses carry a monthly balance in excess of $10,000.
:(8) The average interest rate charged on small business credit cards is 15.6 percent.
:(9) Nearly one-half of small businesses with credit cards have reported a worsening of terms, including increased interest rates, fees, and payment procedures, making it more difficult to expand operations or grow business.
:(10) Small business credit cards contracts do not include consumer protections provided to individuals under the CARD Act .
