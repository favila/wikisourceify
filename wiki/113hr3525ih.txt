To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide assistance for the treatment of hydrocephalus in children in developing countries, to train surgeons and other medical practitioners in innovative methods to treat and cure hydrocephalus, to fund related research, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “International Hydrocephalus Treatment and Training Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Hydrocephalus, also known as “water on the brain” , is a medical condition in which an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles or cavities of the brain causes increased intracranial pressure inside the skull and progressive enlargement of the head.
:(2) If left untreated, hydrocephalus leads to physical and mental disabilities and eventually death.
:(3) Hydrocephalus is an extremely painful condition that most commonly occurs in infants and young children as a result of a congenital abnormality (anatomic abnormality, aqueductal stenosis, spina bifida or encephalocele), or post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) caused by infections acquired after birth, such as meningitis, that attack the brain.
:(4) PIH is the most common cause of hydrocephalus globally, accounting for approximately 60 percent of all cases.
:(5) Three to five out of every 1,000 newborns in developing countries are either born with hydrocephalus or acquire it due to neonatal infections in the first few months of life.
:(6) It is conservatively estimated that more than 300,000 children are born with or acquire hydrocephalus in the developing world each year.
:(7) Children with hydrocephalus who are not effectively treated or who are not treated in the early stages of the condition suffer from cognitive deficiencies or physical disabilities or both.
:(8) Families of children who have hydrocephalus in developing countries rarely know that it is a treatable condition, where to go for treatment, or how to care for a child suffering from the condition.
:(9) Many children with hydrocephalus in developing countries are abandoned, ostracized, or abused due to their appearance and physical and mental disabilities.
:(10) Hydrocephalus can be treated, and advances in innovative medical procedures such as ETV/CPC have the potential to save thousands of lives annually and prevent or mitigate physical and mental disabilities in thousands of children in developing countries.
:(11) The current standard treatment for hydrocephalus is the VP shunt which often requires up to 5 surgical revisions before a child reaches adulthood to remedy blockages in the shunt and to account for the child’s growth. Blockages can be expected during the life of the patient and can lead to death, particularly in developing countries where access to the requisite medical expertise often is not available.
:(12) Due to the need for multiple replacements of a VP shunt, this treatment is expensive and creates an increased burden on fragile health systems, patients, and families.
:(13) ETV/CPC is a shunt-less surgery for hydrocephalus that does not require a VP shunt and has been shown to be appropriate in at least two-thirds of the cases of infants with hydrocephalus. Of those cases, ETV/CPC is 93 percent effective in eliminating hydrocephalus.
:(14) Few hospitals with the expertise and capacity to treat hydrocephalus exist in developing countries, and the demand for treatment far exceeds the capacity of health systems in those countries.
:(15) Neurosurgical care for hydrocephalus in developing countries is widely unavailable due to a lack of trained neurosurgeons. In East Africa, there is only 1 neurosurgeon per 10,000,000 people. In many developing countries there are no trained neurosurgeons.
:(16) Hundreds of thousands of cases of hydrocephalus in children in developing countries could be successfully treated if adequate resources are devoted to training surgeons in new techniques, such as ETV/CPC, and many future cases could be prevented if adequate resources are devoted to research means to mitigate the preventable causes of hydrocephalus.
:(17) Adoption of innovative new techniques to treat hydrocephalus, such as ETV/CPC, are more cost effective in the long term than current treatment methods since only one surgery is required in most cases, thus limiting the impact on overburdened health systems in developing countries.

=Sec. 3. Assistance to treat hydrocephalus and train surgeons=

 Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2151 22 U.S.C. 2151 et. seq.] )is amended—
:(1) by redesignating the second section 135(as added by section 5(a) of the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005([[Public Law 109-121|Public Law 109–121]] ;119 Stat. 2536)) as section 136; and
:(2) by adding at the end the following:

<blockquote>

==Sec. 137. Assistance to treat hydrocephalus and train surgeons==



===(a) Purposes– ===

The purposes of assistance authorized by this section are—
:(1) to ensure that life-saving treatment of hydrocephalus is an important priority of United States bilateral foreign assistance, including through promotion of innovative treatments and training of medical practitioners from the developing world in the latest treatment protocols and best practices for the treatment of hydrocephalus, including—
::(A) surgery and post-surgery care in developing countries;
::(B) the creation of a comprehensive hydrocephalus training program based in the developing world for surgeons and key members of their medical team; and
::(C) the training of medical practitioners based in the developing world in ETV/CPC and other appropriate treatment protocols; and
:(2) to promote research to reduce the incidence of PIH epidemiology, pathophysiology, and disease burden, and to improve treatment of hydrocephalus.

===(b) Authorization– ===

To carry out the purposes of subsection (a), the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] is authorized to provide assistance to support a network of trained medical practitioners to treat hydrocephalus in children at pediatric hospitals and hydrocephalus treatment centers in developing countries with a high incidence of hydrocephalus.

===(c) Activities supported– ===



====(1) Comprehensive program– ====



=====(A) In general– =====
