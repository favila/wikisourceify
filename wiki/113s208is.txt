={{anchor|id08cb829a618842aaaaad4c7190f16a83}}Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Residents throughout Los Angeles County suffer intrusive and disruptive low-flying helicopter traffic above their neighborhoods. The unique terrain of canyons and valleys that surround residential neighborhoods in Los Angeles County often concentrate high decibel level noise from the low-flying helicopters in and around Los Angeles County residences. The concentrated noise interrupts daily life for many Los Angeles County residents by drowning out conversations and disrupting sleep cycles.
:(2) Los Angeles County is home to a uniquely large concentration of scenic, historic, entertainment, and transportation venues, including sight-seeing, movie studios, movie star homes, outdoor entertainment facilities, Griffith Park, the Hollywood Sign, freeways, and many others, that generate extensive helicopter activity.
:(3) Los Angeles County is home to the world’s leading civil helicopter manufacturer that conducts extensive helicopter operational testing across the region.
:(4) Despite multiple efforts from several community and homeowner organizations in Los Angeles County to address these disturbances, helicopter traffic in Los Angeles County is not currently regulated by the [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration]] or any other agency.
:(5) At the request of members of Congress, the [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration]] formed an internal working group in July 2012 to solicit input from local communities and stakeholders on helicopter noise and safety issues in Los Angeles County.
:(6) As part of that process, several public meetings were held in the fall and summer of 2012 that have allowed the [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration]] and stakeholders to hear and better understand the concerns and complaints of affected residents.
:(7) The [[w:Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration]] is scheduled to release a report in May 2013 evaluating a full set of voluntary and regulatory options to reduce helicopter noise and address safety issues in Los Angeles County.
:(8) The report is expected to explore how helicopters can be regulated in Los Angeles County in a manner that provides relief to residents from helicopter noise while also meeting the needs of relevant stakeholders, including first responders.
