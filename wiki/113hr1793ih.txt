=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) In an increasingly interdependent world, the health, prosperity, freedom, and security of the people of the United States are strengthened when the people of all countries can enjoy these same advantages.
:(2) The development of a healthier, more peaceful, democratic, just and prosperous world requires the sustained and substantial investment of United States human and financial resources in fostering international cooperation and in building the capacity of other countries to meet the needs of their people and to conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.
:(3) Foreign assistance is not only a reflection of the values, generosity, and goodwill of the people of the United States, but also an essential means for achieving United States foreign policy, economic, and national security objectives.

=Sec. 3. Statement of policy=

It is the policy of the United States to help build and sustain an international community composed of states that meet basic human needs, resolve conflicts peacefully, respect fundamental freedoms, cooperate to address issues that transcend national boundaries, use wisely the world’s limited resources in a sustainable manner, and work toward the achievement of economic well-being for all people.

=Sec. 4. Principles of assistance=

In order to maximize effectiveness and efficiency, United States foreign assistance should be carried out in accordance with the following principles:
:(1) Foreign assistance is not an end in itself. The purpose of foreign assistance is to create the conditions under which it is no longer needed.
:(2) United States foreign assistance should support the development of human, financial, organizational, and technical capacity of partner countries, both within government and among civil society, that is sustainable over the long term and leads to self-reliance.
:(3) United States foreign assistance, regardless of type, purpose, or recipient, should respect human rights and democratic processes.
:(4) United States embassies and [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]] missions in partner countries should be accorded a central role in planning, budgeting, and decisionmaking with respect to United States foreign assistance to those countries.
:(5) United States foreign assistance programs should be carried out in collaboration with a wide variety of partners, including multilateral organizations, governments of partner countries at all levels, intermediate representative institutions, and international, United States, and local civil society organizations.
:(6) Nonemergency United States foreign assistance should be provided pursuant to well-coordinated strategies with specific goals and measurable objectives, while preserving the flexibility to respond to rapidly changing situations.
:(7) Monitoring and evaluation of United States foreign assistance should be conducted systematically to ensure financial accountability, evaluate performance, assess impact, determine lessons learned, disseminate findings, and identify steps for improvement.
:(8) Because gender equality is essential to democracy, human rights and economic development, the needs, views, rights, roles, and resources of women should be taken into account in all stages of the foreign assistance process, including strategic planning, budgeting, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.
:(9) Because natural resources and a healthy, functioning environment underpin sustainable economic growth, health, and food security, the likely impact of United States foreign assistance policies and programs upon the environment should be taken into account in all stages of the foreign assistance process. Effective action should be taken to mitigate any negative impacts and to ensure that all people enjoy the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards.
:(10) The United States Government should publish timely, detailed, and comprehensive information on the budgeting, delivery, and expenditure of United States foreign assistance in order to enhance transparency and accountability for results and should encourage and facilitate similar transparency by the partner country regarding its national budget, government contracts, and aid-related expenditures.
:(11) United States foreign assistance should be conducted within a coherent and coordinated structure that establishes clear lines of authority, delineates responsibilities, rationalizes functions, closes gaps, promotes policy consistency, and ensures civilian leadership.
:(12) To ensure that United States foreign assistance achieves its intended objectives and to maximize its impact, the United States Government should design and implement such assistance in partnership with local stakeholders, including as appropriate and feasible, governments, intermediate representative institutions, civil society organizations, and affected communities.
:(13) The success of United States foreign assistance in meeting humanitarian, foreign policy, and national security objectives depends on the sustained commitment of adequate and reliable budgetary resources as well as on the development, training, and maintenance of a diverse and experienced corps of professionals to design, manage, implement, and monitor such foreign assistance.

==Title I— Reducing global poverty and alleviating human suffering==



==Sec. 1001. Findings==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, which affect more than a billion people around the world, are inimical to the achievement of a healthy, peaceful, democratic, just and prosperous world and an affront to shared human values.
:(2) A principal objective of United States foreign policy is reducing global poverty and its worst physical manifestations through the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to building the economic, political, and social institutions that will improve the quality of their lives.
:(3) Strengthening democratic governance and the political voice of poor and marginalized groups not only directly combats poverty but also helps build responsive, accountable state institutions essential to sustain the positive impact of foreign assistance over the long-term.
:(4) United States efforts to reduce global poverty and alleviate human suffering reflect the compassion and generosity of the American people, while also serving United States economic and national security interests. Poor and unstable countries make unreliable trading partners and weak markets for United States goods and services. Violent extremism that threatens United States national security flourishes where democratic governance is weak, justice is uncertain, and legal avenues for change are in short supply.
:(5) Complementing the long-term objective of reducing global poverty, the humanitarian concern and tradition of the people of the United States demands a commitment to saving lives and alleviating human suffering resulting from natural and human-caused disasters, and to taking effective action to prevent, prepare for, and mitigate such disasters.
:(6) Pursuit of these interrelated objectives requires that development and humanitarian concerns be fully reflected throughout United States foreign policy, and that resources for these purposes be adequately and reliably budgeted and effectively and efficiently utilized.
:(7) In order to achieve United States foreign policy and national security objectives, the United States should act in concert with other countries and multilateral institutions to mobilize adequate resources from public and private sources for poverty reduction and humanitarian relief.

==Sec. 1002. Statement of policy==

It is the policy of the United States to undertake best efforts to—
:(1) reduce global poverty, including by establishing and meeting, in cooperation with governments of developing countries, other public and private donors, multilateral institutions, nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and affected communities, international targets for the reduction of poverty; and
:(2) prevent, prepare for, mitigate, and respond to humanitarian crises wherever such crises may occur.

==Sec. 1003. Encouragement of United States private and voluntary cooperation==



===(a) Findings– ===

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The sustained participation of United States private and voluntary organizations, community and faith-based organizations, charitable foundations, labor unions, cooperatives, and credit unions in international development and humanitarian relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction significantly reduces poverty and alleviates human suffering through—
::(A) application of accumulated expertise in the discipline of development;
::(B) provision of social services in underserved communities;
::(C) building the capacity of local organizations to operate with maximum effectiveness, thereby strengthening civil society and advancing self-reliance;
::(D) establishing long-term partnerships with and between local communities, civil society organizations and governments of developing countries at all levels, thus helping to strengthen accountability, reduce corruption, build capable institutions, and sustain progress;
::(E) empowering marginalized groups through access to information and a leadership role in decisionmaking processes; and
::(F) serving as a voice for the poor and bringing best practices and lessons learned to bear on policymaking processes in the United States and worldwide.
:(2) Such organizations, foundations, unions, and cooperatives, by mobilizing private United States financial and human resources, reflect the values and goodwill of the people of the United States and embody the American spirit of self-help.
:(3) Advocacy groups and organizations that represent American political, legal, academic and business life have developed long-standing relationships with their overseas counterparts, helping to build people-to-people networks that strengthen civil society, protect human rights, support democratic institutions and foster a policy environment conducive to economic development.
:(4) Similarly, the sustained participation of United States educational and research institutions in building the scientific, educational, and service capacities of developing countries is vital to the economic and social development of those countries, and at the same time strengthens the faculty and programs available to United States students.
:(5) Because of their ability to attract and leverage private contributions, the entities described in paragraphs (1) through (4)are extremely cost-effective partners for providing foreign assistance.
:(6) Because such entities, often using their own resources, develop and maintain long-term and independent relationships with their counterparts in foreign countries, they provide great expertise in program implementation, an important source of knowledge about local needs, attitudes, customs, and conditions, and a critical means for building trust and goodwill with local communities.

===(b) Statement of policy– ===

It is the policy of the United States to—
:(1) encourage and facilitate, as appropriate, international activities of United States private and voluntary organizations, community and faith-based organizations, charitable foundations, labor unions, cooperatives, credit unions, and educational and research institutions in furtherance of the goals of this title;
:(2) co-design, co-fund, and co-manage projects and strategies with such entities to meet jointly agreed development objectives;
:(3) strengthen the capacity of such entities, without compromising their private and independent nature, to undertake effective international assistance efforts; and
:(4) streamline and simplify the process by which such entities may compete for resources made available under this title.

==Sec. 1004. Encouragement of United States business participation==



===(a) Findings– ===

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) United States businesses, including international development firms, are significant contributors to humanitarian relief and broad-based economic growth in developing countries, through—
::(A) the donation of financial resources, technology, goods, and services;
::(B) the sharing of training, technical, managerial, and business skills;
::(C) the investment of capital and the development of trade relationships;
::(D) the establishment and maintenance of partnerships with the governments of developing countries, local communities, and civil society organizations;
::(E) partnering with local businesses and entrepreneurs;
::(F) the expansion of job opportunities in impoverished communities; and
::(G) the encouragement of private sector development and of the legal and institutional framework to support such development.
:(2) Such businesses are often staffed by individuals with a strong commitment to and knowledge of developing countries, many of whom have served overseas, and who bring American values, know-how, and spirit of innovation.
:(3) While some United States businesses have a long history of engagement with international development, bringing extensive experience, strong local ties and a proven track record of achievement, many others seek to establish first-time partnerships and new joint ventures.
:(4) By leveraging contributions of United States businesses and facilitating public-private partnerships, the United States Government can maximize the impact of its efforts to improve social and economic conditions in developing countries.

===(b) Statement of policy– ===

It is the policy of the United States to—
:(1) encourage and facilitate, to the maximum extent practicable, participation by United States businesses in achieving the purposes of this title;
:(2) promote awareness by United States businesses, including small businesses, of opportunities to promote economic growth and expand markets in developing countries;
:(3) facilitate partnerships between United States business and international and local nongovernmental organizations, including private and voluntary organizations, community and faith-based organizations, charitable foundations, labor unions, cooperatives, credit unions, and educational and research institutions, to reduce poverty and alleviate human suffering;
:(4) build strategic alliances with United States businesses, drawing on their unique assets and experience, to solve complex problems in developing countries; and
:(5) co-design, co-fund, and co-manage projects and strategies with United States business partners to meet jointly agreed development objectives.

==Sec. 1005. Development partnerships fellows program==



===(a) In general– ===

The [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Administrator]] is authorized and encouraged to establish a program of exchanges to strengthen individual and institutional capacity, share knowledge and best practices, build partnering skills and develop networks through professional exchanges between the Agency and the private sector, including businesses and nonprofit institutions.

===(b) Strategic focus– ===

The exchanges authorized under subsection (a)should be designed to fill gaps and build capacity in areas of critical need, as determined by the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Administrator]] and the private sector entity.

===(c) Competitive awards– ===

The process for selecting individuals for the exchanges authorized under subsection (a)should be open and competitive, while offering opportunities to individuals with varying levels of professional experience.

===(d) Status of employment– ===

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the period of exchange—
:(1) each participating individual (hereinafter referred to as a “Fellow” ) shall continue to receive his or her salary, benefits, and rights of employment from the Agency or private sector entity, as the case may be; and
:(2) in the case of a Fellow who is an employee of a private sector entity and is working at the Agency, the Fellow shall not be considered to be a Federal employee of the Agency, except for purposes of obtaining necessary access to buildings, office supplies, equipment and facilities.

===(e) Parity in exchange– ===

The [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Administrator]] shall ensure that the total number of Fellows who are employees of the Agency and are working at private sector entities is substantially equivalent to the total number of Fellows who are employees of private sector entities and are working at the Agency.

===(f) Other costs and expenses– ===

The [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Administrator]] shall prescribe policies and procedures regarding costs and expenses for Fellows other than policies and procedures regarding salaries and benefits.

===(g) Term of service– ===

The [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Administrator]] shall determine appropriate lengths of service for Fellows, except that such service may not exceed a period of 2 years.

===A Reducing global poverty– ===



===Sec. 1011. Findings===

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The goal of international development is to improve the quality of life for all people while preserving that opportunity for future generations.
:(2) Successful economic development includes the eradication of extreme poverty and its worst physical manifestations.
:(3) Abuses of power, failure to respect human rights, exclusion of and discrimination against societal groups, and unchecked violence, particularly against women and girls, are impediments to economic development.
:(4) While each country must marshal its own economic and human resources in order to build and maintain the political, social, and economic institutions necessary to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for its people, the magnitude of the need far exceeds the resources of most developing countries.
:(5) The United States has acknowledged a collective responsibility for, as well as a national interest in, the reduction of global poverty through the promotion of long-term development that is participatory, equitable, self-reliant, and environmentally sustainable.
:(6) A human rights-based approach that focuses on empowering women and girls has been shown to maximize development outcomes.
:(7) Development is a long-term process that requires sustained attention and resources. Foreign assistance to achieve short-term political objectives or meet emergency humanitarian needs should not come at the expense of efforts to address the root causes of poverty and human suffering.

===Sec. 1012. Statement of policy===

It is the policy of the United States to reduce global poverty by helping poor people in developing countries to participate in a process of self-sustaining, equitable, and environmentally sound economic growth through productive work and to influence decisions that shape their lives, with the goal of increasing their incomes and their access to public services that will enable them to satisfy their basic needs, exercise their rights, and lead lives of decency, dignity, and hope.

===Sec. 1013. Principles of assistance===

In order to maximize the reduction of global poverty, assistance under this subtitle should be carried out in accordance with the following principles:
:(1) Development is primarily the responsibility of the people of developing countries themselves. Assistance should be used in support of, rather than substitution for, the self-help efforts that are essential to successful economic development.
:(2) Assistance should be demand-driven and designed to support partner country ownership by respecting the development goals chosen through an open and inclusive process in the partner country.
:(3) The United States Government should work to broaden country-level policy dialogue on development by promoting an open and inclusive process for choosing development goals, and by increasing the capacity of all stakeholders to participate meaningfully in that process.
:(4) Persons affected by conflict or disaster—including refugees, stateless persons, and internally displaced persons, particularly those in protracted situations—are among the world’s most vulnerable to poverty, exclusion, exploitation and other abuses. Although they have tremendous potential to contribute to the growth and development of the communities and countries where they reside, these populations often lack access to development resources and programs. Such populations, as well as other marginalized groups, must be explicitly included in country development programs and national development strategies.
:(5) Assistance should be concentrated in countries that have the greatest need for outside assistance and that will make the most effective use of such assistance in achieving the purposes of this subtitle.
:(6) Program selection and design should be linked to results, by using performance frameworks and indicators that are included in or consistent with a developing country’s national development strategy, where possible, and by strengthening the country’s capacity and demand for results-based management.
:(7) When partner country systems are transparent, accountable and effective, the United States Government should use such systems for delivering assistance. Where use of such systems is not feasible, the United States should establish additional safeguards and measures in ways that strengthen rather than undermine country systems.
:(8) Even in countries where there is a strong and capable state, civil society should be included in the planning, design, management, delivery, monitoring and evaluation of foreign assistance.
:(9) Assistance should focus on building the self-sufficiency of developing countries by upgrading human, technical, and institutional capacity, both inside and outside government, to effectively plan, manage, implement, monitor, and evaluate budgets, policies, and programs in a transparent and accountable manner that supports development objectives.
:(10) The United States Government should take all appropriate steps to harmonize its planning, funding, conditionality, disbursement, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting with governments of developing countries and with other donors, including multilateral institutions, in order to simplify and reduce the administrative burdens, achieve a more effective division of labor that builds on donors’ comparative advantages, and improve accountability for results.
:(11) In consultation with [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] and in conjunction with the Interagency Policy Committee on Global Development established under section 1020, the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|Administrator]] should engage in strategic and budgetary planning over a 3- to 5-year period that will enable the disbursement of assistance in a more timely and predictable manner.
:(12) Personnel and management systems of the Agency should incorporate incentives for innovation and experimentation, with tolerance of reasonable risk-taking and training on risk-management.
:(13) Poverty reduction efforts should promote a policy environment and legal framework that is conducive to broad-based and sustainable economic growth, including—
::(A) respect for the rule of law;
::(B) fair, accessible, and timely administration of justice;
::(C) representative and accountable institutions of governance;
::(D) protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms;
::(E) mechanisms of accountability and transparency;
::(F) security of person, property and investments;
::(G) enforcement of contracts and intellectual property rights;
::(H) encouragement of private enterprise, free markets and labor rights; and
::(I) a vibrant and informed civil society.
:(14) An effective United States strategy to promote global poverty reduction and contribute to broad-based, sustainable economic growth must incorporate all United States policies having an impact on development, which include foreign assistance, debt relief, trade, agriculture, migration and remittances, environmental protection, technology transfer, and arms sales.
:(15) Assistance should be provided in a manner that is flexible enough to adapt to the unique needs and capabilities of specific developing countries and changing situations on the ground, while remaining transparent and predictable enough to allow developing countries and other partners to plan and budget efficiently.
:(16) Assistance should give priority to undertakings that will directly improve the lives of the poorest, most vulnerable and marginalized groups, and strengthen their capacity to participate in the political, economic, and social development of their countries.
:(17) Investments in research, the fostering of innovation and the application of technology are essential to expanding the impact and effectiveness of development policies and programs. To ensure that such research, innovation and technology are appropriately harnessed, development assistance policies and programs should promote data collection and rigorous analysis, evidence-based decisionmaking, a culture of learning, a mechanism for scaling up successful methods and activities, and a process for sharing best practices.
:(18) Gender equality is a matter of fundamental human rights, as well as being essential to the reduction of poverty and to the health, education and well-being of families and communities.

:(21) International and United Nations-affiliated agencies and multilateral development institutions are essential components of United States poverty reduction efforts. The United States Government should recognize the comparative advantages of such institutions, particularly with respect to investments in capital-intensive projects and in countries and regions where the United States does not have a large physical presence, while supporting reforms to make such institutions more accountable, responsive, and representative. In addition to direct financial contributions, the United States Government should provide technical and logistical assistance to such institutions as appropriate.
:(22) Private investment and philanthropy and individual remittances are increasingly important sources of development resources. The United States Government should help to link the United States private sector with appropriate local partners, to encourage private investment in economic and social development programs to which the United States lends support, and to ensure complementarity between public and private development efforts.
:(23) Assistance should be planned and utilized to encourage regional cooperation among developing countries in the solution of common problems and the development of shared resources.

====1 Accelerating Economic Growth– ====



====Sec. 1101. Findings and statement of policy====



=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Broad-based and sustainable economic growth is the most powerful engine for reducing poverty, and is key to advancing human development. It is the surest way for countries to generate the resources they need to address illiteracy, poor health, and other development challenges on their own.
:(2) By expanding incomes, economic growth helps families and individuals not only to meet their basic needs, but also to realize their unique capabilities, exercise greater freedom in their lives, and achieve their full human potential.
:(3) Economic growth enables countries to offer better markets for United States goods and services and to become more effective partners with the United States in working toward a more stable, healthy, and prosperous world.
:(4) Well-functioning, dynamic private markets promote economic activity and accelerate growth, providing increased incomes and employment.
:(5) To encourage entrepreneurship and private investment, developing countries must create a favorable legal, policy and regulatory environment; an efficient and accountable system of public financial management; fair, transparent and predictable enforcement of property rights and contracts; effective procedures for resolving economic disputes among firms and individuals; and rigorous efforts to stem bribery and corruption.
:(6) Even where markets are functioning well, differential access to education, technology, credit and other resources can cause economic benefits to be uneven. Expanding economic opportunity and access to the tools that help citizens engage in the market economy enables the poor, women and other marginalized groups to participate in and contribute to economic growth.
:(7) An abundance of young people in a country with a weak economy and non-responsive government can leave individuals frustrated by the lack of jobs and opportunities. But youth are also key human resources for growth and positive change. When governments embrace policies that promote education, economic opportunities, the empowerment of women, and equitable access to resources, countries can capitalize on the productivity of a growing workforce to boost economic growth.
:(8) Expanding trade regionally and internationally is critical for many of the smallest and poorest developing countries, where local demand is too weak to support large-scale expansion of production, employment, and incomes. Building trade capacity and removing trade barriers are essential to lasting economic growth.
:(9) Heavy debt burdens, often accumulated under prior, undemocratic regimes, can undermine the ability of developing countries to invest in their people and make progress fighting poverty.
:(10) United States international trade and economic policies are often formulated with little recognition or consideration of their impact on developing countries. More active participation by the Agency in interagency decisionmaking processes can help achieve greater balance among competing United States interests, ensuring that development is duly considered as a priority of United States foreign policy.

=====(b) Statement of policy– =====

It is the policy of the United States to work in cooperation with the international community to help partner countries achieve broad-based and sustainable economic growth that—
:(1) includes all major income groups, marginalized groups and women;

:(1) Access by women and the poor to financial and business development services is a vital factor in reducing poverty and promoting sustainable economic growth in developing countries.
:(2) Microfinance and microenterprise development programs have demonstrated high impact and long-term sustainability because they build capacity for self-help among the poor, especially women, thereby broadening the base for and increasing the inclusiveness of economic growth.
:(3) In order to ensure that microenterprise programs promote the maximum financial inclusion of women, gender analysis should be integrated into microenterprise program design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
:(4) A comprehensive approach to microenterprise development includes support for the provision of credit, savings, insurance, education and training, technical assistance, business development, and other financial services to women, poor people, and other marginalized groups.
:(5) Microenterprise development and microfinance are particularly important to enhancing the livelihoods of refugees, displaced persons, and those affected by conflict, whose routine employment opportunities and access to productive resources have been reduced or disrupted.
:(6) Microenterprise and microfinance activities should be thoroughly integrated into all aspects of development, especially including agriculture and health.
:(7) United States Government support for microfinance and microenterprise development should complement private initiatives in this area by focusing on those who lack access to formal financial services, and on countries and sectors that have been underserved by private capital flows.
:(8) United States Government funds should be used to catalyze and attract additional resources, including private sector funds, investment funds, and the savings of the poor, such as through matching fund opportunities and challenge grants.
:(9) United States Government-supported microfinance lending should accept a higher level of risk than private lending in order to promote innovative products and methodologies and serve poorer and harder-to-reach populations.
:(10) United States Government support for microenterprise development and microfinance should build the capacity of local institutions in order to enable them to better meet the credit, savings, and training needs of microfinance and microenterprise clients.
:(11) Microfinance and microenterprise activities, especially those benefitting the very poor, should be a significant component of development assistance.

=====(b) Statement of policy– =====

=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Hunger robs the poor of a healthy and productive life and stunts the mental and physical development of the next generation. The persistence of widespread hunger and malnutrition constitutes an affront to shared moral values and humanitarian principles.
:(2) Food insecurity and chronic hunger are expanding rapidly in developing countries, forcing millions of people into poverty, contributing to political and social instability, eroding economic growth, and undermining investments in basic education, health, environmental protection, and democratic institutions.
:(3) Volatility and real increases in food prices, which are expected to grow as grain production fails to keep pace with rising demand, cause food insecurity and hunger for poor people even when sufficient food is available on the market.
:(4) The changing global climate, as well as the degradation of land and water resources, threatens food security, livelihoods and the environment worldwide but particularly for those already most vulnerable: the millions of rural poor in developing countries.
:(5) The pressures on world food supplies and agricultural land use caused by population growth, rapid urbanization, energy, agricultural and trade policies in industrialized countries, water scarcity, and climate change require a global commitment to sustainable agriculture and the environment.
:(6) Lack of transparent regulations, inconsistent and unpredictable public policies in developing and developed countries, and unreliable mechanisms to enforce contracts between businesses serve to undermine development goals, deter private investment, and limit the ability of agricultural producers and businesses to access capital. This situation reduces the incentives for agricultural producers to increase the quantity, quality, and value of their agricultural production.
:(7) Reducing chronic hunger is essential to build a foundation for investments in health, education and economic growth. It is critical to the security and productivity of individuals, families, communities, and nations.
:(8) Approximately three-quarters of people in developing countries live in rural areas, with the vast majority dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. Agricultural development is a proven engine of growth that reduces global hunger and poverty.
:(9) Women will be a pivotal force behind achieving a food secure world. In many developing countries, farming is done mostly by women. However, women only own 2 percent of land worldwide and often have limited access to agriculture inputs, loans, and opportunities to learn about improved techniques. When gains in income are controlled by women, they are more likely to be spent on food and children’s needs, thus amplifying the benefits of investments in women across families and generations.
:(10) The 1,000 days between a woman’s pregnancy and her child’s second birthday offer a unique window of opportunity to help families, communities, and countries break the cycle of poverty. Solutions to improve maternal and child nutrition in the 1,000-day window are readily available, affordable, and cost-effective, including vitamins and minerals and good nutritional practices, such as breastfeeding.
:(11) A comprehensive approach to long-term food security should encompass improvements in—
::(A) food availability, such that sufficient quantities of appropriate, necessary types of food are consistently available to all persons;
::(B) food access, such that individuals have adequate incomes or other resources to consistently maintain an adequate diet, and food is allocated equitably within households;
::(C) food utilization and consumption, such that people have the knowledge and basic sanitary conditions to choose, store, prepare and distribute food in a way that results in good nutrition for all family members;
::(D) stability, such that the ability to access and utilize food remains stable and sustained over time, regardless of adverse weather conditions, political instability, or economic factors; and
::(E) food quality and safety, such that food supplies provide adequate nutritional value, are free of contamination, and are fit for human consumption.
:(12) The greatest potential for significantly expanding availability of food for people in rural areas and augmenting world food production at relatively low cost lies in increasing the productivity of small farmers, who constitute a majority of the agricultural producers in developing countries.
:(13) However, increasing the efficiency of agricultural producers alone will not result in higher incomes and reduced hunger unless surplus harvest and products can be sold in well-functioning local, national, regional, or international markets. Development of strong, integrated, local, national, and regional agriculture and food markets will increase the availability of safe and nutritious food, decrease local prices, and expand economic growth.
:(14) The United States should emphasize policies and programs that assist developing countries to increase their national food security by improving their food policies and management and by strengthening national food reserves, with particular concern for the needs of the poor, through measures encouraging domestic production.
:(15) The long-term food security of developing countries requires that adequate legal and procedural mechanisms are in place to protect local rights and the welfare of rural poor people who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.
:(16) While the United States cannot be expected to shoulder the majority of global investments in ending hunger and providing food security, the United States can and should lead the international community by demonstrating a sustained commitment and a comprehensive approach to meeting international goals and targets for reducing hunger and undernutrition.
:(17) Partner countries should decide their needs, priorities, and strategies for agricultural development and food security through an open, participatory and inclusive process that takes into account the needs and views of poor people, women, and other marginalized groups. International efforts to improve food security and nutritional status are not sustainable over the long term without robust leadership and ownership by partner countries.
:(18) Nongovernmental organizations and cooperatives are particularly important for combating food insecurity and increasing the sustainability of public investments. Given their close ties to local communities, such organizations and cooperatives are often effective at ensuring that people who are very poor and vulnerable are consulted about and benefit from agricultural and nutrition programs.
:(19) Educational and research institutions play a key role in developing the institutional capacity and human resources of developing countries, including the establishment and strengthening of agricultural research and extension services, the development of networks for scientific collaboration, the dissemination of improved methods and technologies, and the training of students, teachers, researchers and practitioners.
:(20) With their convening authority and technical expertise, multilateral institutions play a central role in efforts to enhance food security by providing emergency assistance, undertaking research and analysis, offering a platform for sector-wide investments in agriculture, and providing a significant portion of the external financing for investment projects and programs in developing countries. They are important not only to mobilizing and coordinating donor country commitments, but also to promoting global mutual accountability among donors, partner countries and other stakeholders.
:(21) Public sector investments alone, while important, are not sufficient to sustainably reduce poverty and food insecurity. The private sector brings necessary financial resources, human capital, technological resources, intellectual property, market access, cutting-edge business practices, in-country networks, and other relevant experience.

:(1) Saving and enhancing lives through better health is a moral imperative that reflects fundamental humanitarian values.
:(2) Strategic investments in global health can spur progress in economic development, job creation, education, agricultural development, gender equity and political stability.
:(3) Because disease knows no national bounds and can breed hopelessness and despair, support for global health bolsters United States national security. Such support also builds constructive partnerships with other governments, with multilateral institutions, between public and private enterprises, and from people to people.
:(4) United States global health programs should prioritize the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the world’s population, including women, newborns and children, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities, and should be designed with their participation wherever possible.
:(5) Research and innovation play a critical role in achieving health objectives worldwide, fostering the development and introduction of new and improved health products and practices and contributing to better policies.
:(6) For maximum effectiveness, global health programs must be closely integrated with efforts to advance nutrition, improve hygiene, and expand access to clean water, sanitation, and housing.
:(7) To make health investments sustainable over the long term, the United States should help build the capacity of—
::(A) governments of partner countries to plan and budget responsibly, allocate and disburse funds equitably, and provide reliable and cost-effective health care; and
::(B) civil society to participate in decisionmaking, carry out activities and monitor service delivery.
:(8) In order to provide for sustainable financing of health care, developing countries must create strong economies and stable tax bases.
:(9) By setting clear goals and targets and identifying appropriate resources, a comprehensive, multiyear global health strategy can help to ensure policy focus and consistency, promote program integration, strengthen transparency and accountability, build congressional and public support, and accelerate results.
:(10) Multilateral approaches offer a vital and necessary complement to bilateral programs.

====C Family planning and reproductive health– ====



====Sec. 1331. Assistance for family planning and reproductive health====



=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) reproductive health care is essential to reducing poverty, improving living standards and protecting human dignity;
:(2) throughout much of the world, the lack of access by women, particularly poor women, to reproductive health care contributes to death and suffering, limits women’s ability to make decisions that affect their lives, and undermines the efforts of families to lift themselves out of poverty;
:(3) access to reproductive health care, including voluntary family planning, has a direct and important impact on child mortality, especially infant mortality;
:(4) closely spaced and ill-timed pregnancies and births contribute to high infant mortality rates, and when mothers die as a result of giving birth, their surviving infants have a greater risk of mortality and poor health status;
:(5) in many developing countries where there are few hospitals, few doctors, and poor transportation systems, and where women are not highly valued, complications of labor often result in death of the mother;
:(6) lack of availability of emergency obstetric care, along with delays in seeking medical attention, in reaching a medical facility, and in receiving medical care once arriving at a facility, contribute to the development of obstetric fistula, increasing the risk of death for both mother and child;
:(7) voluntary family planning allows women and couples to freely choose the number, timing and spacing of pregnancies, giving families and individuals greater control over their lives;
:(8) young people are particularly at risk of engaging in unsafe sexual practices, and should be provided with clear and evidence-based information to help them make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and human rights, including their right to be free from all forms of violence, coercion and discrimination;
:(9) practices such as child marriage and female genital cutting can harm the health of young people and deprive them of their dignity and human rights. Reproductive health care can play an important role in educating people about the dangers of these practices, and is often the entry point for identification of gender-based violence and sexual abuse;
:(10) integrating reproductive health care, including voluntary family planning, with HIV prevention programs is critical to combating HIV/AIDS, and can assist in decreasing the stigma associated with a seropositive HIV status;
:(11) integration of reproductive health care with other health-care and related social services increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the health system and meets people’s needs for accessible, acceptable, convenient, client-centered care;
:(12) international goals and targets for reducing poverty and improving maternal health require a significant investment in family planning and reproductive health care;
:(13) international partnerships are required to provide adequate financing for family planning and reproductive health care;
:(14) cooperating with multilateral and bilateral donors and the private sector can make commodities such as antiretrovirals, maternal health equipment, and contraceptive supplies more accessible for hard-to-reach populations; and
:(15) by investing in reproductive health care, including voluntary family planning, the United States can improve maternal and child health, lower HIV infection rates, reduce poverty and hunger, advance girls’ education, promote gender equality, broaden civic participation in the development process, and slow the depletion of natural resources.

====4 Expanding quality education– ====



====Sec. 1401. Findings and statement of policy====



=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Education is a basic human right, indispensable for human capacity development and poverty eradication.
:(2) Basic education is fundamental to development. No country has reached sustained economic growth without achieving near universal primary education.
:(3) Quality education reduces poverty and inequity, lays the foundation for sound governance, civic participation, and strong institutions, and equips people with the knowledge, skills, and self-reliance they need to increase income and expand opportunities for employment.
:(4) While developing countries bear the ultimate responsibility for educating their children, the United States and others donors can and should do more to help developing countries address their education needs.
:(5) Investing in girls’ education delivers substantial returns not only in educational attainment but also in increasing women’s and household incomes, delaying the start of sexual activity, reducing infant mortality, increasing women’s political participation, spurring economic growth, and delaying marriage.
:(6) Lack of access to adequate housing, safe drinking water close to home, and to private latrines near home and at school significantly impact girls’ attendance and retention at school.
:(7) Education can help to protect children in conflict situations from physical harm, exploitation, and sexual abuse, as well as to avoid the recruitment of children into armed groups and gangs.
:(8) The large number of children who are not enrolled in school or who receive a poor quality education not only results in a loss of human potential, but undermines stability and progress within communities and across nations.
:(9) Expanded access to primary and secondary education will increase the need for qualified teachers, and the demand for quality colleges and universities.
:(10) Exchange programs which bring citizens of developing countries to the United States for training, while helpful in expanding individual opportunities for growth, will not by themselves reach enough students and scholars to have a transformational effect on the economies and human resources of developing countries.
:(11) Partnerships between educational institutions in the United States and developing countries are an important means for sharing knowledge, experience and lessons learned for the benefit of all students.
:(12) Resources to expand global education will be most effective and efficient if they are transparent, increase coordination among governments, private sector and civil society, support national plans and hold all stakeholders accountable.

====5 Protecting and restoring the natural environment– ====



====Sec. 1501. Findings and statement of policy====



=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Sound natural resource management, healthy levels of species diversity, and functioning natural ecosystems are vital to sustainably reducing poverty in developing countries.
:(2) Natural ecosystems, when properly managed, provide economic value to local communities in the form of water, food, medicine, energy, household products, tourism and trade, as well as contributing to the global common good.
:(3) Nature provides important services for human well-being. For example, forests, floodplains, and wetlands are a natural bulwark against catastrophic flooding and severe drought, and coral reefs and mangroves reduce the impact of large storms on coastal populations, thereby reducing damages from extreme weather and the need for disaster assistance.
:(4) Natural ecosystems serve as a buffer between wildlife and human populations, minimizing the transmission of highly infectious diseases from animals to people.
:(5) Many of the most commonly prescribed medicines in the United States are derived directly from natural compounds or patterned after them. The preservation of natural areas and wild species offers the world a rich source of potential cures and treatments for disease and pain.
:(6) The survival of many animal and plant species is endangered by poaching and excessive harvesting, by the presence of toxic chemicals in water, air and soil, and by the destruction of habitats.
:(7) Degradation of land and water resources impedes efforts to improve agricultural productivity, which will be critical to feeding the world’s growing population and is a key engine of economic growth in developing countries.
:(8) The construction of dams and expansion in biofuel production in developing countries without the necessary environmental safeguards or consultation with the local populations threatens the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide for purifying, storing, and delivering water.
:(9) The continuing and accelerating alteration, destruction, and loss of forests and other natural habitats in developing countries can result in—
::(A) shortages of fuel;
::(B) loss of biologically productive wetlands;
::(C) siltation of lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation systems;
::(D) floods, soil erosion and landslides;
::(E) decimation and dislocation of indigenous peoples;
::(F) extinction of plant and animal species;
::(G) reduced capacity for food production;
::(H) loss of genetic resources;
::(I) desertification;
::(J) increased greenhouse gas emissions; and
::(K) destabilization of the earth’s climate.
:(10) Women often are especially vulnerable to the impact of natural resource degradation and climate change because they produce most of the food and collect most of the water and firewood in many countries.
:(11) Mismanagement and unregulated exploitation of natural resources has fueled conflict and corruption in many developing countries.
:(12) Illicit trade in natural resources not only robs poor countries of valuable economic and environmental resources, but often perpetrates political instability and human rights abuses, including sexual violence and the use of children as soldiers, bonded labor and sex slaves.
:(13) Illegal logging, fishing, and mining in developing countries flood the international market with low-cost products that undercut the competitiveness of responsible companies in the United States.
:(14) Economic growth generally raises energy consumption, and often results in increased emissions of greenhouse gases as well as greater pollution of air, land, and water.
:(15) If current trends in the degradation of natural resources in developing countries continue, they will severely undermine the best efforts to meet basic human needs, to achieve sustained economic growth, and to prevent international tension and conflict.
:(16) Animals, including livestock, companion animals, and wildlife, are important to human economic, environmental, and social development as well as to human quality of life. Animals and the people who depend upon them in developing countries will be particularly vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters unless adaptation and mitigation measures are utilized.
:(17) The world faces enormous, urgent, and complex challenges in conserving and protecting natural resources while fostering economic development, requiring extensive and sustained cooperation between the United States, developing countries and the international community as a whole.

====6 Improving access to safe water, sanitation, and housing– ====



====Sec. 1601. Findings and statement of policy====



=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Clean water and sanitation are among the most powerful drivers for human development. They extend opportunity, enhance dignity, and help create a virtuous cycle of improving health and rising wealth.
:(2) Unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and unsuitable and unhygienic living conditions exact an enormous toll on human health in developing countries, particularly for infants and children.
:(3) Diseases linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation, as well as the time and energy women often devote to collecting water, significantly reduce economic productivity in less developed countries and promote lifecycles of disadvantage.
:(4) Water scarcity has negative consequences for agricultural productivity and food security, and seriously threatens international ability to increase food production at the rate required to meet the needs of the world’s growing population.
:(5) The underlying cause of water scarcity in the large majority of cases is institutional and political, and requires sustainable and effective water resource management.
:(6) Demand for water resources has contributed to armed conflict in many parts of the world, while conflict and civil strife often reduce access to clean water and sanitation for displaced persons and other innocent victims.
:(7) The continued degradation of watersheds threatens the benefits that healthy natural systems provide, and on which people rely.
:(8) The effects of climate change are expected to produce severe consequences for water availability and resource management in many developing countries, which could result in severe and chronic water shortages.
:(9) Unsuitable and unhygienic living conditions can exact a heavy toll on human health and productivity. Adequate housing is often a precondition for the enjoyment of various civic and human rights, including the rights to work, vote, obtain education, receive health care, and access other social services.
:(10) Rapid urbanization and future population growth are expected to exacerbate already limited access to water, as well as to adequate housing.
:(11) Approximately half the world’s population lives in cities, often in slums characterized by unsafe water, poor sanitation, lack of basic services, overcrowding, inferior construction and insecure tenure. Because slum populations are growing rapidly, they require increased attention and better integrated programming.
:(12) Inadequate laws, policies and enforcement mechanisms to protect real property use, lease, and ownership rights often subject slum dwellers to arbitrary, often supra-market rents, forced evictions, threats, and harassment.
:(13) Insecurity of tenure severely inhibits economic development by undermining investment incentives and constraining the growth of credit markets, imperils the ability of families to achieve sustainable livelihoods and assured access to housing, and often contributes to conflict over property rights.
:(14) Women are affected disproportionately by forced evictions and insecure tenure as a result of gender discrimination, often including gender-biased laws that define women as legal minors or otherwise prevent them from owning or leasing land, property, and housing, making them more vulnerable to poverty, violence, and sexual abuse.
:(15) Expanding access to clean water, sanitation, and housing is essential for reducing the global burden of disease, advancing economic and social development, protecting basic human rights, and mitigating sources of conflict.

=====(b) Statement of policy– =====

=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Women and girls are the majority of the world’s poor, unschooled, unhealthy, and underfed.
:(2) Women around the world often work under substandard conditions, for longer hours, and with lower compensation, less income stability and fewer economic opportunities than men.
:(3) Women are often excluded by law or practice from participating fully and equally in the political, economic, and social life of their country.
:(4) Women own significantly less land than men and experience numerous barriers to ownership. Access to land and property rights offers women greater economic opportunity and security, greater protection from physical harm, better access to health, education, and financial services, and improved social status.
:(5) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls in humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, and natural disasters are at extreme risk of violence, exploitation and intimidation.
:(6) Violence against women dramatically impedes progress in meeting global health goals, including efforts to reduce maternal mortality and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS.
:(7) Ensuring that women have the ability to effectively plan families is one of the keys to expanding their economic opportunities. Yet hundreds of millions of women lack access to affordable, effective, and appropriate contraceptive methods and reproductive health care, putting them at greater risk of unintended pregnancies and serious health complications.
:(8) Studies have shown that investments in women and girls have broad multiplier effects, particularly in the areas of health and education, which over the long run can significantly improve the future of communities and countries.
:(9) Investments in women and girls can play a key role in reducing poverty, countering violent extremism, promoting stability, fostering tolerance and reconciliation, and building strong and vibrant civil societies.
:(10) Increasing women’s access to economic opportunities is crucial to preventing and responding to domestic and sexual violence.
:(11) Fostering gender equality requires strengthening rules, practices, and institutions that protect the rights of women and men, girls and boys, as well as including them in the design, implementation, and monitoring of programs to reduce poverty and alleviate human suffering.

=====(b) Statement of policy– =====

It is the policy of the United States to—

====Sec. 1706. Prevention of child marriage====



=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Child marriage, also known as “forced marriage” or “early marriage” , is a harmful traditional practice that deprives girls of their dignity and human rights.
:(2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, “Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of intending spouses” .
:(3) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage, the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.
:(4) Child marriage has negative effects on the health of girls, including significantly increased risk of maternal death and morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.
:(5) Most countries with high rates of child marriage have a legally established minimum age of marriage, yet child marriage persists due to strong traditional norms and the failure to enforce existing laws.

====8 Strengthening democratic governance– ====



====Sec. 1801. Findings and statement of policy====



=====(a) Findings– =====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Democratic development, political pluralism, and respect for internationally recognized human rights are intrinsically linked to economic and social progress. Efforts to reduce poverty and promote broad-based economic growth are more effective and sustainable in a political environment in which fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are respected, government institutions are broadly representative, and corruption is held to a minimum.
:(2) Violent extremism that threatens United States national security flourishes where democratic governance is weak, justice uncertain, and legal avenues for change in short supply.
:(3) Democracy can only be sustained in a society in which the legitimacy of the government rests firmly on the expressed consent of the governed; the rights of all citizens, including minorities, are respected and protected; and there is effective civilian control over the military and security forces.
:(4) There is a growing worldwide movement toward more open, just and democratic societies. This trend is essential to achieving the United States ultimate objective of worldwide respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction as to race, sex, language, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity. At the same time, this trend holds great promise for promoting the peace of the world and the foreign policy, security, and general welfare of the United States.
:(5) Preventing mass atrocities is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States. Governmental engagement on atrocities too often arrives too late, when opportunities for prevention or low-cost, low-risk action have been missed. By helping partner countries to strengthen democratic institutions and practices and to manage diversity peacefully, responsibly and equitably, [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] can address many of the structural conditions that give rise to mass atrocities.
:(6) Persons belonging to racial, ethnic, religious, and linguistic minorities, as well as lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender individuals, and persons with disabilities are often subjected to discrimination, harassment, exploitation, intimidation, and exclusion. United States policies and programs should seek to foster equal opportunity and equal access to justice for all people, including marginalized groups.
:(7) Civil society organizations and activists worldwide contribute in unique and essential ways to development as innovative agents of change and social transformation. In particular, such organizations have an important role to play in bringing the voices of the poor to influence government policies, and to hold governments and other powerful actors to account for their actions. A diverse, strong, and independent civil society sector is critical for the sustainable reduction of poverty.
:(8) Democracy cannot be imposed from without. However, the United States should encourage all states to meet their obligations under international law to uphold and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and should support the aspirations of those who seek through peaceful means to make their governments more democratic and accountable.
:(9) Democracy takes time to become firmly rooted in society and in the political system. While short-term interventions can be important and effective means for preventing abuses and opening windows of opportunity, democratic development generally requires sustained effort and a comprehensive approach.

=====(b) Statement of policy– =====

It is the policy of the United States to—
:(1) support democratic aspirations and values, foster the spread of democratic institutions, and encourage universal respect for internationally recognized human rights, including civil and political liberties;
:(2) recognize that, to be successful, such support must not be defined narrowly in terms of parties and elections and government institutional capacity building, but must include other, equally important, aspects of democratic development, including—
::(A) independent and balanced media;
::(B) impartial and competent judicial processes that deliver access to justice;
::(C) respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and
::(D) a vibrant civil society that engages meaningfully with government; and
:(3) take into consideration a country’s commitment to good governance, respect for the rule of law and protection of internationally recognized human rights in providing assistance under this subtitle.

===B Alleviating human suffering– ===



===Sec. 1901. Findings and statement of policy===



====(a) Findings– ====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Natural disasters can temporarily overwhelm the capacity of countries, regardless of wealth and technological advancement, to meet basic human needs and protect people from harm. Such disasters are likely to increase in number and severity along with the changes in the world’s climate, the degradation of the environment, and the expansion of the world’s population.
:(2) Conflict, weak and poor governance, corruption, and repression increase vulnerability to humanitarian crisis, aggravate the impact of physical and environmental shocks, complicate the ability to respond effectively, and lengthen the recovery period.
:(3) Conflicts, human rights violations, and natural disasters often uproot people within their own countries. Forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods, and without access to the rights and resources available to those who cross an international border, these internally displaced persons are among the world’s most vulnerable and neglected people.
:(4) Persons affected by conflict are at greatly heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence. Such risk can be mitigated through proper design and implementation of humanitarian programs, especially those relating to water and sanitation, health, shelter, food, education, energy, and livelihoods, as well as through specific protection measures.
:(5) In protracted crises, humanitarian resources are often exhausted before the essential conditions are in place for long-term, sustainable development. In addition, lack of expertise and training, inadequate coordination, and unclear or narrow mandates often leave programming gaps. Coordinated action is required to address basic human needs at every stage of the transition, from emergency relief to recovery, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and development.
:(6) Continuity of educational activities for all children is an essential humanitarian need. Assistance to countries affected by conflict or crisis should include formal and informal education services to ensure that children are able to continue their schooling and are protected from physical harm, psychological and social distress, recruitment into armed groups, family separation, and abuses related to their displacement.
:(7) Nongovernmental organizations play a leading role in humanitarian action, not only by delivering relief in underserved areas, but also by contributing a significant proportion of the international resources, by developing effective and innovative techniques and methodologies, by maintaining long-term relationships of trust with affected communities, by establishing reputations for independence, impartiality and neutrality, by integrating knowledge and expertise about local languages, customs, conditions, and needs, by bridging the gaps between relief and development, and by advocating for those in greatest need.
:(8) The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] plays a central, unique, and vital role in leading and coordinating international humanitarian assistance. Its organs and affiliated agencies have capabilities and expertise that far exceed the ability of any single donor to respond to humanitarian needs. The collective voice of these partners frequently enhances United States bilateral efforts and often plays a useful role in gaining access and achieving results where United States influence might otherwise be limited.
:(9) Multilateralism allows the United States to leverage its humanitarian contributions as part of a wider international donor effort and helps ensure that United States efforts complement those of other donors. To be effective, United States engagement with multilateral humanitarian organizations requires predictable funding and strong diplomatic engagement in policy development and institutional management.

====(b) Statement of policy– ====

It is the policy of the United States to save lives, alleviate human suffering wherever possible, and protect vulnerable populations, taking action solely on the basis of need, without discrimination between or within affected populations, without regard to diplomatic, economic, military, or other objectives of the United States, and without favoring any side in an armed conflict or other dispute.

===Sec. 1902. Goal and objectives===



====(a) Goal– ====

The goal of assistance under this subtitle is to save lives, alleviate suffering, maintain human dignity, and protect and uphold the rights of extremely vulnerable people.

====(b) Objectives– ====

In furtherance of the goal of subsection (a), assistance under this subtitle shall be designed to achieve the following objectives:
:(1) Provide quick and effective relief in the aftermath of disasters, whether natural or human-caused.
:(2) Facilitate the transition to self-sufficiency and safe lives and livelihoods.
:(3) Protect civilians affected by conflict, disaster, and displacement from physical harm, persecution, exploitation, abuse, malnutrition and disease, family separation, gender-based violence, forcible recruitment and other threats to human rights.
:(4) Build capacity to prevent and mitigate the effects of conflict, disasters, and displacement.

===Sec. 1903. Humanitarian principles===



====(a) In general– ====

United States humanitarian action shall be carried out in accordance with the following principles:
:(1) The central purpose of humanitarian action is to save lives, alleviate human suffering, and protect vulnerable population wherever possible.
:(2) Humanitarian action should be impartial, based solely on and in proportion to need, without discrimination between or within affected populations, and without regard to the political views, national origin, or religious affiliation of the beneficiaries.
:(3) Humanitarian action should be neutral, without furthering a political or religious agenda or favoring any side in an armed conflict or other dispute where such humanitarian action is carried out.
:(4) Humanitarian action should be independent, without regard to the political, economic, military, or other objectives that any actor may hold in relation to the affected areas and populations.
:(5) Humanitarian action should be undertaken in accordance with international human rights law, international humanitarian law, refugee law, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.
:(6) Humanitarian action should meet international standards, using the SPHERE Minimum Standards for Disaster Response and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee guidelines as benchmarks, should be informed by the INEE Minimum Standards, and should promote the principles and practices of Good Humanitarian Donorship.
:(7) Protection of civilians affected by conflict, disaster, and displacement from physical harm, persecution, exploitation, abuse, malnutrition and disease, family separation, sexual and gender-based violence, forcible recruitment, and other threats to human rights is a core element of humanitarian action.
:(8) Humanitarian action should be primarily civilian in nature. The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] should provide humanitarian assistance overseas only as a last resort when there is no comparable civilian alternative and when the use of military or civil defense assets can uniquely meet a critical humanitarian need.
:(9) When the military is required to support a humanitarian response, its participation should be subject to the overall leadership, coordination and policy guidance of civilian agencies, who must be provided the requisite resources and authorities to perform this leadership role.
:(10) The United States should adopt, between the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] and [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] , a lead-agency approach with a clear division of leadership and responsibility for humanitarian response. Under the guidance of the President, the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary]] should lead for operations responding to political and security crises, while the Administrator should lead for operations in response to humanitarian crises resulting from large-scale natural or industrial disasters, famines, disease outbreaks, and other natural phenomena.
:(11) Humanitarian action should be undertaken in a timely, flexible, and efficient manner on the basis of assessed needs.
:(12) In addition to providing funding for relief efforts, the United States should use its leverage to assist humanitarian agencies in obtaining secure, unfettered access to survivors in crisis situations.
:(13) To ensure impartiality, neutrality, independence, and the appearance thereof, humanitarian action should be implemented by intergovernmental and nongovernmental international humanitarian organizations, in partnership with local communities, indigenous organizations, and affected governments whenever possible.
:(14) Individuals affected by conflict, disaster, persecution, and displacement have the greatest stake in the performance of humanitarian programs and should, to the greatest possible extent, be involved in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of such programs.
:(15) Humanitarian, reconstruction, and development programs should be coordinated, planned, and funded to ensure continuity of life-sustaining services during transition phases.
:(16) Humanitarian, development, and other economic assistance programs should be designed with an eye toward reducing the risk and impact of future conflict and crisis and building resiliency among the most vulnerable populations.
:(17) United States humanitarian action should strive to ensure that refugees, internally displaced persons, and other conflict-affected individuals and communities are treated equally in the application of policy and the allocation of resources.
:(18) To promote learning, accountability, transparency, and the efficient use of resources, the United States should support independent monitoring and evaluation of all humanitarian assistance.

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Peacebuilding involves the full range of approaches, processes, and stages of transforming violent conflict into stable, peaceful relationships.

:(3) United States peacebuilding efforts are most effective when they are undertaken in cooperation with the international community, and when they build local capacity to prevent and stop violence and mass atrocities.
:(4) In the event that prevention fails, the United States has an obligation to work both multilaterally and bilaterally to mobilize diplomatic, humanitarian, financial, and when necessary and appropriate, military resources to save lives and protect civilian populations.
:(5) Civil society organizations, including international nongovernmental organizations and local community groups, play an important role in promoting nonviolent conflict resolution, fostering harmony among religions, ethnic groups, communities, and factions, and facilitating second-track diplomacy. By coordinating with and working through such organizations, the United States can strengthen the effectiveness of its peacebuilding programs.

:(3) All defense articles provided by the United States to countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region will be used only in accordance with the requirements of this Act and the agreements under which those defense articles were provided.
:(4) The United States will provide security assistance for Greece and Turkey only when providing that assistance is intended solely for defensive purposes, including when necessary to enable the recipient country to fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the [[w:NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] , and shall be designed to ensure that the present balance of military strength among countries of the region, including between Greece and Turkey, is preserved. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of defense articles to Greece or Turkey for legitimate self defense or to enable Greece or Turkey to fulfill their [[w:NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] obligations.
:(5) The United States shall use its influence to ensure the continuation of the ceasefire on Cyprus until an equitable negotiated settlement is reached.
:(6) The United States shall use its influence to achieve the withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus in the context of a solution to the Cyprus problem.

====(b) Quarterly report– ====

===Sec. 2031. Atrocities Prevention Board===



====(a) Findings– ====

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) Non-combatants comprise most of the casualties in modern conflict.
:(2) In many cases, civilian deaths are the result of belligerents deliberately targeting civilians on a wide scale.
:(3) Civilians are vulnerable both during interstate conflict and intrastate situations, such as civil wars, insurgencies, and anarchic conditions associated with failed states.
:(4) There are common variables to situations giving rise to atrocities, including past history of such occurrences, persistence of articulated and non-articulated tensions, and poor or malevolent leadership.
:(5) Most tellingly, atrocities—including genocide—often occur when displaced persons attempt to flee conflict.
:(6) The United States is committed to working with our allies, and to strengthening our own internal capabilities, in order to ensure that the United States and the international community are proactively engaged in a strategic effort to prevent mass atrocities and genocide. In the event that prevention fails, the United States will work both multilaterally and bilaterally to mobilize diplomatic, humanitarian, financial, and—in certain instances—military means to prevent and respond to genocide and mass atrocities.
:(7) Preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States.
:(8) United States security is affected when masses of civilians are slaughtered, refugees flow across borders, and murderers wreak havoc on regional stability and livelihoods.
:(9) Governmental engagement on atrocities and genocide too often arrives too late, when opportunities for prevention or low-cost, low-risk action have been missed.
:(10) Ensuring that a full range of options is available to senior policy makers requires a level of governmental organization that matches the methodical organization characteristic of mass killings.

====(b) Establishment of Interagency Atrocities Prevention Board– ====

The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] shall establish an [[w:|Interagency Atrocities Prevention Board]] (in this section referred to as the “Board” ) with the following responsibilities:

:(3) Conduct gaming and contingency planning exercises regarding atrocities prevention and response.
:(4) Oversee the development and implementation of comprehensive atrocities prevention and response strategies.
:(5) Identify available resources and policy options necessary to prevent the emergence or escalation of mass atrocities, including—
::(A) foreign assistance;
::(B) diplomatic initiatives;
::(C) deployment of civilian expertise;
::(D) use of sanctions; and
::(E) military options.
:(6) Identify and close gaps in expertise, readiness, and planning for atrocities prevention and early action across Federal agencies.
:(7) Ensure that risk assessments and policies to mitigate identified risks are communicated in a timely fashion to the relevant Federal agencies and integrated into activities.

==Title IV— Building and reinforcing strategic partnerships==



==Sec. 4001. Findings==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The ultimate goal of the United States continues to be a world which is free from the scourge of war and the dangers and burdens of armaments, in which the use of force has been subordinated to the rule of law, and in which international adjustments to a changing world are achieved peacefully.
:(2) In furtherance of that goal, it remains the policy of the United States to encourage regional arms control and disarmament agreements; discourage arms races; and encourage restraint in the provision of armaments, especially small arms and light weapons and advanced conventional weapons, to countries in regions of instability.
:(3) The efforts of the United States and other friendly countries to promote peace and security continue to require measures of support based upon the principle of effective self-help and mutual aid.
:(4) The peace of the world and the security of the United States are endangered so long as hostile countries continue by threat of military action, by the use of economic pressure, by their active or permissive support of terrorists, terrorist organizations and extremism, and by internal subversion, or other means to attempt to undermine the peace, security, human rights, political freedoms, civil rights, or prosperity of others.
:(5) Peace and security for all is endangered by the failure of countries to live up to their sovereign responsibilities to protect civilian populations from violence, reduce terrorism, halt the spread of dangerous materials, and control transnational crime.
:(6) It is in the interest of the United States to help foreign countries build capable and accountable military, police, customs, and other security forces, under civilian democratic control, in order to exercise their sovereign responsibilities.
:(7) Extreme poverty and underdevelopment are threats to peace. The provision of foreign assistance under this title to developing countries must take into account how the foreign assistance will affect such countries’ social and economic development and whether the foreign assistance is diverting resources away from development efforts that meet basic needs of the population and address root causes of instability.
:(8) Weapons and weapons systems are not and should not be considered to be normal commodities for international trade, and the United States should permit such sales only to the extent that such sales directly support United States foreign policy and national security objectives.
:(9) Foreign assistance under this title should not be provided if such foreign assistance will likely—
::(A) contribute to an arms race or regional instability;
::(B) increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, either within or across the borders of the recipient country;
::(C) support international terrorism;
::(D) prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral arms control arrangements;
::(E) adversely affect the arms control or nonproliferation policy of the United States;

::(G) undermine the objectives and purposes to promote and protect human rights and democracy under title III.

==Sec. 4002. Statement of policy==

It is the policy of the United States—
:(1) to promote the peace of the world and the foreign policy, security, and general welfare of the United States by fostering an improved climate of security, political independence and individual liberty, improving the ability of friendly countries and international organizations to deter or, if necessary, defeat aggression in whatever form, facilitating arrangements for individual and collective security, assisting friendly countries to provide for their legitimate defense needs, and creating an environment of security and stability in the developing friendly countries essential to their more rapid social, economic, and political progress;
:(2) to exert leadership in the world community to bring about arrangements for reducing the international trade in implements of war and to lessen the danger of outbreak of regional conflict and the burdens of armaments;
:(3) to exert maximum efforts to achieve universal control of weapons of mass destruction, the securing and control of the means to produce and deliver them, and universal regulation and reduction of armaments, including armed forces, under adequate safeguards to protect complying countries against violation, aggression, and invasion;
:(4) to administer United States programs for or procedures governing the export, sale, and grant of defense articles and defense services to foreign countries and international organizations in a manner consistent with the goals described in section 4003;
:(5) to achieve international peace and security through the United Nations and the diplomatic settlement of disputes so that armed force shall not be used except for individual or collective self-defense;
:(6) to encourage all other countries to join in a common undertaking to meet the goals described in section 4003; and

:(3) United States leadership is essential to countering terrorism and violent extremism, fostering political and economic stability, and reaching comprehensive, just and lasting peace agreements.
:(4) To reduce the need for military force, the United States must develop and maintain a broad range of efficient and effective diplomatic and economic tools to promote peaceful resolution of conflict and to prevent the collapse of weak and fragile states.

:(6) Prudent investment of United States resources to assist, through bilateral and collective efforts, in preventing or containing armed conflict, in restoring peace and stability, and in addressing the sources of conflict, is essential for achieving a peaceful world.

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Fostering economic growth is essential to sustaining the impact of United States development assistance.
