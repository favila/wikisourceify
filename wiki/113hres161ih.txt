{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Food and Drug Administration should encourage the use of abuse-deterrent formulations of drugs.    Whereas when abuse-deterrent formulations of a drug have been developed, approved, and recognized as effective by the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration,]]the approval and marketing of generic versions that do not have abuse-deterrent features are likely to prevent achievement of the public health purposes of the efforts to develop such abuse-deterrent formulations;   Whereas the [[w:Office of National Drug Control Policy|Office of National Drug Control Policy]]and the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]have for many years strongly encouraged manufacturers of opioid drug products to develop abuse-deterrent formulations designed to prevent or discourage the abuse or misuse of those products;   Whereas in response, several opioid drug manufacturers have developed abuse-deterrent formulations;   Whereas helping to reduce the level of abuse of opioid drug products is dependent on the widespread adoption of new technologies and approaches to the safer formulation of these drugs;   Whereas the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Commissioner of Food and Drugs]]has acknowledged that the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]has the authority under current law to require generic versions of products that have been formulated or reformulated with abuse-deterrent features to have comparable features; and   Whereas fourteen Members of Congress in a bipartisan coalition have cosponsored the Stop Tampering with Prescription Pills (STOPP) Act , which would similarly promote abuse-deterrent technologies in addictive painkillers: Now, therefore, be it

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]that the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]]should exercise its acknowledged authority toâ€”
:(1) refuse to approve generic versions of non-abuse-deterrent opioid products that have been replaced in the market with abuse-deterrent formulations; and
:(2) require generic versions of abuse-deterrent opioid products to be formulated with comparable abuse-deterrent features.
