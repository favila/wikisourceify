{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend section 9A of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require that local school wellness policies include a requirement that students receive 50 hours of school nutrition education per school year.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Nutrition Education Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1)  Section 9A of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1758b 42 U.S.C. 1758b] )requires all local educational agencies participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1751 42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.] )or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1771 42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.] )to establish a local school wellness policy for schools under the jurisdiction of local educational agency that include nutrition promotion and education. However, there are no specific requirements regarding the amount of time or type of classes that school children have to spend or take in nutrition education.
:(2) Some schools include in their health education classes some general information about nutrition, but there are no specific guidelines of what the minimum requirements should be. The mean number of hours spent on nutrition education in the first 4 years of school is only 13 hours per year. A minimum of 50 hours per year are thought to be necessary to influence behavior.
:(3) Each local educational agency participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1751 42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.] )or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1771 42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.] )should have a minimum requirement for amount of time per year students should spend on nutrition education and the type of instruction that should be provided as part of such education.
