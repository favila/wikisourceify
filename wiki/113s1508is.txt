==(a) Program– ==

The [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] shall establish and implement a program, to be known as the Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program , under which the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] shall award grants for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to owners or operators of water systems for the purpose of increasing the resiliency or adaptability of the water systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes (based on the best available research and data) to the hydrologic conditions of a region of the United States.

==(b) Use of funds– ==

As a condition on receipt of a grant under this Act, an owner or operator of a water system shall agree to use the grant funds exclusively to assist in the planning, design, construction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or project that meets the purpose described in subsection (a)by—
:(1) conserving water or enhancing water use efficiency, including through the use of water metering and electronic sensing and control systems to measure the effectiveness of a water efficiency program;
:(2) modifying or relocating existing water system infrastructure made or projected to be significantly impaired by changing hydrologic conditions;
:(3) preserving or improving water quality, including through measures to manage, reduce, treat, or reuse municipal stormwater, wastewater, or drinking water;
:(4) investigating, designing, or constructing groundwater remediation, recycled water, or desalination facilities or systems to serve existing communities;
:(5) enhancing water management by increasing watershed preservation and protection, such as through the use of natural or engineered green infrastructure in the management, conveyance, or treatment of water, wastewater, or stormwater;
:(6) enhancing energy efficiency or the use and generation of renewable energy in the management, conveyance, or treatment of water, wastewater, or stormwater;
:(7) supporting the adoption and use of advanced water treatment, water supply management (such as reservoir reoperation and water banking), or water demand management technologies, projects, or processes (such as water reuse and recycling, adaptive conservation pricing, and groundwater banking) that maintain or increase water supply or improve water quality;
:(8) modifying or replacing existing systems or constructing new systems for existing communities or land that is being used for agricultural production to improve water supply, reliability, storage, or conveyance in a manner that—
::(A) promotes conservation or improves the efficiency of use of available water supplies; and
::(B) does not further exacerbate stresses on ecosystems or cause redirected impacts by degrading water quality or increasing net greenhouse gas emissions;
:(9) supporting practices and projects, such as improved irrigation systems, water banking and other forms of water transactions, groundwater recharge, stormwater capture, groundwater conjunctive use, and reuse or recycling of drainage water, to improve water quality or promote more efficient water use on land that is being used for agricultural production;
:(10) reducing flood damage, risk, and vulnerability by—
::(A) restoring floodplains, wetland, and upland integral to flood management, protection, prevention, and response;
::(B) modifying levees, floodwalls, and other structures through setbacks, notches, gates, removal, or similar means to facilitate reconnection of rivers to floodplains, reduce flood stage height, and reduce damage to properties and populations;
::(C) providing for acquisition and easement of flood-prone land and properties in order to reduce damage to property and risk to populations; or
::(D) promoting land use planning that prevents future floodplain development;
:(11) conducting and completing studies or assessments to project how changing hydrologic conditions may impact the future operations and sustainability of water systems; or
:(12) developing and implementing measures to increase the resilience of water systems and regional and hydrological basins, including the Colorado River Basin, to rapid hydrologic change or a natural disaster (such as tsunami, earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption).

==(c) Application– ==

To seek a grant under this Act, the owner or operator of a water system shall submit to the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] an application that—
:(1) includes a proposal for the program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement to be planned, designed, constructed, implemented, or maintained by the water system;
:(2) provides the best available research or data that demonstrate—
::(A) the risk to the water resources or infrastructure of the water system as a result of ongoing or forecasted changes to the hydrologic system of a region, including rising sea levels and changes in precipitation patterns; and
::(B) the manner in which the proposed program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement would perform under the anticipated hydrologic conditions;
:(3) describes the manner in which the proposed program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement is expected—
::(A) to enhance the resiliency of the water system, including source water protection for community water systems, to the anticipated hydrologic conditions; or
