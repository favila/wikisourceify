{{Center|A BILL}}

To authorize further assistance to Israel for the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Iron Dome Support Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The State of Israel remains under grave threat and frequent attack from missiles, rockets, and mortar shells fired at Israeli civilian targets by militants from the Foreign Terrorist Organization Hamas on its southern border and by the Foreign Terrorist Organization Hezbollah on its northern border, which have killed, wounded, or inflicted psychological trauma on countless Israelis.
:(2) The United States remains committed to Israel’s qualitative military edge, including its advantage over non-state actors such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which boast increasingly sophisticated and powerful weapons as a result of support from Iran, Syria, and other state actors.
:(3) The Israeli Defense Forces report that the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system has achieved a success rate of more than 85 percent, intercepting rockets bound for residential neighborhoods, busy road junctions, shopping centers, and crowded streets in southern Israel.
:(4) The recent success of the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system during Operation Pillar of Defense averted massive Israeli casualties, thereby eliminating Israel’s need to conduct a ground-based attack against Gaza-based terrorists, enhancing Israel’s operational flexibility, and preventing terrorists from plunging the region into crisis whenever they choose.
:(5) The United States can help to advance its own vital national security interests and the cause of Middle Eastern peace and stability by supporting Israel’s ability to defend itself against missiles, rockets, and other threats.
:(6) Israel has indicated that it is ready to share the technology of the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system with the United States for the United States use to strengthen the United States defense capabilities.
:(7) The Government of Israel currently has five operational Iron Dome batteries deployed in the field, which are far from sufficient to protect all of Israel’s territory.

=Sec. 3. Authorization of assistance to Israel for Iron Dome anti-missile defense system=

The [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] , acting through the [[w:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] and the [[w:United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] , is authorized to provide assistance, upon request by the Government of Israel, for the procurement, maintenance, enhancement, and sustainment of the Iron Dome defense system for purposes of intercepting short-range and medium-range rockets, missiles, and projectiles launched against Israel.
