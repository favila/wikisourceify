 To require the Transportation Security Administration to implement best practices and improve transparency with regard to technology acquisition programs, and for other purposes.    

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The [[w:Transportation Security Administration|Transportation Security Administration]](in this Act referred to as“TSA”) does not consistently implement [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]policies and Government best practices for acquisition and procurement.
:(2)   [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]has not developed a multiyear technology investment plan. As a result, [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]has underutilized innovation opportunities within the private sector, including from small businesses.
:(3) Due in part to the deficiencies referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) , [[w:Transportation Security Administration|TSA]]has faced challenges in meeting key performance requirements for several major acquisitions and procurements, resulting in reduced security effectiveness and wasted expenditures.
