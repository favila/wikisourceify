This Act may be cited as the “Alice Paul Women’s Suffrage Congressional Gold Medal Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Alice Paul was born on January, 11, 1885, in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, and died on July 9, 1977.

:(3) Alice Paul and the National Woman’s Party were the first group ever to picket the White House.
:(4) While President Woodrow Wilson trumpeted America’s values of democracy abroad during World War I, Alice Paul was dedicated to reminding the President that not all Americans enjoyed democracy at home.

:(6) Alice Paul’s courage inspired thousands of women to join the women’s suffrage movement.
:(7) Instead of patiently waiting for States to grant women suffrage, Alice Paul mobilized an entire generation of women to pressure the United States Congress and the President to give all women in America the right to vote.

:(9) Alice Paul lobbied [[w:|Congress]] to include gender in civil rights bills and was successful in including sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
