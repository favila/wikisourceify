{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Celebrating the Molalla Centennial.    Whereas on August 23, 1913, after decades as a United States settlement and thousands of years as a sacred home to indigenous peoples, Molalla was incorporated as a city in the State of Oregon;   Whereas the Molalla Indians, whose descendants are members of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, first inhabited Molalla;   Whereas settlers arrived in the area in the mid-nineteenth century, before Oregon became a State;   Whereas during the 1850s, Molalla became home to schools, a post office, a general store, trade, and an active agricultural industry;   Whereas the Molalla Pioneer was established as Molalla’s first newspaper in 1913 and continues to serve Molalla today;   Whereas in 1913, Molalla celebrated the arrival of its first steam train with a rodeo, taken over in 1923 by the Molalla Buckeroo Association and now known as the Molalla Buckeroo;   Whereas people from throughout the region participate in the annual Molalla Buckeroo Rodeo and the Ross Coleman Invitational Professional Bull Riding event;   Whereas timber production, nurseries, Christmas tree production, and other agricultural industries have supported the Molalla economy for the past century; and   Whereas thousands of people each year come to Molalla to experience the Molalla River Recreation Corridor through kayaking, fishing, hunting, camping, horseback riding, and other recreational activities: Now, therefore, be it
