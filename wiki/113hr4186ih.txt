==Sec. 102. Findings==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Taxpayer-supported research investments administered by the [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]should serve the national interest.
:(2) The [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]has made major contributions for more than 50 years to strengthen and sustain the Nation’s academic research enterprise.
:(3) The economic strength and national security of the United States, and the quality of life of all Americans, are grounded in the Nation’s scientific and technological capabilities.
:(4) Providing support for basic research is an investment in our Nation’s future security and economic prosperity.
:(5) Congress applauds the [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]’s recognition that wise stewardship of taxpayer dollars is necessary to maintain and ensure the public’s trust for funding of fundamental scientific and engineering research.
:(6) Other nations are increasing their public investments in basic research in the physical sciences in order to boost long-term economic growth.
:(7) Longstanding United States leadership in supercomputing, genomics, nanoscience, photonics, quantum physics, and other key technological areas is jeopardized if United States investments in basic research in the natural sciences do not keep pace.
:(8) Redundant regulations and reporting requirements imposed by Federal agencies on research institutions and researchers increase costs by tens of millions of dollars annually.
:(9) The [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]carries out important functions by supporting basic research in all science and engineering disciplines and in supporting science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at all levels.
:(10) The research and education activities of the [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]promote the discovery, integration, dissemination, and application of new knowledge in service to society and prepare future generations of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers who will be necessary to ensure America’s leadership in the global marketplace.
:(11) The [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]should meet the highest standards of efficiency, transparency, and accountability in its stewardship of public funds.
:(12) The [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]is charged with the responsibilities—
::(A) to develop and encourage the pursuit of a national policy for the promotion of basic research and education in the sciences;
::(B) to initiate, support, and conduct basic scientific research and to appraise the impact of research on industrial development and the general welfare;
::(C) to initiate, support, and conduct scientific research activities in connection with matters relating to the national defense, at the request of the [[w:|Secretary of Defense]];
::(D) to award scholarships and graduate fellowships in the sciences;
::(E) to foster the interchange of scientific information among scientists and across scientific disciplines;
::(F) to evaluate scientific research programs undertaken by agencies of the Federal Government, and to correlate the [[w:National Science Foundation|Foundation]]’s scientific research with that undertaken by individuals and by public and private research groups;
::(G) to communicate effectively to American citizens the relevance of public investments in scientific discovery and technological innovation to the Nation’s security, prosperity, and welfare; and
::(H) to establish such special commissions as the [[w:National Science Board|Board]]considers necessary.
:(13) The emerging global economic, scientific, and technical environment challenges long standing assumptions about domestic and international policy, requiring the Foundation to play a more proactive role in sustaining the competitive advantage of the United States through superior research capabilities.
:(14) Commercial application of the results of Federal investment in basic and computing science is consistent with longstanding United States technology transfer policy for cybersecurity and other homeland security applications, because of the urgent needs of commercial, academic, and individual users, as well as the Federal and State governments.

==Sec. 201. Findings; sense of Congress==



===(a) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) According to the National Science Board’s Science and Engineering Indicators, the science and engineering workforce has shown sustained growth for more than half a century, and workers with science and engineering degrees tend to earn more than comparable workers in other fields.
:(2) According to the Program for International Student Assessment 2012 results, America lags behind many other nations in STEM education. American students rank 21st in science and 26th in mathematics.
:(3) Junior Achievement USA and ING recently found a decrease of 25 percent in the percentage of teenage students interested in STEM careers.
:(4) According to a 2007 report from the Department of Labor, industries and firms dependent on a strong science and mathematics workforce have launched a variety of programs that target K–12 students and undergraduate and graduate students in STEM fields.
:(5) The Federal Government spends nearly $3 billion annually on STEM education related program and activities, but encouraging STEM education activities beyond the scope of the Federal Government, including privately sponsored competitions and programs in our schools, is crucial to the future technical and economic competitiveness of the United States.

===(b) Sense of congress– ===

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) more effective coordination and adoption of performance measurement based on objective outcomes for federally supported STEM programs is needed;
:(2) leveraging private and nonprofit investments in STEM education will be essential to strengthening the Federal STEM portfolio;
:(3) strengthening the Federal STEM portfolio may require program consolidations and terminations, but such changes should be based on evidence with stakeholder input;
:(4) the President’s fiscal year 2014 budget proposal did not adequately explain proposed program consolidations and terminations in the Federal STEM portfolio, nor did it elicit stakeholder input and outside expertise, resulting in the need for Congress to limit the Administration’s implementation of that proposal; and
:(5) coordinating STEM programs and activities across the Federal Government in order to limit duplication and engage stakeholders in STEM programs and related activities for which objective outcomes can be measured will bolster results of Federal STEM education programs, improve the return on taxpayers’ investments in STEM education programs, and in turn strengthen the United States economy.
