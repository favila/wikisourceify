 Recognizing the need for Compton Community College to receive an expedited accreditation process.    Whereas Compton Community College lost its accreditation on August 22, 2006;   Whereas Compton Community College has since partnered with El Camino College, an accredited school of good standing, to offer accredited courses to 6,780 students;   Whereas Compton Community College and the Compton Community College District Board of Trustees, in partnership with the board, faculty, and staff at El Camino College, are dedicated to providing quality educational programs and services to the 5 Compton Community College District Trustee Area communities of Compton, Carson, Lynwood, Paramount, Watts/Willowbrook, and neighboring cities;   Whereas Compton Community College is a source of community pride, a positive stimulus for students and families, and supports the continued development of the surrounding communities;   Whereas Compton Community College has a proud history, having functioned as one of the primary providers of high quality post-secondary education for persons of color in the greater Los Angeles County region for over three-quarters of a century, from 1927 until 2006;   Whereas the Compton Community College District Board of Trustees, looking toward the re-establishment of Compton Community College’s proud history, has hired Dr. Keith Curry, a highly regarded member of the academic community, to lead in their pursuit of accreditation as Chief Executive Officer of the Compton Community College District;   Whereas Compton Community College is under review for accredited status and has worked with schools of good standing and the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges; and   Whereas Compton Community College has endeavored in earnest to make necessary reforms to prove itself qualified for accreditation, and has earned consideration to once again be an accredited, self-determining and excellent academic program: Now, therefore, be it
