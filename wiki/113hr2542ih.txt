If the head of the agency determines that completion of the review of existing rules is not feasible by the established date, the head of the agency shall so certify in a statement published in the Federal Register and may extend the review for not longer than 2 years after publication of notice of extension in the Federal Register. Such certification and notice shall be sent to the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]] and the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] .
:(c) The plan shall include a section that details how an agency will conduct outreach to and meaningfully include small businesses for the purposes of carrying out this section. The agency shall include in this section a plan for how the agency will contact small businesses and gather their input on existing agency rules.
:(d) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding the results of its review pursuant to such plan to the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]] , and, in the case of agencies other than independent regulatory agencies (as defined in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3502 section 3502(5)of title 44] ) to the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget]] . Such report shall include the identification of any rule with respect to which the head of the agency made a determination described in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 paragraph (5)] or [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 (6) of subsection (e)] and a detailed explanation of the reasons for such determination.
:(e) In reviewing a rule pursuant to [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 subsections (a) through (d)] , the agency shall amend or rescind the rule to minimize any adverse significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or disproportionate economic impact on a specific class of small entities, or maximize any beneficial significant economic impact of the rule on a substantial number of small entities to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes. In amending or rescinding the rule, the agency shall consider the following factors:
::(1) The continued need for the rule.
::(2) The nature of complaints received by the agency from small entities concerning the rule.
::(3) Comments by the [[w:Small Business Administration|Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman]] and the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]] .
::(4) The complexity of the rule.
::(5) The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts with other Federal rules and, unless the head of the agency determines it to be infeasible, State, territorial, and local rules.
::(6) The contribution of the rule to the cumulative economic impact of all Federal rules on the class of small entities affected by the rule, unless the head of the agency determines that such calculations cannot be made and reports that determination in the annual report required under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/610 subsection (d)] .
::(7) The length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.
:(f) The agency shall publish in the Federal Register and on its website a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to such plan. Such publication shall include a brief description of the rule, the reason why the agency determined that it has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (without regard to whether it had prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and request comments from the public, the [[w:Small Business Administration|Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration]] , and the [[w:Small Business Administration|Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman]] concerning the enforcement of the rule..
