The
			 [[Wikipedia:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], acting through the
			 [[Wikipedia:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety]], shall conduct research and a
			 study, in accordance with the requirements of this section, regarding the
			 development and efficacy of medical checklists.

=={{anchor|H7F59E54D1D3A417F83D2F5B5B18094AC}}(b) Contents– ==

In
			 carrying out subsection (a), the [[Wikipedia:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Director]] shall conduct research and a study
			 regarding the following:
:(1) Testing of
			 different models of medical checklists to measure the effect of checklist
			 format, length, and design for different clinical tasks on—
::(A) adoption of
			 checklists by health care professionals;
::(B) time spent by
			 health care professionals on the clinical task of interest; and
::(C) reliable
			 completion of health care procedures.
:(2) Examination of
			 checklist development and use in other industries, such as commercial aviation
			 and nuclear power, and the feasibility of applying and adapting methodology
			 developed in those industries to the health care industry in a way that would
			 result in health care quality improvement.
:(3) Identification of
			 organizational characteristics needed to effectively implement the use of
			 medical checklists in health care settings.
:(4) Measurement of the
			 effects of the use of medical checklists on patient safety and health
			 outcomes.
:(5) Identification of
			 health care procedures for which the development and use of medical checklists
			 would be beneficial.
:(6) Investigation of
			 the development, implementation, and use of available medical checklists,
			 including checklists for safe surgery and central line insertion and
			 maintenance, to inform further medical checklist development.

			 which medical checklists in electronic formats can be used by health care
			 professionals.
:(2) The effect of the
			 availability of medical checklists in electronic formats on the adoption and
			 use of medical checklists by health care professionals.
:(3) The effect of the
			 use of medical checklists in electronic formats on the time spent by health
			 care professionals on medical procedures.
:(4) The ability of the
			 health information technology system to collect data on patient safety and
			 health outcomes that could be analyzed to aid in the design and update of
			 medical checklists.
:(5) The ease with
			 which medical checklists in electronic formats can be updated on an ongoing
			 basis based on evidence from medical research and local experience.
:(6) The capability of
			 health information technology systems to collect data, where applicable,
			 regarding the use of medical checklists by health care clinicians and
			 providers, and any relation between that use and patient safety and health
			 outcomes.
