To amend the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of voluntary advance care planning consultation under Medicare and Medicaid, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title; findings; table of contents=



==(a) Short title– ==

This Act may be cited as the“Personalize Your Care Act of 2013”.

==(b) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) All individuals should be afforded the opportunity to fully participate in decisions related to their health care or the care of a person for whom they are the proxy or surrogate.
:(2) Every individual's values and goals should be identified, understood, and respected. Particular attention should be paid to populations which have not regularly had the opportunity to express their choices or preferences.
:(3) Advance care planning plays a valuable role in achieving quality care by informing physicians and family members of an individual’s treatment preferences should he or she become unable to direct care.
:(4) Early advance care planning is ideal because a person’s ability to make decisions may diminish over time and the person may suddenly lose the capability to participate in their health care decisions.
:(5) Advance directives (such as living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care) must be prepared while individuals have the capacity to complete them and only apply to future medical circumstances when decisionmaking capacity is lost. An individual can change or revoke an advance directive at any time.
:(6) Physician orders for life-sustaining treatment complement advance directives by providing a process to focus patients’ values, goals, and preferences on current medical circumstances and to translate them into visible and portable medical orders applicable across care settings. A patient (or proxy or surrogate) can change or revoke a physician order for life-sustaining treatment at any time.
:(7) Advance care planning should be routinely conducted in community and clinical practices. Care plans should be periodically revisited to reflect a person’s changes in values and perceptions at different stages and circumstances of life. This shared decisionmaking and collaborative planning between the patient (or proxy or surrogate) and the clinician of their choice will lead to more person-centered, culturally appropriate care.
:(8) Effective, respectful, and culturally competent advance care planning requires recognition that both overtreatment and undertreatment may be concerns of individuals contemplating future care.
:(9) More should be done within local health systems to establish specific policies and programs to assist people with sensory, mental, and other disabilities in order to maximize the degree to which they are active participants in the decisions related to their health care, including training health care providers to be aware of augmentative communication devices and how to communicate with people with developmental, psychiatric, speech, and sensory disabilities.
:(10) Studies funded by the [[w:Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] have shown that individuals who talked with their families or physicians about their preferences for care had less fear and anxiety, felt they had more ability to influence and direct their medical care, believed that their physicians had a better understanding of their wishes, and indicated a greater understanding and comfort level than they had before the discussion. Patients who had advance planning discussions with their physicians continued to discuss and talk about these concerns with their families. Such discussions enabled patients and families to reconcile any differences about care and could help the family and physician come to agreement if they should need to make decisions for the patient.
:(11) A decade of research has demonstrated that physician orders for life-sustaining treatment effectively convey patient preferences and guide medical personnel toward medical treatment aligned with patient wishes. Programs for these orders have developed locally on a statewide or communitywide basis and have different program names, forms, and policies, but all follow the principle of patient-centered care.
:(12) According to research published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, between 65 and 76 percent of physicians whose patients had an advance directive were not aware that it existed.
:(13) Including completed advance care planning documents within a patient’s electronic health record can increase the likelihood these documents are kept up-to-date and available at the right place at the right time.
