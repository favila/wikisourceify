{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish a Pay It Forward model for funding postsecondary education.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “ Pay It Forward College Affordability Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings; Purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Postsecondary education has expanded opportunities for people in the United States to qualify for high-quality jobs and entry into the middle class, providing clear benefits to the Nation’s economy.
:(2) Public investment by the States in higher education has decreased significantly, especially in the past 5 years before the date of enactment of this Act, as a result of the 2008 fiscal collapse.
:(3) With college costs rising beyond the reach of many people in the United States, financial aid programs are inadequate to reach all students with financial need.
:(4) The increasing unaffordability of a college education has forced students to borrow more money to pay for higher education, causing two-thirds of college seniors to graduate with an average student debt of $26,600.
:(5) High levels of student debt are damaging not only to the individual student’s ability to succeed financially but also will have grave consequences for the future economy of the United States.
:(6)  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] must halt the decrease in State support for education and, over time, must catalyze increases in State funding for higher education.
:(7) There is a need to encourage a new approach to financing the students’ share of the cost of higher education that will not result in graduates who are overburdened with student debt.
:(8) The Pay It Forward model presents a new opportunity for financing and expanding higher education, through the replacement of tuition and mandatory fees with a post-graduation contribution program that establishes the funding for access to higher education for the next generational cohort of students.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to test and encourage the development of Pay It Forward model financing programs.

=Sec. 3. Definitions=

In this Act:

==(1) Annual Income– ==

The term annual income means an amount equal to the sum of—
:(A) annual adjusted gross income, as defined in  [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/62 section 62] of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and

:(B) such student signs a contract agreeing to contribute to the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] , a State, or an institution of higher education, as the case may be, a certain percentage (not to exceed 5 percent) of the student’s annual income, for a specified number of years upon graduation or when the student ceases to be enrolled at such institution of higher education, except that the specified number of years for which the student agrees to contribute according to such contract shall not exceed 25 years, which shall be known as the “Pay It Forward Contribution Plan” .

:(6) if the student obtains Federal student loans, such student shall remain eligible for applicable Federal loan repayment, forgiveness, or similar programs regarding such Federal student loans to the same extent that the student would be eligible for such repayment, forgiveness, or similar programs if the student were not also participating in the Pay It Forward Contribution Plan.

Not later than 5 years after the establishment of the State Pay It Forward models under section 5, the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] shall, after consideration of the advisory council recommendations regarding how to evaluate the Pay It Forward Contribution Plan described under section 6(a), conduct an initial evaluation of the Pay It Forward Contribution Plan, which may include an evaluation of—
:(1) how the rates of contribution under the Pay It Forward model may differ according to different income levels;
:(2) the rates of students who fail to contribute funds as agreed to under the Pay It Forward model;

:(5) ways to integrate existing Federal student loan repayment and forgiveness programs into the Pay It Forward model.

==(b) Evaluation– ==

Not later than 10 years after the establishment of the Pay It Forward Contribution Plan described under section 5, the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] shall, after consideration of the advisory council recommendations regarding how to evaluate the Pay It Forward Contribution Plan—
:(1) evaluate whether existing student loan debt could be converted into a Pay It Forward model;
:(2) evaluate the impact of the Pay It Forward model on a student's career choices and employment, including how such model may impact a student's employment in public service jobs and level of employment (such as whether a student participating in the Pay It Forward model will go on to part time or full time employment);
:(3) evaluate mechanisms through which employers could provide funds toward the contributions that an employee is required to make under a Pay It Forward model contribution agreement;
:(4) examine the long-term solvency and feasibility of an expanded Pay It Forward program; and
:(5) examine the distributional implications of allowing students to opt out of participation in a Pay It Forward model program as compared to requiring all students who are enrolled at a participating institution to participate in a Pay It Forward model program.

==(c) Report– ==

Upon completion of the evaluation described under subsection (a), the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] shall prepare and submit a report containing the results of such evaluation to the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate]] , the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate]] , the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Finance|Committee on Finance of the Senate]] , the [[w:United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives]] , the [[w:United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives]] , and the [[w:United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives]] .

=Sec. 8. Expanded Implementation=

The [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] may expand the Pay It Forward model, including by developing Pay It Forward model pilot programs for students pursuing post-baccalaureate degrees that relate to the medical profession in order to meet the need for more primary medical care providers, increasing the number or duration of grants to States for carrying out a Pay It Forward State pilot program, or establishing a Federal program based on the Pay It Forward model, if the [[w:United States Department of Education|Secretary]] determines that doing so—
:(1) will not increase the cost to the Federal Government for carrying out Federal loan programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1070 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.] );
:(2) may be carried out using amounts available for the programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1070 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.] ); and
:(3) is in the best interests of students and the Nation in advancing national priorities for education, health, and economic development.
