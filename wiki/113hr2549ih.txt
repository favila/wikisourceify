=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Biliteracy Education Seal and Teaching Act” or the “BEST Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The people of the United States celebrate cultural and linguistic diversity and seek to prepare students with skills to succeed in the 21st century.
:(2) It is fitting to commend the dedication of students who have achieved proficiency in multiple languages and to encourage their peers to follow in their footsteps.
:(3) The study of world languages in elementary and secondary schools should be encouraged because it contributes to a student’s cognitive development and to the national economy and security.
:(4) Recognition of student achievement in language proficiency will enable institutions of higher education and employers to readily recognize and acknowledge the valuable expertise of bilingual students in academia and the workplace.
:(5) California has pioneered the first State system in the Nation to recognize students for achieving proficiency in multiple languages. In 2012, California awarded a Seal of Biliteracy to over 10,000 graduating high school seniors in 37 school districts.
:(6) Students in every State should be able to benefit from a Seal of Biliteracy program.
