=Sec. 4. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act include the following:
:(1) To establish an advisory committee to issue nonbinding guidelines for all three branches of Government regarding making public information available on the Internet, with sufficient flexibility to adapt to changes in technology.
:(2) To empower the [[w:Office of Management and Budget|E-Government Administrator]]to establish binding rules concerning making publicly available Government information held by Executive agencies to be made available on the Internet, and to empower independent regulatory agencies to do the same.
:(3) To express the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that publicly available information held by the legislative and judicial branches should be available on the Internet.
:(4) To encourage the [[w:Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]]to make all of its publications available on the Internet in the formats most useful to the public, after having considered the formats identified by the [[w:|Public Online Information Advisory Committee]]. 

=Sec. 5. Findings of Congress=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The Federal Government holds a vast repository of public information. Throughout the Nation’s history, the Government has attempted to make that information available to the public, whether through the [[w:United States Postal Service|United States Postal Service]], the Federal Depository Library Program, the Presidential Library System, Agency Reading Rooms, under the Freedom of Information Act, or by other means. Providing this information to the general public is a public good: informed citizens are informed voters. However, even with these efforts, Government information is too often hard to find, difficult to understand, expensive to obtain in useful formats, and available in only a few locations.
:(2) The advent of the Internet presents the opportunity for the Government to make information readily available to many more Americans. The Internet is ubiquitous, turning every computer into a portal to the world’s largest library. The Government has made some efforts to take advantage of this new medium. As the public moves online, the Government must do so as well.
:(3) In addition to the traditional means of disseminating public information, the Federal Government should make all of its public information available on the Internet. It should do so in ways that take advantage of modern technology, that anticipate the public’s needs, and that provide access to the greatest number of people. The Government should strive to make its information available on the Internet in real-time and in machine processable formats.
:(4) The creation of this vast new information library will empower citizens to gain a better understanding of how their Government functions and what it does in their name. It will also give innovators new tools to build on this information and provide better goods and services to the American people. Government services will be provided more efficiently, saving the taxpayers money and allowing them to be more involved in the lives of their communities.
:(5) Accomplishing these goals requires significant coordination. It also requires the creation of new authorities and responsibilities within the Government, and the identification of appropriate technology standards.

===(4) Special Counsel– ===

Whenever the court orders the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant and assesses against the United States reasonable attorney fees, litigation costs, and interest, and the court additionally issues a written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, a Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding. A Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his representative. The administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends.
