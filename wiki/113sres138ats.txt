{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Congratulating the students, parents, teachers, and administrators of charter schools across the United States for their ongoing contributions to education, and supporting the ideals and goals of the 14th annual National Charter Schools Week, to be celebrated the week of May 5 through May 11, 2013.    Whereas charter schools are public schools that do not charge tuition and that enroll any student who wants to attend, often through a random lottery when too many students want to attend a single charter school;   Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality public education and challenge all students to reach their potential;   Whereas charter schools promote innovation and excellence in public education;   Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with diverse and innovative educational options for their children;   Whereas charter schools are authorized by a designated public entity and— 
:(1) respond to the needs of communities, families, and students in the United States; and 
:(2) promote the principles of quality, accountability, choice, and innovation;   Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, charter schools are held accountable by their sponsors for improving student achievement and for the financial and other operations of the charter schools;   Whereas charter schools are required to meet the student achievement accountability requirements under the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] )in the same manner as traditional public schools;   Whereas charter schools often set higher expectations for students in addition to the requirements under the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] )to ensure that charter schools are of high quality and are truly accountable to the public;   Whereas 42 States and the District of Columbia have enacted laws authorizing charter schools;   Whereas more than 6,000 charter schools are serving more than 2,300,000 children;   Whereas, in the United States— 
:(1) in 110 school districts, more than 10 percent of public school students are enrolled in charter schools; 
:(2) in 25 school districts, more than 20 percent of public school students are enrolled in charter schools; and 
:(3) in 7 districts, at least 30 percent of public school students are enrolled in charter schools;   Whereas charter schools improve the achievement of students they enroll and stimulate improvement in traditional public schools;   Whereas charter schools— 
:(1) give parents the freedom to choose public schools; 
:(2) routinely measure parental satisfaction levels; and 
:(3) must prove their ongoing success to parents, policymakers, and the communities they serve;   Whereas an estimated 610,000 students were on waiting lists to attend charter schools before the beginning of the 2011–2012 academic year; and   Whereas the 14th annual National Charter Schools Week is scheduled to be celebrated the week of May 5 through May 11, 2013: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] —
:(1) congratulates the students, parents, teachers, and administrators of charter schools across the United States for—
::(A) their ongoing contributions to education;
::(B) impressive strides made in closing the academic achievement gap in schools in the United States; and
::(C) improving and strengthening the public school system in the United States;
:(2) supports the ideals and goals of the 14th annual National Charter Schools Week, a weeklong celebration to be held the week of May 5 through May 11, 2013, in communities throughout the United States; and
:(3) encourages the people of the United States to hold appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities during National Charter Schools Week to demonstrate support for charter schools.
