=Sec. 2. Findings and purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The non-partisan [[w:Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office]] found that comprehensive immigration reform would reduce the national deficit by billions, strengthen Social Security solvency, increase the number of jobs, and raise Gross Domestic Product.
:(2) According to a report by the Partnership for a New American Economy, in 2010 more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, generating a combined revenue of $4,200,000,000,000.
:(3) Thousands of deferred action childhood arrival students graduate from high schools in the United States every year but only a small fraction of those students enroll in higher education.
:(4) Many jobs in the 21st century economy require some form of postsecondary education.
:(5) Education provides an important pathway to the middle class; college graduates have higher earnings and lower unemployment rates than their less educated peers.
:(6) Since 2008, States are spending 28 percent less per student in higher education, and tuition and fees continue to rise. The increased costs are being shifted to students and student loan debt continues to grow.
:(7) Investments in higher education provide youth a ladder to achieving the American dream.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are to—
:(1) allow States to provide immigrant students timely and affordable access to higher education;
:(2) incentivize States to maintain support for higher education; and
:(3) promote increased access and affordability to postsecondary education for students through State need-based financial aid.
