=={{anchor|H3130345F946C4E0E9BACF862B3CD4D24}}Sec. 101. Findings==

The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] makes the following
			 findings:
:(1) Rising costs
			 resulting from natural disasters are placing an increasing strain on the
			 ability of property and casualty insurance companies to assure payment of
			 homeowners’ claims and other insurance claims arising from major natural
			 disasters now and in the future.
:(2) Present tax laws
			 do not provide adequate incentives to assure that natural disaster insurance is
			 provided or, where such insurance is provided, that funds are available for
			 payment of insurance claims in the event of future catastrophic losses from
			 major natural disasters, as present law requires an insurer wishing to
			 accumulate surplus assets for this purpose to do so entirely from its after-tax
			 retained earnings.
:(3) Revising the tax
			 laws applicable to the property and casualty insurance industry to permit
			 carefully controlled accumulation of pretax dollars in separate reserve funds
			 devoted solely to the payment of claims arising from future major natural
			 disasters will provide incentives for property and casualty insurers to make
			 natural disaster insurance available, will give greater protection to the
			 Nation’s homeowners, small businesses, and other insurance consumers, and will
			 help assure the future financial health of the Nation’s insurance system as a
			 whole.
:(4) Implementing these
			 changes will reduce the possibility that a significant portion of the private
			 insurance system would fail in the wake of a major natural disaster and that
			 governmental entities would be required to step in to provide relief at
			 taxpayer expense.
