{{Center|A BILL}}

To facilitate nationwide availability of volunteer income
		  tax assistance for low-income and underserved populations, and for other
		  purposes.

={{anchor|H5780B4ABD779475BB612D4592E9E7EA6}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the
			 “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)
			 Act”.

={{anchor|H7D55093AB6B9406B913DBE1FFCDAC5E2}}Sec. 2. Findings=

Congress makes the following
			 findings:
:(1) Community
			 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) programs offer tax preparation and
			 related financial services, free of charge, to middle- and low-income
			 individuals and families. The majority of individuals served by VITA programs
			 have annual household earnings below $40,000.
:(2) During the 2012
			 Federal income tax filing season, VITA programs filed 1,600,000 Federal income
			 tax returns and prepared more than 505,000 returns for the earned income tax
			 credit (EITC), helping program recipients claim $2,200,000,000 in Federal tax
			 refunds. One in five taxpayers who were eligible to claim the EITC failed to do
			 so.
:(3) VITA programs
			 assist underserved taxpayers, including low-wage workers, persons with
			 disabilities, the elderly, Native Americans, rural populations, and taxpayers
			 with limited English proficiency.
:(4) Volunteer tax
			 preparation programs save the [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] an estimated $5,500,000
			 a year in return processing costs. In 2012, clients of VITA programs
			 electronically filed their tax returns at a much higher rate (95 percent) than
			 the general population (82 percent).
:(5) Not only do
			 electronic returns cost the [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] considerably less to
			 process ($0.17 per return) than paper returns ($3.66 per return), but
			 electronic returns also generate a low error rate of 2.5 percent compared with
			 a 25 percent error rate for paper returns. Low error rates reduce the need for
			 the [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] to correspond with taxpayers and for taxpayers to
			 resubmit paperwork.
:(6) The use of
			 technology in meeting the needs of taxpayers with physical, sensory, or
			 cognitive disabilities is essential to the success of the VITA program, as
			 demonstrated through the expanded use of innovative assistive technology and
			 strategies intended to expand free tax preparation for deaf and hearing
			 impaired taxpayers. These innovative uses of assistive technologies should
			 continue to be replicated and tested to expand capacity of VITA programs in
			 successfully meeting the needs of taxpayers with various disabilities.
:(7) An Internal
			 Revenue Service survey has shown that very low-income taxpayers are twice as
			 likely as the general population to visit a Taxpayer Assistance Center and half
			 as likely to use the Internal Revenue Service Web site. Volunteer tax
			 preparation programs serve as an accessible and cost-effective alternative to
			 other Internal Revenue Service channels.
:(8) [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue
			 Service]] estimates from fiscal year 2005 found that the volunteer preparation
			 program cost $12.01 per contact, while Taxpayer Assistance Centers and assisted
			 toll-free calls averaged $28.73 and $19.46 per contact, respectively.
:(9) The number of tax
			 returns prepared by the VITA program increased 220 percent between the 2004
			 (500,000) and 2012 (1,600,000 returns) tax filing seasons.
:(10) The demand on
			 this integral community service continues to rise as the nation recovers from
			 the significant economic downturn of recent years and VITA programs are
			 experiencing strained resources and limited capacity.
:(11) In fiscal year
			 2013, 333 organizations applied to the Internal Revenue Service seeking more
			 than $27,900,000 in grant funding—more than double the available
			 resources—through the VITA program, and 206 received grants at a median grant
			 of approximately $38,500.
