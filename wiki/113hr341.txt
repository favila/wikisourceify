[[Wikipedia:Mike Honda|Mr. Honda ]](for himself and 
[[Wikipedia:Danny K. Davis|Mr. Danny K. Davis of Illinois ]]) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[Wikipedia:United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]]}}


{{Center|A BILL}}

To facilitate nationwide availability of volunteer income tax assistance for low-income and underserved populations, and for other purposes.
1. Short title


This Act may be cited as the “Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Act”.

2. Findings


Congress makes the following findings:
: Community Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) programs offer tax preparation and related financial services, free of charge, to middle- and low-income individuals and families. The majority of individuals served by VITA programs have annual household earnings below $40,000.: During the 2012 Federal income tax filing season, VITA programs filed 1,600,000 Federal income tax returns and prepared more than 505,000 returns for the earned income tax credit (EITC), helping program recipients claim $2,200,000,000 in Federal tax refunds. One in five taxpayers who were eligible to claim the EITC failed to do so.: VITA programs assist underserved taxpayers, including low-wage workers, persons with disabilities, the elderly, Native Americans, rural populations, and taxpayers with limited English proficiency.: Volunteer tax preparation programs save the [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service ]]an estimated $5,500,000 a year in return processing costs. In 2012, clients of VITA programs electronically filed their tax returns at a much higher rate (95 percent) than the general population (82 percent).: Not only do electronic returns cost the [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service ]]considerably less to process ($0.17 per return) than paper returns ($3.66 per return), but electronic returns also generate a low error rate of 2.5 percent compared with a 25 percent error rate for paper returns. Low error rates reduce the need for the [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service ]]to correspond with taxpayers and for taxpayers to resubmit paperwork.: The use of technology in meeting the needs of taxpayers with physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities is essential to the success of the VITA program, as demonstrated through the expanded use of innovative assistive technology and strategies intended to expand free tax preparation for deaf and hearing impaired taxpayers. These innovative uses of assistive technologies should continue to be replicated and tested to expand capacity of VITA programs in successfully meeting the needs of taxpayers with various disabilities.: An Internal Revenue Service survey has shown that very low-income taxpayers are twice as likely as the general population to visit a Taxpayer Assistance Center and half as likely to use the Internal Revenue Service Web site. Volunteer tax preparation programs serve as an accessible and cost-effective alternative to other Internal Revenue Service channels.: [[Wikipedia:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service ]]estimates from fiscal year 2005 found that the volunteer preparation program cost $12.01 per contact, while Taxpayer Assistance Centers and assisted toll-free calls averaged $28.73 and $19.46 per contact, respectively.: The number of tax returns prepared by the VITA program increased 220 percent between the 2004 (500,000) and 2012 (1,600,000 returns) tax filing seasons.: The demand on this integral community service continues to rise as the nation recovers from the significant economic downturn of recent years and VITA programs are experiencing strained resources and limited capacity.: In fiscal year 2013, 333 organizations applied to the Internal Revenue Service seeking more than $27,900,000 in grant funding—more than double the available resources—through the VITA program, and 206 received grants at a median grant of approximately $38,500.
