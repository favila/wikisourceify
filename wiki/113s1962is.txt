::(C) set a national example for the ability of working people in the United States to change the existing system in favor of more just practices for protecting workers rights and safety;
:(6) following the deaths of a number of workers at the hands of the United States military and United States Marshals during the 1894 strike, Congress unanimously voted to approve rush legislation that created a national Labor Day holiday, which was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland 6 days after the end of the strike;
:(7) the Pullman Palace Car Company also played an important role in African-American and early civil rights history through the legacy of the Pullman porters, many of whom were ex-slaves were employed in a heavily discriminatory environment immediately following the Civil War;

:(13) the preservation of the Pullman site has been threatened by—
::(A) plans for demolition in 1960; and
