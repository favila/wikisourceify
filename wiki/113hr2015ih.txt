=Sec. 2. Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds that—
:(1) since 1933, the Upper Las Vegas Wash has been valued by scientists because of the significant paleontological resources demonstrative of the Pleistocene Epoch that are located in the area;
:(2) in 2004, during the preparation of the Las Vegas Valley Disposal Boundary Final Environmental Impact Statement, the Bureau of Land Management identified sensitive biological, cultural, and paleontological resources determined to be worthy of more evaluation with respect to the protective status of the resources;
:(3) the Upper Las Vegas Wash contains thousands of paleontological resources from the Pleistocene Epoch that are preserved in a unique geological context that are of national importance, including Columbian mammoth, ground sloth, American lion, camels, and horse fossils;
:(4) in addition to Joshua trees and several species of cacti, the Las Vegas buckwheat, Merriam’s bearpoppy, and the Las Vegas bearpoppy are 3 unique and imperiled plants that are supported in the harsh desert environment of Tule Springs;
:(5) the area provides important habitat for threatened desert tortoise, endemic poppy bees, kit foxes, burrowing owls, LeConte’s thrasher, phainopepla, and a variety of reptiles;
:(6) in studies of the area conducted during the last decade, the Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service determined that the area likely contains the longest continuous section of Pleistocene strata in the desert southwest, which span multiple important global climate cooling and warming episodes;
:(7) the Upper Las Vegas Wash is significant to the culture and history of the native and indigenous people of the area, including the Southern Paiute Tribe;
:(8) despite the findings of the studies and recommendations for further assessment of the resources for appropriate methods of protection—
::(A) the area remains inadequately protected; and
::(B) many irreplaceable fossil specimens in the area have been lost to vandalism or theft; and
:(9) designation of the Upper Las Vegas Wash site as a National Monument would protect the unique fossil resources of the area and the geological context of those resources for present and future generations while allowing for public education and continued scientific research opportunities.
