{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating February 3 through 7, 2014, as“National School Counseling Week”.    Whereas the American School Counselor Association has designated February 3 through 7, 2014, as“National School Counseling Week”;   Whereas the importance of school counseling has been recognized through the inclusion of elementary and secondary school counseling programs in amendments to the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq].);   Whereas school counselors have long advocated for equal opportunities for all students;   Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded students by guiding students through academic, personal, social, and career development;   Whereas personal and social growth results in increased academic achievement;   Whereas school counselors play a vital role in ensuring that students are ready for college and careers;   Whereas school counselors play a vital role in making students aware of opportunities for financial aid and college scholarships;   Whereas school counselors assist with and coordinate efforts to foster a positive school climate, resulting in a safer learning environment for all students;   Whereas school counselors have been instrumental in helping students, teachers, and parents deal with personal trauma as well as tragedies in their communities and the United States;   Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, including peer pressure, bullying, depression, the deployment of family members to serve in conflicts overseas, and school violence;   Whereas a school counselor is one of the few professionals in a school building who is trained in both education and mental health matters;   Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors are often misunderstood;   Whereas the school counselor position is often among the first to be eliminated to meet budgetary constraints;   Whereas the national average ratio of students to school counselors is 471 to 1, almost twice the 250 to 1 ratio recommended by the American School Counselor Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and other organizations; and   Whereas the celebration of National School Counseling Week will increase awareness of the important and necessary role school counselors play in the lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
