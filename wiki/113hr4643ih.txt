:(B) if the borrower continues to make on-time payments (in the amount determined prior to the death or bankruptcy of the cosigner) on the private education loan, provide a period of time of not less than 90 days for the borrower to follow the process for release of the cosigner before deeming the borrower to be in default, changing the terms of the loan, accelerating the repayment terms of the loan, or notifying consumer reporting agencies (as defined in section 603(f) ) of a change in the status of the loan.

===(3) Requirements in case of death or bankruptcy of a cosigner– ===

Notwithstanding any provision in a private education loan agreement, a private educational lender shall, upon receiving notification of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner who is jointly liable for the private education loan—
:(A) notify the borrower about the borrower’s rights under the private education loan agreement regarding identifying a new cosigner or refinancing the loan; and
:(B) if the borrower continues to make on-time payments (in the amount determined prior to the death or bankruptcy of the cosigner) on the private education loan, provide a period of time of not less than 90 days for a borrower to identify a new cosigner or refinance the loan before deeming the borrower to be in default, changing the terms of the loan, accelerating the repayment terms of the loan, or notifying consumer reporting agencies (as defined in section 603(f) ) of a change in the status of the loan. .
