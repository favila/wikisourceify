==(b) Security measures– ==

Site security plans required under subsection (a) may include layered security measures that, in combination, appropriately address the security vulnerability assessment and the risk-based performance standards for security for the facility.

==(c) Approval or disapproval of site security plans– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] shall review and approve or disapprove each security vulnerability assessment and site security plan under subsection (a) .

===(2) Alternative security programs– ===

The [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] may approve an alternative security program established by a private sector entity or a Federal, State, or local authority or pursuant to other applicable laws, if the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] determines that the requirements of such program meet the requirements of this section. A covered chemical facility may meet the site security plan requirement under subsection (a) by adopting an alternative security program that has been reviewed and approved by the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] under this paragraph.

===(3) Site security plan assessments– ===

In approving or disapproving a site security plan under this subsection, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] shall employ the risk assessment policies and procedures developed under this Act.

If the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] determines that a covered chemical facility is not in compliance with this section, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] shall provide the owner or operator of the facility with written notification (including a clear explanation of any deficiency in the security vulnerability assessment or site security plan) and opportunity for consultation with the Secretary or the Secretary’s designee, and shall issue an order to comply by such date as the Secretary determines to be appropriate under the circumstances. If the owner or operator continues to be in noncompliance after the date specified in such order, the [[w:Department of Homeland Security|Secretary]] may enter an order assessing a civil penalty, an order to cease operations, or both.

===(3) Personnel surety– ===
