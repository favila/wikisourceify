==Title I— Office of Science and Technology Policy==



==Sec. 101. Federal research and development funding==



===(a) Sense of Congress– ===

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) investments in research and development activities have historically delivered significant benefits, including contributing to economic growth, workforce development, national security, and other priorities;
:(2) maintaining U.S. economic competitiveness requires a robust research foundation, the promotion of a scientifically literate workforce, and the effective commercialization of research products;
:(3) many research and development initiatives, due to the long time periods required to achieve completion, can benefit from stable and predictable investments and from multi-year financial planning;
:(4) the Federal science agencies should receive sustained and steady growth in funding for research and development activities, including basic research, across a wide range of disciplines, including physical, geological, and life sciences, mathematics, engineering, and social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and
:(5) to enhance and maintain the quality and credibility of Federal research and development funding decisions, the Federal science agencies should continue—
::(A) to utilize competitive, merit-review processes in evaluating external proposals for research and development funding; and
::(B) to solicit advice from independent scientific advisory boards and committees representing the nation's geographic diversity.

===(b) Declaration of policy– ===

Since research and development activities constitute a national need, it is the policy of the United States that—
:(1) in developing and implementing their research and development strategies, Federal science agencies should encourage collaboration among industry, the Federal Government, academia, and other public and nonprofit entities; and
:(2) research and development funding priorities of Federal science agencies should be informed by the independent, expert advice of Federal scientific advisory committees and boards, within the broader context of agency mission requirements.

==Sec. 102. Federal 5-year STEM education strategic plan==



===(a) Findings– ===

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) STEM knowledge and skills are more important than ever before to jobs throughout the economy and STEM education is critical to imparting those skills to future workers.
:(2) Increasing the number and diversity of students trained in STEM fields and retaining STEM professionals is critical to supporting U.S. competitiveness within a global economy.
:(3) STEM literacy, a basic understanding of STEM concepts and principles, is critical to U.S. consumers' evaluation of scientific information and to informing national, local, and personal decisions in a range of areas, including healthcare and criminal justice.

===(b) Sense of Congress– ===

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that updates to the Federal 5-year STEM education strategic plan required by  section 101 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6621 42 U.S.C. 6621] ), actions to implement the plan and its updates, and the Federal STEM education investments should—
:(1) support the development of a STEM workforce that is responsive to the needs of industry, academia, and Federal, State, and local governments;
:(2) leverage and incorporate the expertise of a broad range of STEM educators and beneficiaries, including—
::(A) public and private sector employers that rely on an educated STEM workforce;
::(B) institutions of higher education;
::(C) non-profit STEM education groups and informal STEM education providers; and
::(D) Federal, State, and local agencies involved in STEM education;
:(3) seek to optimize Federal STEM education initiatives and decisions related to the expansion, consolidation, or reorganization of STEM programs, and be supported both by program evaluations and by careful consideration of each affected program’s contribution to STEM education;
:(4) encourage student exposure to scientists and engineers by maintaining the role of Federal science agencies, such as the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], and STEM professionals in education and outreach activities; and
:(5) support active, collaborative, and inquiry-based STEM learning approaches that develop creative thinking and critical analysis skills rather than solely emphasizing memorization.

===(c) COMPETES reauthorization amendments– ===

   Section 101 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/6621 42 U.S.C. 6621] )is amended by adding at the end the following:

To encourage alignment between the strategic plan and national STEM needs, the [[w:Office of Science and Technology Policy|Chairperson]]shall encourage comment, in particular, from State and local educational agencies, informal STEM education groups, nonprofit STEM education organizations, STEM-related industries, and institutions of higher education, including community colleges. For purposes of this subsection, the term community college means an institution of higher education (as defined under  section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1001 20 U.S.C. 1001] )) at which the highest degree that is predominately awarded to students is an associate's degree. 

====(e) Informal STEM education– ====

In updating and implementing the 5-year STEM education strategic plan, the [[w:Office of Science and Technology Policy|National Science and Technology Council Committee on STEM Education]]shall develop guidance and best practices for Federal agencies on incorporating and encouraging informal STEM education efforts to support youth and public engagement in STEM fields.

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]makes the following findings:
:(1) The National Nanotechnology Initiative is a multiagency Federal Government research and development program established in 2001.
:(2) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, more than $18,000,000,000 has been invested in nanoscience and nanotechnology through the National Nanotechnology Initiative.
:(3) Of the 20 agencies participating in the National Nanotechnology Initiative, 11 have budgets for nanotechnology-related research and development.
:(4) Research supported by the National Nanotechnology Initiative is advancing our fundamental understanding and techniques to enable the measurement, manipulation, and control of matter at the nanoscale.
:(5) In order for U.S. companies and society to benefit from this research, the National Nanotechnology Initiative needs to support the engineering, scale-up, and commercialization of nanotechnology-enabled materials, devices, systems, and products.
:(6) An important achievement of the National Nanotechnology Initiative is the development of an extensive infrastructure of interdisciplinary research, development, and education centers, networks, and user facilities that should be continued, supported, and expanded.
:(7) The field of nanotechnology is expanding rapidly and is projected to develop closely with other emerging and converging bio and information technologies, creating new science and engineering domains and manufacturing paradigms.
:(8) The United States is the world leader in nanoscience and nanotechnology and the creation of nanotechnology knowledge as measured by the number and quality of scientific papers and patents. However, international indicators, such as foreign government and corporate funding and publications and patent applications, suggest that the United States is facing increasing global competition in nanotechnology.
