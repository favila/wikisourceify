{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Congratulating the Minnesota Lynx women's basketball team on winning the 2013 Women's National Basketball Association Championship.    Whereas on October 10, 2013, the Minnesota Lynx won the 2013 Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) Championship;   Whereas this is the second WNBA Championship for the Minnesota Lynx in 3 years;   Whereas the Minnesota Lynx won every game in the 2013 WNBA playoffs, beating the Seattle Storm in the Western Conference semifinals, the Phoenix Mercury in the Conference finals, and decisively beating the Atlanta Dream in the Championship round;   Whereas, on average, more than 13,000 fans attended each home game during the Championship round at the Target Center in Minneapolis to cheer on the Minnesota Lynx;   Whereas the Minnesota Lynx feature 3 gold medal-winning Olympians, Maya Moore, Seimone Augustus, and Lindsay Whalen, and a highly talented team of professionals, including Rebekkah Brunson, Janel McCarville, and Monica Wright; and   Whereas the Minnesota Lynx are one of only four WNBA teams to win multiple titles, with both championships coming under the coaching guidance of Cheryl Reeve: Now, therefore, be it
