 To prevent deaths occurring from drug overdoses.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Stop Overdose Stat Act   ”or the“ S.O.S. Act ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) According to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]](CDC), each day in the United States more than 100 people die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle accidents.
:(2) The CDC reports that more than 38,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose in 2010 alone. Seventy-eight percent of these deaths were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have been prevented.
:(3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses increased more than 400 percent between 1980 and 1999, and more than doubled between 1999 and 2010.
:(4) Ninety-one percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the population of Non-Hispanic Whites and the population of American Indians and Alaska Natives have seen the highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning deaths.
:(5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone are involved in 55 percent of all unintentional drug poisoning deaths.
:(6) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and 265 percent among men.
:(7) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing a drug overdose. Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan veterans with combat injuries, post­trau­mat­ic stress disorder (PTSD), and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications.
:(8) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately affected by opioid medication overdoses. Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults.
:(9) In the year 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded $20,000,000,000.
:(10) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose fatalities.
:(11) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses overdose from heroin and opioid medications.
:(12) In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) held a public workshop in collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the CDC, and with participation from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), to discuss making naloxone more widely available outside of conventional medical settings to reduce the incidence of opioid overdose fatalities.
:(13) Lawmakers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia have removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to an overdose.
:(14) Health practitioners are often not fully aware of overdose symptoms and prevention methods, impacting their ability to adequately inform patients and caregivers on how to recognize symptoms, respond effectively by seeking emergency assistance, and provide naloxone and other first aid in order to save a life.
:(15) The American Medical Association (AMA), the Nation’s largest physician organization, supports further implementation of community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid overdose prevention services.
:(16) Community-based overdose prevention programs have successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making rescue trainings and naloxone available to first responders, parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. Over 50,000 potential bystanders have been trained by overdose prevention programs in the United States. A CDC report credits overdose prevention programs with saving more than 10,000 lives since 1996.
:(17) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are operating in the United States, including in major cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, Massachusetts, and New York. Between 2006 and 2009, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained nearly 3,000 people who reported more than 300 rescues. Since 2004, a program administered by the Baltimore City Health Department has trained more than 3,000 people who reported more than 220 rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose prevention program in Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 percent between 2009 and 2011.
:(18) The ONDCP supports equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted 170 overdose rescues with naloxone since 2010. The police department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk County, New York, police officers have saved more than 50 lives with naloxone.
:(19) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the range of what Americans usually pay for health treatments.
:(20) Overdose prevention programs are needed in correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing after a period of abstinence.
:(21) People affected by drug overdose gather each year in communities nationwide on August 31st for Overdose Awareness Day to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and raise awareness about overdose risk and prevention.
