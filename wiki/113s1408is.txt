=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The latest estimates of the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] of the incidence of new HIV infections in the United States indicate that HIV remains a serious health problem.
:(2) It has been estimated that 1.3 million people in the United States are living with HIV/AIDS. Approximately 50,000 people in the United States are newly infected and nearly one in five of those are not aware that they are infected.
:(3) Racial and ethnic minorities accounted for almost 71 percent of the newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection in 2010. The national HIV rates (per 100,000 persons) for minority groups as of 2010 was 68.9 for Blacks, 27.5 for Hispanics, 19.3 for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, 9.7 for American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 6.5 for Asian Americans.
:(4) Although Blacks are only 14 percent of the United States population, they account for half (44 percent) of all new HIV infection cases in 2010. They are 8.0 times more likely to have HIV than Whites.
:(5) Black women accounted for 13 percent of all new HIV infections in the United States in 2010 and nearly 64 percent of all new infections among women. Most black women (87 percent) were infected through heterosexual sex. In 2010, AIDS was the third leading cause of death in black women 35 to 44 years of age. This equates to the death rate from HIV of 22 times more likely than White women.
:(6) Black men represented almost one-third (31 percent) of all new HIV infections in the United States in 2010 and account for 70 percent of new HIV infections among Blacks. AIDS is also the third leading cause of death for Black men 35 to 44 years of age.
:(7) The rate of new HIV diagnoses among Black males 13 to 29 years of age who have sex with males has increased 48 percent between 2006 and 2009.
:(8) Second to Blacks, Hispanics compose the minority group most disproportionately affected by HIV. Accounting for 16 percent of the United States population, Hispanics account for 20 percent of all new HIV infections.
:(9) In 2010, Hispanic females are almost 5 times as likely to have AIDS as White females.
:(10) Over two-thirds of Asian Americans and over one-half of Pacific Islanders have never been tested for HIV. Asian Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders account for approximately one percent of HIV/AIDS cases nationally. Asian Americans have lower AIDS rates than their White counterparts and they are less likely to die of HIV/AIDS.
:(11) HIV/AIDS is the ninth leading cause of death in Asian and Pacific Island men aged 25 to 34.
:(12) Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders are 2.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV as compared to the White population. While Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders represent 0.4 percent of the total population in the United States, the AIDS case rate for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders was twice that of the White population in 2010.
:(13) American Indians/Alaska Natives have a 30 percent higher rate of HIV/AIDS infection as compared to the White population. In 2010, American Indian/Alaska Native females were three times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV infection, as compared to the White female population.
:(14) Runaway youth are 6 to 12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than other youth.
:(15) In August 2007, the National Medical Association, representing 30,000 African-American physicians, released a consensus report titled “Addressing the HIV/AIDS Crisis In The African American Community: Fact, Fiction and Policy” which specifically called on the next President of the United States to declare HIV/AIDS in African-American communities a public health emergency. The National Medical Association has worked with the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS (NBLCA) to organize clergy to advocate for the specific needs of Black physicians, their patients, and those at risk in African-American communities. Both organizations have pledged to advocate and work with clergy to develop, execute, and implement these initiatives in African-American communities and culture.
:(16) In October 2007, 186 Black clergy, consisting of Baptist, Church of God in Christ (COGIC), Methodist, Protestant, African Methodist Episcopal (AME), and Pentecostal faiths came together to participate in the National Black Clergy Conclave on HIV/AIDS Policy, hosted by Time Warner, Inc., with other foundation support. Included in this prestigious gathering were the Health Brain Trust of the Congressional Black Caucus, leaders from the National Conference of Black Mayors, and the National Caucus of Black State Legislators. This group developed a plan of action that has become the Communities United with Religious leaders to Eliminate HIV/AIDS in minority communities to respond to the “on the ground” emergency in prevention, care, and treatment for AIDS in Black America.
:(17) The National Black Clergy Conclave on HIV/AIDS declared the HIV/AIDS crisis in the African-American community a “public health emergency” . The National Conclave also recognized that HIV/AIDS is growing in and affecting other minority groups disproportionately. Therefore, the Conclave is collaborating with the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, a 30-year-old organization aimed at Hispanic health; the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum, a 27-year-old national organization focused on improving the health of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders; and the Asian-Pacific Islander Wellness Center and Esperanza, a Latino based national organization to end HIV/AIDS disparities within these racial and minority communities.
:(18) At their April 2008 annual meeting, the National Policy Alliance, consisting of the Joint Center For Political and Economic Studies (secretariat), the National Black Caucus of School Board Members, National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, the Judicial Council of the National Bar Association, the National Association of Black County Officials, Blacks in Government, National Conference of Black Mayors, and the World Council of Mayors voted unanimously to support, endorse, and encourage the passage of a bill that addresses the dramatic increase of HIV/AIDS in minority communities and to organize their respective members to endorse and support the passage of such a bill.
