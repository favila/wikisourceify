{{Center|A BILL}}

To amend the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 to increase public awareness about the dangers of synthetic drugs through the national youth antidrug media campaign.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Synthetics are Dangerous Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

The [[w:|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Synthetic drugs, sometimes referred to as designer drugs, are chemical compounds produced in clandestine laboratories to mimic or enhance the effects of schedule I controlled substances such as methamphetamine, ecstasy, and marijuana.
:(2) Given the lack of extensive medical research on many synthetic drugs and their various analogues, the full scope of their harmful effects is not well understood.
:(3) The circumstantial evidence of the harmful effects of synthetic drugs, particularly synthetic cannabinoids (such as “K2” and “spice” ) and synthetic stimulants (such as “bath salts” ) are, nevertheless, alarming—
::(A) in 2010, more than 11,000 individuals were admitted into the emergency room from complications arising from synthetic drug use, and nearly 25 percent of those patients required further medical treatment; and
::(B) in 2011, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported more than a two-fold increase in the number of calls related to synthetic marijuana from the previous year.
:(4) The harmful effects of ingesting synthetic drugs include but are not limited to agitation, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, tremor, seizures, hallucinations, paranoid behavior, and nonresponsiveness.
:(5) Like all schedule I drugs, these synthetic drugs are drugs that have a high potential for abuse, have no medical use in the United States, and lack an accepted safe use.
:(6) The passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012was an important step in reducing the access of teens and young adults to dangerous and addictive synthetic drugs.
:(7) New synthetic drugs are being manufactured that contain chemical compounds not found on schedule I, as set forth in section 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/812 21 U.S.C. 812(c)] ), that nevertheless mimic or enhance the effects of controlled substances like methamphetamine, marijuana, ecstasy, and LSD.
:(8) Hundreds, potentially thousands, of teens and young adults will be admitted into emergency rooms around the country from complications caused by the ingestion of the next breed of harmful, synthetic drugs.
:(9) It is the sense of the [[w:|Congress]] that there is an urgent need, particularly among teens, young adults, and parents, to raise awareness about the dangers of these new synthetic drugs.

=Sec. 3. Increasing public awareness of dangers of synthetic drugs through national youth antidrug media campaign=

 Section 709 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/1708 21 U.S.C. 1708] )is amended—
:(1) in subsection (a)(3), by inserting “and synthetic drug use” after “illegal drug use” ; and
:(2) by redesignating subsection (l)as subsection (m)and inserting after subsection (k) the following new subsection:

<blockquote>

===(l) Definitions– ===

For purposes of this section:

====(1) Drug– ====

The term “drug” has the meaning given such term in section 702(3)and includes a synthetic drug.

====(2) Synthetic drug– ====

The term “synthetic drug” means an artificially produced substance that, as determined by the [[w:Office of National Drug Control Policy|Director]] , is an analog or derivative of a controlled substance (as defined in section 102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/802 21 U.S.C. 802(6)] ), but is not itself a controlled substance..
