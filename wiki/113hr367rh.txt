{{Center|A BILL}}

 To amendchapter 8of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law.    

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“ Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Purpose=

The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the American people for the laws imposed upon them. 

=Sec. 3. Congressional review of agency rulemaking=

  Chapter 8of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:

<blockquote> 
:8 Congressional Review of Agency Rulemaking–  Sec. 801. Congressional review. 802. Congressional approval procedure for major rules. 803. Congressional disapproval procedure for nonmajor rules. 804. Definitions. 805. Judicial review. 806. Exemption for monetary policy. 807. Effective date of certain rules. 

==Sec. 801. Congressional review==

::(2) 
:::(A) The [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]]shall provide a report on each major rule to the committees of jurisdiction by the end of 15 calendar days after the submission or publication date. The report of the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]]shall include an assessment of the agency’s compliance with procedural steps required by[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/801 paragraph (1)(B)]and an assessment of whether the major rule imposes any new limits or mandates on private-sector activity.
:::(B) Federal agencies shall cooperate with the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]]by providing information relevant to the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General]]’s report under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/801 subparagraph (A)].

::(1) A major rule shall not take effect unless the Congress enacts a joint resolution of approval described under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 section 802].
::(2) If a joint resolution described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/801 subsection (a)]is not enacted into law by the end of 70 session days or legislative days, as applicable, beginning on the date on which the report referred to in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/801 section 801(a)(1)(A)]is received by Congress (excluding days either House of Congress is adjourned for more than 3 days during a session of Congress), then the rule described in that resolution shall be deemed not to be approved and such rule shall not take effect.

:::(D) issued pursuant to any statute implementing an international trade agreement.

:::(A) in the case of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]], 60 session days, or
:::(B) in the case of the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], 60 legislative days,before the date the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]is scheduled to adjourn a session of Congress through the date on which the same or succeeding Congress first convenes its next session,[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 sections 802]and[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/803 803]shall apply to such rule in the succeeding session of Congress.

::(3) A rule described under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/801 paragraph (1)]shall take effect as otherwise provided by law (including other subsections of this section).

:(c) In the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]], if the committee or committees to which a joint resolution described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 subsection (a)]has been referred have not reported it at the end of 15 session days after its introduction, such committee or committees shall be automatically discharged from further consideration of the resolution and it shall be placed on the calendar. A vote on final passage of the resolution shall be taken on or before the close of the 15th session day after the resolution is reported by the committee or committees to which it was referred, or after such committee or committees have been discharged from further consideration of the resolution.
:(d) 
::(1) In the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]], when the committee or committees to which a joint resolution is referred have reported, or when a committee or committees are discharged (under[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 subsection (c)]) from further consideration of a joint resolution described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 subsection (a)], it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution, and all points of order against the joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived.

:(e) In the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], if any committee to which a joint resolution described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 subsection (a)]has been referred has not reported it to the House at the end of 15 legislative days after its introduction, such committee shall be discharged from further consideration of the joint resolution, and it shall be placed on the appropriate calendar. On the second and fourth Thursdays of each month it shall be in order at any time for the [[w:United States House of Representatives|Speaker]]to recognize a Member who favors passage of a joint resolution that has appeared on the calendar for at least 5 legislative days to call up that joint resolution for immediate consideration in the House without intervention of any point of order. When so called up a joint resolution shall be considered as read and shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and the previous question shall be considered as ordered to its passage without intervening motion. It shall not be in order to reconsider the vote on passage. If a vote on final passage of the joint resolution has not been taken by the third Thursday on which the [[w:United States House of Representatives|Speaker]]may recognize a Member under this subsection, such vote shall be taken on that day.
:(f) 
::(1) If, before passing a joint resolution described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 subsection (a)], one House receives from the other a joint resolution having the same text, then—
:::(A) the joint resolution of the other House shall not be referred to a committee; and
:::(B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be the same as if no joint resolution had been received from the other House until the vote on passage, when the joint resolution received from the other House shall supplant the joint resolution of the receiving House.
::(2) This subsection shall not apply to the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]if the joint resolution received from the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]is a revenue measure.
:(g) If either House has not taken a vote on final passage of the joint resolution by the last day of the period described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/801 section 801(b)(2)], then such vote shall be taken on that day.
:(h) This section and[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/803 section 803]are enacted by [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]—
::(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such is deemed to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a joint resolution described in[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/802 subsection (a)]and superseding other rules only where explicitly so; and
::(2) with full recognition of the Constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.
