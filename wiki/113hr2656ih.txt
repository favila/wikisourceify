{{Center|A BILL}}

To enhance public safety by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal prison system with offender risk and needs assessment, individual risk reduction incentives and rewards, and risk and recidivism reduction.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Public Safety Enhancement Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Purposes=

The purposes of the Act are to—
:(1) enhance public safety by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Federal prison system, and to reduce the recidivism rates of Federal offenders;
:(2) establish offender risk and needs assessment as the cornerstone of a more effective and efficient Federal prison system;
:(3) implement a validated post-sentencing risk and needs assessment system that relies on dynamic risk factors to provide Federal prison officials with a roadmap to address the individual criminogenic needs of Federal offenders, manage limited resources, and enhance public safety;
:(4) enhance existing recidivism reduction programs and prison jobs by incentivizing Federal prisoners to reduce their individual risk of recidivism by participating and successfully completing such programs, and by satisfactorily holding such jobs over time;
:(5) reward Federal prisoners who actually reduce their individual risk of recidivism by providing them with the ability to earn and accrue time credits, and to transfer into prerelease custody when they are assessed as low risk and have earned sufficient time credits;
:(6) expand the implementation of evidence-based intervention and treatment programs designed to reduce recidivism, including educational and vocational training programs, and prison jobs, so all Federal prisoners have access to them during their entire terms of incarceration;
:(7) perform regular outcome evaluations of programs and interventions to assure that they are evidence-based and to suggest changes, deletions, and expansions based on the results; and
:(8) assist the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to address the underlying cost structure of the Federal prison system and ensure that the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department]] can continue to run our prisons safely and securely without compromising the scope or quality of the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department’s]] many other critical law enforcement missions.

=Sec. 4. Post-sentencing risk and needs assessment system=



==(a) In general– ==

Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall develop and release for use by the [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bureau of Prisons]] an offender risk and needs assessment system, to be known as the Post-Sentencing Risk and Needs Assessment System (referred to in this Act as the System ), which shall provide risk and needs assessment tools (developed under subsection (b)) in order to, for each prisoner—
:(1) classify the recidivism risk level of prisoners as low, moderate, or high as part of the intake process, and assign the prisoner to appropriate recidivism reduction programs or productive activities based on that classification, the prisoner’s specific needs, and in accordance with subsection (c);
:(2) reassess the recidivism risk level of prisoners periodically, and reassign the prisoner to appropriate recidivism reduction programs or productive activities based on the revised classification, the specific needs of the prisoner, and the successful completion of recidivism reduction programs in accordance with subsection (d); and
:(3) determine when a prisoner who has been classified as having a low recidivism risk level is ready to transfer into prerelease custody in accordance with subsection (d).

==(b) Risk and needs assessment tools– ==



===(1) In general– ===

The [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall develop the risk and needs assessment tools to be used in the System developed under subsection (a)by using the research and data analysis conducted under section 3(b)(3)on the best available risk and needs assessment tools available as of the date of the enactment of this Act, and determining, using the methods described in section 3(c), how to make the most effective and efficient tools to accomplish for each prisoner, the assessments described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a).

===(2) Use of existing risk and needs assessment tools permitted– ===

In carrying out this subsection, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] may determine that the best available risk and needs assessment tools available as of the date of the enactment of this Act are sufficiently effective and efficient for the purpose of accomplishing for each prisoner, the assessments described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a), and may determine that those are the tools to be used in the System instead of developing new tools.

In carrying out this subsection, the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] shall statistically validate any tools that the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] selects for use in the System on the Federal prison population, or ensure that the tools have been so validated.

==(c) Assignment of recidivism reduction programs– ==

The System shall provide guidance on the kind and amount of recidivism reduction programming or productive activities that should be assigned for each classification of prisoner and shall provide—
:(1) that the higher the risk level of a prisoner, the more programming the prisoner shall participate in;
:(2) information on the best ways that the [[w:Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bureau of Prisons]] can tailor the programs to the specific needs of each prisoner so as to best lower each prisoner’s risk of recidivating; and

=====(3) Prisoners with a low risk of recidivating– =====

In the case of a prisoner that has been classified under the Post-Sentencing Risk and Needs Assessment System developed under the Public Safety Enhancement Act of 2013as having a low risk of recidivating, has earned time credits in an amount that is equal to the remainder of the prisoner’s imposed term of imprisonment, and has been classified by the warden of the prison as otherwise qualified to be transferred into prerelease custody, the following shall apply:
:(A) The warden of the prison shall submit a recommendation that the prisoner be transferred into prerelease custody to the United States district court in which the prisoner was convicted, and a judge for such court shall, not later than 30 days after the warden submits such recommendation, approve or deny the recommendation; however, a judge may only deny a recommendation to transfer a prisoner into prerelease custody under this paragraph if the judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that the prisoner should not be transferred into prerelease custody based only on evidence of the prisoner’s actions after the conviction of such prisoner and not based on evidence from the underlying conviction, and submits a detailed written statement regarding such finding to the warden of the prison recommending that the prisoner be transferred into prerelease custody.
:(B) The failure of a judge to approve or deny a recommendation to transfer at the end of the 30 day period described in [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3624 subparagraph (A)] shall be treated as an approval of such recommendation.
:(C) Upon the approval of a recommendation under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3624 subparagraph (A)] or 30 days after the warden submits a recommendation, whichever occurs earlier, the prisoner shall be placed in home confinement, provided that the prisoner will be able to stay in a residence that the warden approves, and the time limits under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3624 paragraphs (1)] and [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3624 (2)] shall not apply.
:(D) The prisoner shall remain in home confinement until the prisoner has served not less than 85 percent of the prisoner’s imposed term of imprisonment.
:(E) The warden shall use the guidelines developed by the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Attorney General]] under section 4(d)(2)(C) of the Public Safety Enhancement Act of 2013to determine the level of supervision and consequences for certain actions for a prisoner transferred into prerelease custody under this paragraph..
