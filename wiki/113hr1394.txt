=={{anchor|HC9AE9B6A0CE644DEBD7DBE9C59CD4FBC}}Sec. 44. Quadrennial Strategic Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy==



==={{anchor|HE7240F6212B14D9DAE519645009D8CD5}}(a) In general– ===


:(1) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] (hereafter in this section referred to as Secretary ), in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] with regard to lands administered by the [[w:United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] , shall develop and publish every 4 years a Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy. This Strategy shall direct Federal land energy development and department resource allocation in order to promote the energy and national security of the United States in accordance with [[w:Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management’s]] mission of promoting the multiple use of Federal lands as set forth in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/1701 43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] ).
:(2) In developing this Strategy, the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall consult with the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Administrator of the Energy Information Administration]] on the projected energy demands of the United States for the next 30-year period, and how energy derived from Federal onshore lands can put the United States on a trajectory to meet that demand during the next 4-year period. The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall consider how Federal lands will contribute to ensuring national energy security, with a goal for increasing energy independence and production, during the next 4-year period.
:(3) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall determine a domestic strategic production objective for the development of energy resources from Federal onshore lands. Such objective shall be—
::(A) the best estimate, based upon commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic production of oil and natural gas from the Federal onshore mineral estate, with a focus on lands held by the [[w:Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]] and the [[w:United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] ;
::(B) the best estimate, based upon commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic coal production from Federal lands;
::(C) the best estimate, based upon commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic production of strategic and critical energy minerals from the Federal onshore mineral estate;
::(D) the best estimate, based upon commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in megawatts for electricity production from each of the following sources: wind, solar, biomass, hydropower, and geothermal energy produced on Federal lands administered by the [[w:Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]] and the [[w:United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] ;
::(E) the best estimate, based upon commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in unconventional energy production, such as oil shale;
::(F) the best estimate, based upon commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in domestic production of oil, natural gas, coal, and other renewable sources from tribal lands for any federally recognized Indian tribe that elects to participate in facilitating energy production on its lands; and
::(G) the best estimate, based upon commercial and scientific data, of the expected increase in production of helium on Federal lands administered by the [[w:Bureau of Land Management|Bureau of Land Management]] and the [[w:United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] .
:(4) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall consult with the [[w:Energy Information Administration|Administrator of the Energy Information Administration]] regarding the methodology used to arrive at its estimates for purposes of this section.
:(5) The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] has the authority to expand the energy development plan to include other energy production technology sources or advancements in energy on Federal lands.

==={{anchor|H4CD2D8D4EB3841078995D17F582E67A6}}(b) Tribal objectives– ===

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that federally recognized Indian tribes may elect to set their own production objectives as part of the Strategy under this section. The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall work in cooperation with any federally recognized Indian tribe that elects to participate in achieving its own strategic energy objectives designated under this subsection.

==={{anchor|HA9936C46B2E84840A2BD1C00680F625E}}(c) Execution of the Strategy– ===

The relevant [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall have all necessary authority to make determinations regarding which additional lands will be made available in order to meet the production objectives established by strategies under this section. The [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall also take all necessary actions to achieve these production objectives unless the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] determines that it is not in the national security and economic interests of the United States to increase Federal domestic energy production and to further decrease dependence upon foreign sources of energy. In administering this section, the relevant [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary]] shall only consider leasing Federal lands available for leasing at the time the lease sale occurs.

==={{anchor|H3EA2F608CFB24F219EF8902A8C9200FF}}(d) State, federally recognized Indian tribes, local government, and public input– ===
