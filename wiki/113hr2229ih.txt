{{Center|A BILL}}

To require the Commissioner of Social Security to issue uniform standards for the method for truncation of Social Security account numbers in order to protect such numbers from being used in the perpetration of fraud or identity theft and to provide for a prohibition on the display to the general public on the Internet of Social Security account numbers by State and local governments and private entities, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Safeguarding Social Security Numbers Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:|Congress]] makes the following findings:
:(1) The Federal Government requires virtually every individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a Social Security account number in order to pay taxes or to qualify for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act.
:(2) Many Government agencies and private entities also use Social Security account numbers as identifiers to track individual records or as information that an individual must present to verify his or her identity. Thus, Social Security account numbers are routinely collected, recorded, and transferred by public and private entities.
:(3) As an unintended consequence of these uses, Social Security account numbers have become one of the tools that can be used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned.
:(4) According to the [[w:|Social Security Administration’s Inspector General]] , 16 percent of the 99,000 fraud cases it investigated in the 1-year period ending September 30, 2006, involved the misuse of Social Security account numbers.
:(5) The Social Security account number is also a key piece of information used in the perpetration of identity theft. In calendar year 2006, over 240,000 individuals reported to the [[w:Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission]] that they had been the victims of an identity theft. Identity theft is a serious crime that can cause substantial financial losses and force victims to spend significant time restoring the accuracy of their credit records.
:(6) Social Security account numbers are publicly displayed by some Government entities. In most jurisdictions throughout the United States, State and local law requires that certain documentary records, such as business filings, property records, and birth and marriage certificates, be made available to the general public. Some of these records contain personally identifiable information of individuals, including Social Security account numbers. Increasingly, State and local recordkeepers are displaying public records on the Internet, where these records are widely accessible at no cost or for a minimal fee. There are known instances of criminals using personally identifiable information from online public records to commit identity theft.
:(7) Private information resellers also routinely record and transfer individuals’ Social Security account numbers and other personally identifiable information. In a 2006 study, the [[w:|Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) was able to purchase truncated or full Social Security account numbers from 5 of 21 Internet information resellers that were surveyed.
:(8) The [[w:|GAO]] has concluded, based on available evidence, that unauthorized access to personal data such as Social Security account numbers is a frequent occurrence. A survey of 17 Federal agencies by the [[w:United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives]] found that these agencies suffered more than 788 data breaches from January 2003 through July 2006.
:(9) In many instances, public and private entities seek to protect Social Security account numbers from abuse by truncating a portion of each number. However, because truncation methods are not uniform, it is possible to obtain a full Social Security account number by reconstructing the number based on partial information obtained from different sources.
:(10) In a report issued in June 2007, the [[w:|GAO]] found that truncated Social Security account numbers in Federal documents stored as public records remain vulnerable to misuse, in part because different truncation methods used by the public and private sectors permit the reconstruction of full Social Security account numbers. Federal entities such as the [[w:United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] , the [[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] , and the Judicial Conference of the United States truncate by displaying the last 4 digits of the Social Security account number. In contrast, the [[w:|GAO]] found that information resellers sometimes sell records containing Social Security account numbers that are truncated to display the first 5 digits.
:(11) The first 5 digits of an individual’s Social Security account number are assigned based on the location in which the account number was issued and the order in which the account number was issued. The last 4 digits of an individual’s Social Security account number are randomly generated, creating a unique account number for each individual. Many public and private entities ask consumers to supply the last 4 digits of Social Security account numbers as a way to verify consumers’ identities, providing an additional reason for identity thieves to seek to acquire these digits.
:(12) The [[w:|GAO]] reported in 2006 that it had been unable to identify any industry standards or guidelines for truncating Social Security account numbers. Moreover, the [[w:|GAO]] could not identify any consensus among Government officials about which method for truncation better protects Social Security account numbers from abuse.
:(13) The [[w:|GAO]] has stated that standardizing the truncation of Social Security account numbers would better protect these numbers from misuse. Since 2005, the GAO has on multiple occasions recommended the establishment of uniform standards for truncation of Social Security account numbers.
:(14) Given the [[w:Social Security Administration|Social Security Administration’s]] role in assigning Social Security account numbers, the Commissioner of Social Security may be in the best position to determine whether and how truncation should be standardized.
:(15) The truncation of Social Security account numbers, even by Federal Government agencies, is not comprehensively required or regulated. Currently, the [[w:Social Security Administration|Social Security Administration]] does not have the legal authority to regulate the use of Social Security account numbers by other entities.
:(16) Because the Federal Government created and maintains the system of required Social Security account numbers, and because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to take steps to curb the abuse of Social Security account numbers.

=Sec. 3. Requirement to issue uniform standards for the method for truncation of Social Security account numbers=



==(a) In general– ==

The [[w:Social Security Administration|Commissioner of Social Security]] shall issue uniform standards—
:(1) for the method for truncation of Social Security account numbers in order to facilitate the protection of such numbers from being used in the perpetration of fraud or identity theft; and

::(ii) The risk that the numerical digits not masked in the truncation process will reveal personally identifiable information about an individual.
::(iii) The risk that a truncated Social Security account number can be used to derive or acquire from other sources a full Social Security account number.
:(B) The methods in use for the truncation of Social Security account numbers by the Federal Government, State and local governments, and private entities and the extent of use of each method by the Federal Government, State and local governments, and private entities.
:(C) The reasons why Social Security account numbers are collected and recorded by the Federal Government, State and local governments, and private entities.
:(D) The effect of each proposed method for truncation on the uses for Social Security account numbers by the Federal Government, State and local governments, and private entities.
