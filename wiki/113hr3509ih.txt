{{Center|A BILL}}

To direct the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a report on the status of post-earthquake recovery and development efforts in Haiti.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an estimated 316,000 people dead, including 103 United States citizens, 101 United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent of the nation’s civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 115,000 homes destroyed, and 2,000,000 people displaced.
:(2) According to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the Government of Haiti, with technical assistance from the United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the European Commission, an estimated 15 percent of the population were directly affected by the disaster and related damages and economic losses totaled $7,804,000,000.
:(3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti had some of the lowest socioeconomic indicators and the second highest rate of income disparity in the world, conditions that have further complicated post-earthquake recovery efforts and, according to the World Bank, have significantly reduced the prospects of economic growth spurring broader poverty reduction.
:(4) Today, according to the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] , the Government of Haiti, Haitian civil society, and international nongovernmental organizations, more than 8,000,000 people in Haiti, out of a population of approximately 10,000,000, continue to struggle to meet their food security needs as a result of the earthquake, tropical storms and hurricanes, rising global food prices, and long term neglect of the agricultural sector.
:(5) In October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of cholera in Haiti resulted in over half a million reported cases and over 8,000 deaths to date, further straining the capacity of Haiti’s public health sector and increasing the urgency of resettlement and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) efforts.
:(6) The international community, led by the United States and the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian response in Haiti, with donors pledging approximately $14,000,000,000 for humanitarian relief and recovery efforts, including debt relief, supplemented by $3,100,000,000 in private charitable contributions, of which approximately $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed and an additional $3,800,000,000 has been committed as of September 30, 2013.
:(7) The emergency response of the men and women of the United States Government, led by the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the United States Southern Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United States, was particularly swift and resolute.
:(8) Since 2010, a total of $1,300,000,000 in United States assistance has been allocated for humanitarian relief and $2,300,000,000 has been allocated for recovery, reconstruction, and development assistance in Haiti, including $1,140,000,000 in emergency appropriations and $95,000,000 that has been obligated specifically to respond to the cholera epidemic.
:(9) Of the $3,600,000,000 in United States assistance allocated for Haiti, $651,000,000 was apportioned to the [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] to support an ambitious recovery plan, including the construction of a power plant to provide electricity for the new Caracol Industrial Park (CIP) in northern Haiti, a new port near the CIP, and permanent housing in new settlements in the Port-au-Prince, St-Marc, and Cap-Haïtien areas.
:(10) On October 9, 2013, the [[w:United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives]] held an oversight hearing on the status and effectiveness of post-earthquake United States aid to Haiti, following a House of Representatives-mandated, year-long [[w:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) report that was highly critical of some aspects of USAID’s recovery effort.
:(11) According to [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] , as of June 30, 2013, [[w:United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] had disbursed just 35 percent of its reconstruction funds in Haiti, the port project was 2 years behind schedule and over budget by an estimated $189,000,000, the housing project has been reduced by 80 percent, and the sustainability of the power plant, the port, and the housing projects were all at risk.
:(12)  [[w:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] further found that [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] has not been provided with sufficient information to ensure that it is able to conduct effective oversight at a time when most funding remains to be disbursed, and specifically recommends that a periodic reporting mechanism be instituted to fill this information gap.
:(13) Donors have encountered significant challenges in implementing recovery programs and nearly 4 years after the earthquake an estimated 279,000 people remain displaced in camps, unemployment remains high, corruption is rampant, land rights remain elusive, allegations of wage violations are widespread, the business climate is unfavorable, and government capacity remains weak.
:(14) For Haiti to achieve stability and long term economic growth, donor assistance will have to be carefully coordinated with a commitment by the Haitian Government to transparency, a market economy, rule of law, and democracy.

=Sec. 3. Statement of policy=
