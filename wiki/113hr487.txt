      Medicare primary care graduate medical education pilot project 

        (a)
        Establishment
        The 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]]
             (in this section referred to as the Secretary) shall conduct a pilot project under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to test models for providing payment under such title for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education to medical education entities, which entities are not otherwise eligible to receive such payments under the Medicare program, for the costs of training primary care residents.
       

        (b)
        Duration
        The 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             shall conduct the pilot project under this section over a 5-year period, which shall begin not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
       

        (c)
        Models 

          (1)
          Required models
          Under the pilot project, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             shall test two of each of the following models: 

            (A)
            A model in which the medical education entity receiving funds under the pilot project is a community-based independent corporate entity collaborating with two or more hospitals to operate one or more primary care graduate medical residency training programs.
           

            (B)
            A model in which— 

              (i)
              the medical education entity receiving funds under the pilot project is established by two or more hospitals to operate one or more primary care graduate medical residency training programs; and
             

              (ii)
              such hospitals may be the sole corporate members of the entity but the governing board of the entity shall include at least one community representative.
            
           

            (C)
            A model in which the medical education entity receiving funds under the pilot project is a hospital subsidiary or independent corporation that operates one or more primary care graduate medical residency training programs for a hospital with community participation in the governance of the subsidiary or corporation.
           

            (D)
            A model in which— 

              (i)
              the medical education entity receiving funds under the pilot project is independent of any hospital but collaborates with a hospital in operating one or more primary care graduate medical residency training programs; and
             

              (ii)
              the medical education entity may include a university or school of medicine.
            
          
         

          (2)
          Additional models
          Under the pilot project, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             may test models of medical education entities in addition to those described in paragraph (1).
        
       

        (d)
        Prioritization
        Under the pilot project, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]]
             may give priority to testing models that demonstrate the capability of improving the quality, quantity, and distribution of primary care physicians, including the ability to enhance primary care delivery in rural and underserved areas.
       

        (e)
        Payments 

          (1)
          Payments to medical education entities
          Under the pilot project, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             shall establish a process under which payments are made to each medical education entity participating under such project for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education costs with respect to primary care residents enrolled under a primary care graduate medical residency training program operated pursuant to a model of such entity under subsection (c) instead of any payment or adjustment that would otherwise be made to a participant hospital (as defined in subsection (m)) of such entity for indirect and direct graduate medical education costs under 
              subsections (d)(5)(B) and (h) of section 1886 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) during the period of participation of such entity in such project.
         

          (2)
          Calculation of payments
          Payments to a medical education entity under the pilot project, with respect to a primary care graduate medical education residency program, for a cost reporting period during which the entity is participating in such pilot shall be, based on the most recently available data with respect to a previous cost reporting period, equal to the sum of the following: 

            (A)
            Direct GME
            The amount that, out of all of the payment amounts (determined on a per resident basis) received by hospitals under 
                section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)) for such previous cost reporting period, is equal to the 95th percentile of such payment amounts.
           

            (B)
            Indirect GME
            The amount that, out of all of the additional payment amounts (determined on a per resident basis) received by hospitals under 
                section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(B)) for such previous cost reporting period, is equal to the 95th percentile of such payment amounts.
          
         

          (3)
          Additional payments for programs serving underserved areas
          Payments in addition to the payments described in paragraph (2) may be made under the pilot project for primary care graduate medical residency training programs that—

            (B)
            change their training sites to include those areas.
          
         

          (4)
          Payments from Medicare Trust Funds
          In providing for such payments under this subsection to medical education entities, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             shall provide for an allocation of such payments between part A and part B (and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under 
              section 1817 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under 
              section 1841 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395t)) in the same manner as the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             provides for an allocation of payments under 
              subsections (d)(5)(B) and (h), respectively, of section 1886 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww).
        
       

        (f)
        Uses of payments 

          (1)
          In general

          (2)
          Limitations
          Payments shall only be made for training primary care residents up to the initial board certification of such residents, except that with respect to training in geriatric medicine, payments may also be made for a fellowship after initial board certification.
        
       

        (g)
        Expansion during pilot project
        A medical education entity receiving funds under the pilot project, with respect to a primary care graduate medical residency training program, shall be allowed to increase by up to 50 percent the number of full-time equivalent primary care residents enrolled in the such program (determined in accordance with the process under subsection (e)(1)) during the duration of the participation of such entity in such project.
       

        (h)
        Treatment after project 

          (1)
          In general
          Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), after the last day of the pilot project, which may be extended at the discretion of the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
            , any participant hospital of a medical education entity under the pilot project, shall receive payments under 
              subsection (d)(5)(B) and (h) of section 1886 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) in the same manner and to the same extent such hospital would receive such payments without application of this Act and such payments shall be calculated based on the number of full-time equivalent residents enrolled in such program without regard to any increase made pursuant to subsection (g).
         

          (2)
          Exception to ensure residents enrolled during pilot are able to complete training
          Subject to paragraph (3), a medical education entity receiving funds under the pilot project, with respect to a primary care graduate medical residency training program, shall continue to receive funding under this section (even after the last day of the project), with respect to each primary care resident who is enrolled under such program while the entity is participating in such project, to the extent and in such amounts necessary to allow for the full duration of training, subject to subsection (f)(2), of such primary care resident. Any such payments made pursuant to this subparagraph shall be deemed to be a payment made under the pilot project.
         

          (3)
          Limitation
          In no case may the total duration of the pilot project exceed seven years and in no case may payments be made under this section to a medical education entity for a period exceeding seven years.

                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             shall reduce payments under 
            subsections (d)(5)(B) and (h) of section 1886 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) by such amount as the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             determines to be necessary to ensure that carrying out the pilot project under this section during such year does not result in expenditures under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for such year that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made for such year without application of this section.
       

        (j)
        Waiver authority
        The 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             may waive such requirements of titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of the pilot project under this section.
       

        (k)
        Report to Congress
        The 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]

          (2)
          recommendations on the extent to which the pilot project should be expanded to all primary care residents; and
         

          (3)
          recommendations for such legislation and administrative actions as needed.
        
       

        (l)
        Expansion
        If the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             determines that any of the models tested under the pilot project under this section enhance the quality, quantity, and distribution of primary care physicians for Medicare beneficiaries, the 
                [[Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]
             may initiate comparable primary care training projects.
