{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the possible easing of restrictions on the sale of lethal military equipment to the Government of Vietnam.   

= =

That it is the sense of the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]]thatâ€”
:(1) Vietnam is an important emerging partner with which the United States increasingly shares strategic and economic interests, including improving bilateral and multilateral capacity for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, upholding the principles of freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of international disputes, strengthening an open regional trading order, and maintaining a favorable balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region;
:(2) the Government of Vietnam has recently taken modest but encouraging steps to improve its human rights record, including signing the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the [[w:United Nations|United Nations General Assembly]]December 10, 1984, increasing registrations for places of worship, taking greater action to combat human trafficking, reviewing the Criminal Code, and beginning high-level engagement with the United States and international human rights nongovernmental organizations;
:(3) in light of growing challenges in the Asia-Pacific region and some steps by the Government of Vietnam to improve its human rights record, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]should begin a process to ease the United States prohibition on the sale of lethal military equipment to Vietnam, which is maintained under executive authority and can be changed without legislative action, but should not be changed without consultation with [[w:United States Congress|Congress]];
:(4) easing the prohibition on the sale of lethal military equipment to Vietnam at this time solely with regard to maritime and coastal defense would further United States national security interests, but steps beyond this to ease further the prohibition would require the Government of Vietnam to take significant and sustained steps to protect human rights, including releases of prisoners of conscience and legal reforms;
:(5) the United States Government should continue to support civil society in Vietnam, including advocates for religious freedom, press freedom, and labor rights who seek to use peaceful means to build a strong and prosperous Vietnam that respects human rights and the rule of law; and
:(6) the United States Government should continue to engage the Government of Vietnam in a high-level dialogue and specify what steps on human rights would be necessary for the Government of Vietnam to take in order to continue strengthening the bilateral relationship, including to ease further the prohibition on the sale of lethal military equipment.
