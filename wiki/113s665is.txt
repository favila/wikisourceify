If the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] finds that the State agency has failed to remedy such deficiencies within the time period specified by the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] and that the State plan continues to fail to comply substantially with a provision of the State plan, the [[w:United States Department of Labor|Secretary]] shall withdraw the State plan as provided for in paragraph (3).; and
