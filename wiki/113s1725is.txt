::(II) all positions in futures contracts and options on futures contracts held in a portfolio margining account carried as a securities account pursuant to a portfolio margining program approved by the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] , including all property collateralizing such positions, to the extent that such property is not otherwise included herein; minus
:(ii) any indebtedness of such customer to the debtor on the filing date; plus
:(iii) any payment by such customer of such indebtedness to the debtor which is made with the approval of the trustee and within such period as the trustee may determine (but in no event more than sixty days after the publication of notice under section 8(a)).

====(B) Treatment of certain commodity futures contracts– ====

A claim for a commodity futures contract received, acquired, or held in a portfolio margining account pursuant to a portfolio margining program approved by the [[w:U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Commission]] or a claim for a security futures contract, shall be deemed to be a claim with respect to such contract as of the filing date, and such claim shall be treated as a claim for cash.

====(C) Treatment of accounts held by a customer in separate capacities– ====

In determining net equity under this paragraph, accounts held by a customer in separate capacities shall be deemed to be accounts of separate customers.

====(D) Reliance on final customer statement– ====



=====(i) In general– =====

In determining net equity under this paragraph, the positions, options, and contracts of a customer reported to the customer as held by the debtor, and any indebtedness of the customer to the debtor, shall be determined based on—

:(II) any additional written confirmations of the customer’s positions, options, contracts, or indebtedness received after such last statement but before the filing date.

=====(ii) Exception when debtor’s records indicate higher value– =====

Notwithstanding clause (i), if the books and records of the debtor indicate that the net value of a customer’s positions, options, and contracts reported to the customer as held by the debtor, and any indebtedness of the customer to the debtor, is greater than the net value of the customer as calculated under clause (i)using the customer’s last statement, then the determination of the net equity of the customer under this paragraph shall be done using the books and records of the debtor instead of the customer’s last statement.

=====(iii) Fraud exception– =====

The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to any customer that—
:(I) knew the debtor was involved in fraudulent activity with respect to any customer of the debtor which reasonably indicated a fraud adversely affecting a substantial number of customers; or

:::(AA) as a broker or dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or
:::(BB) as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or that would have been required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940but for section 203(m)of such Act;

:(i) if the trustee determines that it is necessary in order to reach a fair and reasonable result, is determined without regard to section 16(11)(D);
