      Purposes
      The purposes of this Act are as
			 follows:
			
        (1)
        To remedy the inequitable distribution of
			 State and local funds within the areas served by local educational
			 agencies.
			
      
        (2)
        To reinforce the
			 supplementary intent of funds made available under title I of the 
            Elementary
			 and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), ensuring that
			 these funds serve their original purpose of subsidizing the increased costs
			 associated with educating students in concentrated poverty.
			
      
        (3)
        To address the
			 statutory, regulatory, and enforcement weaknesses that have undermined the role
			 of the comparability requirement in ensuring comparability within school
			 districts.
			
      
        (4)
        To require the
			 inclusion of real teacher salaries in calculations of per-pupil
			 expenditures.
			
      
        (5)
        To provide
			 sufficient transparency, accountability, and disclosure to allow parents,
			 communities, educators, and local agency officials to ensure students have
			 access to the resources they need to achieve at high levels.

      Comparability of
			 Expenditures
      
        
          Section 1120A(c)
			 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6321(c)) is
			 amended to read as follows:
			
				
          (c)
          Comparability of
				Expenditures
					
            (1)
            In
				general
						
              (A)
              Comparable
				funding in general
              Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5),
				a local educational agency may receive funds under this part for a fiscal year
				only if, for the preceding fiscal year, the average expenditure per pupil of
				State and local funds in each school served under this part was at least 97
				percent of the average expenditure per pupil of State and local funds across
				all schools served by the local educational agency that are not receiving funds
				under this part.
						
            
              (B)
              Comparable
				funding among title i schools
              In any case where all of the
				schools served by a local educational agency receive support under this part,
				such agency may receive funds under this part for a fiscal year only if, for
				the preceding fiscal year, the average expenditure per pupil of State and local
				funds in each higher poverty school is at least 97 percent of the average
				expenditure per pupil of State and local funds across all lower poverty
				schools.
						
          
          
            (2)
            Equivalence
            A
				local educational agency shall be considered to have met the requirements of
				paragraph (1), and to be eligible to receive funds under this part, if—
						
              (A)
              such agency has
				filed with the State educational agency current school-by-school listing of
				per-pupil expenditures of State and local funds for each school served by the
				agency for the preceding fiscal year; and
						
            
              (B)
              the listing described in subparagraph (A)
				demonstrates comparability across schools as required by subparagraph (A) or
				(B) of paragraph (1).
						
          
          
            (3)
            Basis
            A local educational agency may meet the
				requirements of paragraph (1) across all schools or among schools serving a
				particular grade span, if the local educational agency compares schools within
				not more than three grade spans.
					
          
            (4)

              (A)

				issue regulations concerning State educational agencies’ and local educational
				agencies’ responsibilities for meeting the requirements of this
				subsection.
						
            
              (B)
              Regulations by
				States
              Not later than 6
				months after the date on which the regulations required under subparagraph (A)
				are issued, each State educational agency receiving funds under this part shall
				create and distribute to local educational agencies, and make available to the
				public, regulations on the responsibilities of local educational agencies for
				meeting the requirements of this subsection.
						
            
              (C)
              Plan by local
				educational agencies
              Not later than 14 months after the date on
				which regulations required by subparagraph (B) are distributed, each local
				educational agency receiving funds under this part shall develop and submit to
				the State educational agency a plan, including a timeline and annual
				benchmarks, that will ensure comparability as described in paragraph (1) not
				later than 3 years after the date on which such regulations are distributed.
				The plan shall be made available to the public.
						
            
              (D)

				subsection shall not apply to a local educational agency that does not have

            (6)
            Compliance
            For
				the purpose of determining compliance with paragraph (1), a local educational
				agency—

				school for programs that meet the intent and purpose of this part.
						
          
          
            (7)
