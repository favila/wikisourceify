The purposes of this Act are as follows:
:(1) To remedy the inequitable distribution of State and local funds within the areas served by local educational agencies.
:(2) To reinforce the supplementary intent of funds made available under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965([http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/6301 20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] ), ensuring that these funds serve their original purpose of subsidizing the increased costs associated with educating students in concentrated poverty.
:(3) To address the statutory, regulatory, and enforcement weaknesses that have undermined the role of the comparability requirement in ensuring comparability within school districts.
:(4) To require the inclusion of real teacher salaries in calculations of per-pupil expenditures.
:(5) To provide sufficient transparency, accountability, and disclosure to allow parents, communities, educators, and local agency officials to ensure students have access to the resources they need to achieve at high levels.
