=Sec. 2. Congressional findings and declarations of policy=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Defined benefit pension plans are a cost-effective way for cooperative associations and charities to provide their employees with economic security in retirement.
:(2) Many cooperative associations and charitable organizations are only able to provide their employees with defined benefit pension plans because those organizations are able to pool their resources using the multiple employer plan structure.
:(3) The pension funding rules should encourage cooperative associations and charities to continue to provide their employees with pension benefits.
