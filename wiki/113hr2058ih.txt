To improve and enhance research and programs on childhood cancer survivorship, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Childhood Cancer Survivors’ Quality of Life Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) An estimated 13,500 children and adolescents under age 20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.
:(2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer survived more than 5 years, but today, cure rates have increased to over 80 percent for children and adolescents under age 20.
:(3) The population of survivors of childhood cancers has grown dramatically, to over 360,000 individuals of all ages as of 2012.
:(4) As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, with as many as one-fourth experiencing a late effect that is serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, car­dio­pulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and secondary malignancies.
:(5) As a result of disparities in the delivery of cancer care, minority, low-income, and other medically underserved children are more likely to be diagnosed with late stage disease, experience poorer treatment outcomes, have shorter survival time with less quality of life, and experience a substantially greater likelihood of cancer death.
:(6) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as therapies evolve, which means that the monitoring and care of cancer survivors may need to be modified on a routine basis.
:(7) Despite the intense stress caused by childhood cancer, there is a lack of standardized and coordinated psychosocial care for the children and their families, from the date of diagnosis through treatment and survivorship.
:(8) The Institute of Medicine, in its report on cancer survivorship entitled Childhood Cancer Survivorship: Improving Care and Quality of Life , states that an organized system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer survivors is needed.
:(9) Focused and well-designed research and pilot health delivery programs can answer questions about the optimal ways to provide health care, follow-up monitoring services, and survivorship care to those diagnosed with childhood cancer and contribute to improvements in the quality of care and quality of life of those individuals.
