::(B) recommended that nationally significant sites associated with the Manhattan Project be formally established as a collective unit and be administered for preservation, commemoration, and public interpretation in cooperation with the [[w:National Park Service|National Park Service]] ;
:(3) the Manhattan Project National Historical Park Study Act([[Public Law -|[[Public Law 108-340|Public Law 108–340]] ]] ;118 Stat. 1362)directed the [[w:United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] , in consultation with the [[w:United States Department of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] , to conduct a special resource study of the historically significant sites associated with the Manhattan Project to assess the national significance, suitability, and feasibility of designating one or more sites as a unit of the [[w:National Park Service|National Park System]] ;
