To amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that major rules of the executive branch shall have no force or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted into law.

=Section 1. Short title=

=Sec. 2. Findings and purpose=



==(a) Findings– ==

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress.

:(3) By requiring a vote in [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] , the REINS Actwill result in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the people of the United States for the laws imposed upon them.

==(b) Purpose– ==

The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process.

=Sec. 3. Congressional review of agency rulemaking=

Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
