={{anchor|H07D1BFBEEC9A4A9DB61B5786A9419878}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the
			 “One Percent Spending Reduction Act of
			 2013”.

			 findings and purpose=



=={{anchor|H6AF97B4F40864420AC0D333EDB20BB74}}(a) Findings– ==

The
			 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) The fiscal crisis
			 faced by the Federal Government demands immediate action.
:(2) The dramatic
			 growth in spending and debt in recent years threatens our economic and national
			 security:
::(A) Federal spending
			 has grown from 18 percent of GDP in 2001 to nearly 23 percent of GDP in
			 2012.
::(B) Total Federal debt
			 exceeds $16,000,000,000,000 and is projected to increase each year over the
			 next 10 years.
::(C) Without action,
			 the Federal Government will continue to run massive deficits in the next decade
			 and total Federal debt will rise to $26,000,000,000,000 by 2023.
::(D) Interest payments
			 on this debt will soon rise to the point where balancing the budget as a matter
			 of policy is beyond the reach of Congress.
:(3) Due to recent tax
			 hikes, Federal revenues are scheduled to rise to approximately 19 percent of
			 GDP, a full percentage point above the average of about 18 percent of GDP over
			 the past 40 years.
:(4) Absent reform, the
			 growth of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health-related
			 spending will overwhelm all other Federal programs and consume all projected
			 tax revenues.

=={{anchor|HC68A163D2768478B9F698BD09D2127A1}}(b) Purpose– ==

The
			 purpose of this Act is to address the fiscal crisis by—
:(1) acting quickly to
			 balance the Federal budget and eliminate the parade of deficits and ballooning
			 interest payments;
:(2) achieving balance
			 by reducing spending one percent per year until spending equals projected
			 long-term revenues; and
:(3) reforming
			 entitlement programs to ensure long-term fiscal stability and balance.
