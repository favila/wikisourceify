=(a) Findings=

The [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress ]]finds the following:: The fiscal crisis faced by the Federal Government demands immediate action.: The dramatic growth in spending and debt in recent years threatens our economic and national security::: Federal spending has grown from 18 percent of GDP in 2001 to nearly 23 percent of GDP in 2012.:: Total Federal debt exceeds $16,000,000,000,000 and is projected to increase each year over the next 10 years.:: Without action, the Federal Government will continue to run massive deficits in the next decade and total Federal debt will rise to $26,000,000,000,000 by 2023.:: Interest payments on this debt will soon rise to the point where balancing the budget as a matter of policy is beyond the reach of Congress.: Due to recent tax hikes, Federal revenues are scheduled to rise to approximately 19 percent of GDP, a full percentage point above the average of about 18 percent of GDP over the past 40 years.: Absent reform, the growth of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health-related spending will overwhelm all other Federal programs and consume all projected tax revenues.
