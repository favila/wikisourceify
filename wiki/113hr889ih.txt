=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Global Free Internet Act of 2013” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) A single, open, global Internet is a vital tool for facilitating the free and secure flow of information and products without regard to distances or national boundaries.
:(2) The goal of a single, open, global Internet is best supported by policies that—
::(A) encourage utilization on a global basis of technology standards set by international standards-setting organizations, including industry-led and other voluntary bodies, and selected by the market;
::(B) respect the security of information, privacy, and speech of Internet users;
::(C) promote investment in Internet-related innovation;
::(D) refrain from compelling Internet service providers and other intermediaries to restrict the free flow of information on the Internet; and
::(E) allow trade in Internet-related goods, services, information, and content.
:(3) Certain governments and international bodies are adopting or considering policies contrary to the goal of a free, open Internet, including—
::(A) mandating unique technology standards favoring domestic producers as a condition of market access or pursuing related policies regarding standard-setting that are discriminatory and subvert the open, global nature of the Internet;
::(B) sponsoring or tolerating the use of Internet-related tools to gain unauthorized access to public-sector and private-sector networks in the United States to disrupt their operation;
::(C) blocking, filtering, or otherwise restricting Internet communications in a manner that discriminates against Internet-based services and content originating in other countries;
::(D) monitoring Internet use and communications in a manner that restricts individual privacy and freedom; and
::(E) imposing market access requirements or liabilities that discriminate against or otherwise impede Internet-related goods, services and content from other countries.
:(4) Such actions threaten the interests of the United States by—
::(A) facilitating attempts by foreign governments to restrict or disrupt the free flow of information on the Internet;
::(B) promoting “national Internets” in conflict with the underlying rationale and architecture of the Internet as originally envisioned and constructed, thereby compromising the Internet’s full functionality and promise;
::(C) harming United States workers and businesses, undermining a strong United States industrial base, and putting foreign competitors at an advantage; and
::(D) putting at risk the utility of the Internet as a tool of open communication, assembly, and commerce, and the individuals who seek to use it for such purposes.
