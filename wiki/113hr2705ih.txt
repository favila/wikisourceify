{{Center|A BILL}}

To develop a pilot program to remove non-native predator fishes from the Stanislaus River to protect the native anadromous fishery resources affected by the operation of the New Melones Unit of the East Side Division of the Central Valley Project, and for other purposes.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Stanislaus River Native Anadromous Fish Improvement Act” .

=Sec. 2. Pilot program to protect anadromous fish in the stanislaus river=



==(a) Establishment of non-Native predator fish removal program– ==

The [[w:United States Bureau of Reclamation|Commissioner]] and districts, in consultation with the [[w:National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Marine Fisheries Service]] , the [[w:U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] , and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall jointly develop and conduct a pilot non-native predator fish removal program to remove non-native striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, and other non-native predator fishes from the Stanislaus River. The pilot program shall—
:(1) be scientifically based;
:(2) include methods to quantify the number and size of predator fishes removed each year, the impact of such removal on the overall abundance of predator fishes, and the impact of such removal on the populations of juvenile anadromous fish found in the Stanislaus River by, among other things, evaluating the number of juvenile anadromous fish that migrate past the rotary screw trap located at Caswell;
:(3) use wire fyke trapping, portable resistance board weirs, and boat electrofishing, which are the most effective predator collection techniques that minimize affects to native anadromous fish;
:(4) be developed, including the application for all necessary scientific research and species enhancement permits under section 10(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1539 16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)] ), for the performance of the pilot program, not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act;
