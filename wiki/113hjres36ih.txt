Any budget plan for a fiscal year for the Government submitted by the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] to the [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] shall include a justification by each department or agency of the Government for any funding proposed for that department or agency in that plan. The justification shall include a justification each line item in the budget of that department or agency based upon its effect on carrying out its mission and its effect, if any, on the gross domestic product of the United States and an additional funding level below the requested number that would allow that department or agency to complete all of its critical mission functions.

=9. =

This article shall take effect beginning with the earlier of the tenth fiscal year beginning after its ratification or the first fiscal year beginning after any fiscal year in which the budget of the United States is not in deficit. .
