 To amend title V of the Social Security Act to provide grants to States to establish State maternal mortality review committees on pregnancy-related deaths occurring within such States; to develop definitions of severe maternal morbidity and data collection protocols; and to eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Maternal Health Accountability Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings; purposes=



==(a) Findings– ==

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) The aggregate pregnancy-related mortality ratio in the United States as measured by the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System was 14.5 for the 8-year period 1998 through 2005, higher than any other period in the previous 20 years. Although this increase may reflect changes in data collection methods by the States, this reported increase, along with no improvement in previous years remains a source of great concern for the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and registered nurses, health care providers, and patient advocates such as the Joint Commission, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Amnesty International.
:(2) The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]has found that maternal deaths should be investigated through State-based maternal death reviews and maternal quality collaboratives, as these entities are well-situated to identify deaths, review the factors associated with them, and take action with the findings in order to institute the systemic changes needed to decrease pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated mortality.
:(3) Women of color and low-income women face added risks in terms of death, complications, and access to quality health care. African-American women are three to four times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications than White women. In 2006 the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]reported that the maternal mortality ratio for non-Hispanic White women was 9.1 deaths per 100,000 births compared with 34.8 deaths per 100,000 births for non-Hispanic Black women. These rates and disparities have not improved in more than 20 years.
:(4) Healthy People 2010, a comprehensive, nationwide health promotion and disease prevention agenda launched by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], set a target goal of reducing maternal mortality in the United States to 4.3 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2010. In 2007, the national maternal mortality ratio was 12.7 deaths per 100,000 live births.
:(5) Severe complications that result in women nearly dying, known as a near miss or severe maternal morbidity has increased by 75 percent for delivery (based on data comparing 1998 through 1999) and 114 percent for postpartum hospitalizations (based on data comparing 2008 through 2009). Such data also estimates that severe morbidity affects 52,000 women a year and is expected to continue to increase. Moreover, there is no scientific consensus on uniform definitions of severe maternal morbidity and best practices for data collection, making it difficult to measure the full extent of severe morbidity and developing evidence-based interventions.

==(b) Purposes– ==

The purposes of this Act are the following:
:(1) To establish governmental accountability and a shared responsibility between States and the Federal Government to identify opportunities for improvement in quality of care and system changes, and to educate and inform health institutions and professionals, women, and families about preventing pregnancy-related deaths and complications and reducing disparities.
:(2) To develop a model for States to operate maternal mortality reviews and assess the various factors that may have contributed to maternal mortality, including quality of care, racial disparities, and systemic problems in the delivery of health care, and to develop appropriate interventions to reduce and prevent such deaths. 

=Sec. 3. Uniform State maternal mortality review committees on pregnancy-related deaths=
