To reduce by 5 percent the discretionary budget authority

={{anchor|H2F35791144D443F498D420558050F64A}}Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the
			 “Audit the Pentagon Act of
			 2013”.

={{anchor|HDB2D7EEDC1BE42EFA9A274F622410774}}Sec. 2. Purposes=

The purposes of this Act are as
			 follows:
:(1) To strengthen
			 American national security by ensuring that—
::(A) military planning, operations, weapons
			 development, and a long-term national security strategy are connected to sound
			 financial controls; and
::(B) defense dollars are spent
			 efficiently.
:(2) To instill a
			 culture of accountability at the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] that supports the vast
			 majority of dedicated members of the Armed Forces and civilians who want to
			 ensure proper accounting and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.

={{anchor|H13E513350AEE4EEAB15A5F1E625F70EF}}Sec. 3. Findings=

Congress finds the following:
:(1) The 2012 Financial Report of the United
			 States Government found that 21 of 24 major Federal agencies received clean
			 audit opinions. Two more, the [[Wikipedia:Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and the
			 [[Wikipedia:United States Department of State|Department of State]], received “qualified” audit opinions but are
			 making progress. Only the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] had a “disclaimer”
			 because it lacked any auditable reporting or accounting available for
			 independent review. In the Financial Report, the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]
			 summarized: “Over the past 20 years, an increasing number of Federal
			 agencies have initiated and sustained disciplined and consistent financial
			 reporting operations, implemented effective internal controls around financial
			 reporting, and have successfully integrated transaction processing and
			 accounting records. These efforts have resulted in improved results on
			 financial statement audits. However, weaknesses in basic financial management
			 practices and other limitations continue to prevent one major agency, and the
			 Government as a whole, from achieving an audit opinion.”.
:(2) The financial
			 management of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] has been on the
			 “High-Risk” list of the [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).
			 The [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|GAO]] found that the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department]] is not consistently able to “control
			 costs; ensure basic accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the
			 budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; and prevent and detect
			 fraud, waste, and abuse”.
:(3) At a September
			 2010 hearing of the Senate, the [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] stated that
			 past expenditures by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] of $5,800,000,000 to improve
			 financial information, and billions of dollars more of anticipated expenditures
			 on new information technology systems for that purpose, may not suffice to
			 achieve full audit readiness of the financial statement of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department]]. At
			 that hearing, the [[Wikipedia:Government Accountability Office|Government Accountability Office]] could not predict when the
			 [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department]] would achieve full audit readiness of such statements.
:(4) Section 9 of
			 article 1 of the Constitution of the United States requires all agencies of the
			 Federal Government, including the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to publish “a
			 regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public
			 money”.
:(5) Section 303(d) of
			 the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–576) required that
			 financial statements be prepared and independently audited for the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Army|Department
			 of the Army]] by March 31, 1992, and for the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] by March
			 31, 1993. Neither the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] nor the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air
			 Force]] has complied.
:(6) Section 3515 of
			 title 31, United States Code, requires the agencies of the Federal Government,
			 including the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to present auditable financial statements
			 beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department]] has not complied with
			 this law.
:(7) The Federal
			 Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 3512 note) requires
			 financial systems acquired by the Federal Government, including the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department
			 of Defense]], to be able to provide information to leaders to manage and control
			 the cost of government. The [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department]] has not complied with this law.
:(8) The National
			 Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107–107) requires
			 the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] to report to [[Wikipedia:United States Congress|Congress]] annually on the reliability of
			 the financial statements of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to minimize resources
			 spent on producing unreliable financial statements, and to use resources saved
			 to improve financial management policies, procedures, and internal
			 controls.
:(9) In 2005, the
			 [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] created a Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness
			 (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a directorate within the office of the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Under Secretary
			 of Defense]] (Comptroller), to improve [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department]] business processes with the
			 goal of producing timely, reliable, and accurate financial information that
			 could generate an audit-ready annual financial statement. In December 2005,
			 that directorate, known as the FIAR Directorate, issued the first of a series
			 of semiannual reports on the status of the Financial Improvement and Audit
			 Readiness Plan.
:(10) The National
			 Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111–84) requires
			 regular status reports on the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan
			 described in paragraph (9), and codified as a statutory requirement the goal of
			 the Plan in ensuring that [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] financial statements are
			 validated as ready for audit not later than September 30, 2017.

			 [[Wikipedia:Executive Office of the President|President]] may waive subsection (c)(2) with respect to an account if the

			 accounts or vital protection (such as body armor) for members of the Armed
			 Forces in harm’s way;
:(2) the valuation of
			 legacy assets by the [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] should be simplified without
			 compromising essential controls or generally accepted government auditing
			 standards; and
:(3) nothing in this
			 Act should be construed to require or permit the declassification of accounting
			 details about classified defense programs, and, as required by law, the
			 [[Wikipedia:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] should ensure financial accountability in such programs
			 using proven practices, including using auditors with security
			 clearances.
