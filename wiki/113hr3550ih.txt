===C Bankruptcy, not bailouts, for complex financial institutions– ===



===Sec. 221. Reforming the bankruptcy code to accommodate failing financial institutions===



====(a) Findings– ====

The [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Bailouts undermine market discipline and the rule of law, resulting in doubt about property rights and insulating recipients from the consequences of their mistakes.
:(2) A number of complex financial institutions are widely considered to be “too big to fail” .
:(3) An aggravating factor in the 2008 financial crisis was uncertainty about the security and priority of claims stemming from cross-border resolution of complex financial institutions.
:(4) The [[w:Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) has historically resolved most failing U.S. depository institutions and has the necessary expertise and discretionary authority to conduct such resolutions quickly.
:(5) The [[w:Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC’s]] authority did not extend to all components of very large, complex financial institutions, such as insurance, stockbroker, and commodity broker operations.
:(6) The U.S. Constitution authorizes [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] to establish “uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcies through the United States” .
:(7) Bankruptcy provides predictable priority for claims under the rule of law through the jurisdiction of an Article III court.
:(8) The lengthy adjudication of claims to ensure equality under the law of similarly situated creditors under bankruptcy can be problematic in the case of financial institutions but can be amended to preserve and protect value.
:(9) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Actdid not establish a non-discretionary, rule-of-law-based resolution process to provide certainty for creditors of failing institutions.
:(10) A credible resolution process could eliminate the use of bailouts and other political interventions.
:(11) Additional reforms are necessary to bring certainty and predictability to the failure of large, complex, multinational financial institutions.

====(b) Sense of Congress– ====

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] that the [[w:United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committees on the Judiciary]] and [[w:United States House Committee on Financial Services|Financial Services of the House of Representatives]] and the [[w:United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Committees on the Judiciary]] and [[w:United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate]] should each report legislation proposing changes to existing law within each committee’s jurisdiction with provisions to accommodate bankruptcy proceedings for failing multinational financial institutions. Such committees should consider reforms that—
:(1) establish a new chapter of the bankruptcy code specifically for financial institutions, to be used in conjunction with the existing chapter 7 liquidation or chapter 11 reorganization process;
:(2) replace or supplement existing resolution authorities for certain kinds of institutions;
:(3) clarify that such resolution proceedings occur at the holding company level;
:(4) designate particular judges in the Second and D.C. Circuits who will hear these cases and who may appoint special masters with technical expertise to aid in the resolution;
