<blockquote> 

===Sec. 424. Notification relating to certain bioengineered organisms===



====(a) In general– ====

A bioengineered organism shall not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for a food use or application unless—
:(1) the use or application of the bioengineered organism in food has been addressed by the developer of the bioengineered organism in a premarket biotechnology notification, to which the Secretary has responded under subsection (d)(2)(A) by stating no objections; or
:(2) 
::(A) food produced from, containing, or consisting of the bioengineered organism was evaluated by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]pursuant to the [[w:Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration’s]]voluntary consultation process for foods and food products from genetically engineered plants in effect prior to the date of enactment of the  Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2014  ; and
::(B) the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]informed the developer of the bioengineered organism that all questions about safety have been resolved.

====(b) Exceptions– ====

This section does not apply with respect to the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a bioengineered organism—
:(1) for the purpose of development or testing conducted to generate data and information that could be used in a premarket biotechnology notification or other regulatory submission; or
:(2) solely because—
::(A) a processing aid or enzyme produced from the bioengineered organism is intended to be used to produce food; or
::(B) food produced from, containing, or consisting of the bioengineered organism is intended to be fed to an animal from which food is intended to be produced or derived.

====(c) Premarket Biotechnology Notification– ====



=====(1) Submission– =====

At least 210 days before a bioengineered organism is first introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for a food use or application, a premarket biotechnology notification shall be submitted to the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]by the developer of the bioengineered organism. Such notification shall provide—
:(A) the basis for the notifier’s determination that food produced from, containing, or consisting of such bioengineered organism is as safe for use by humans or animals, as applicable, as one or more comparable marketed foods that are not produced from, do not contain, or do not consist of such bioengineered organism; and
:(B) whether any other Federal agency is conducting or has conducted any review of the bioengineered organism and the status or conclusions of any such review.

=====(2) Consultation prior to submission– =====

A prospective notifier may consult informally with the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]concerning a bioengineered organism intended for a food use or application before submitting a premarket biotechnology notification.

====(d) Response to a Premarket Biotechnology Notification– ====



=====(1) Preliminary response– =====

Within 30 days of receipt of a premarket biotechnology notification, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall—
:(A) inform the notifier in writing that the notification is complete and has been filed; or
:(B) inform the notifier in writing of any missing elements that prevent the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]from filing and reviewing the notification.The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]shall limit any request under subparagraph (B) to data or information necessary to perform the evaluation specified in paragraph (2) and shall not delay informing the notifier under paragraph (1)(A) for any other purpose.

=====(2) Substantive response– =====

Within 180 days of the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]informing the notifier under paragraph (1)(A) that the premarket biotechnology notification is complete, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]—
:(A) shall respond in writing to the notifier that the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]has evaluated the notification and has no objections to the notifier’s determination that food produced from, containing, or consisting of the bioengineered organism that is the subject of the notification is as safe for use by humans or animals, as applicable, as one or more comparable marketed foods that are not produced from, do not contain, or do not consist of such bioengineered organism; or
:(B) shall—
::(i) respond in writing to the notifier that the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]has evaluated the notification and has determined the notification does not provide an adequate basis for the notifier’s determination; and
::(ii) include in such response the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary's]]basis for the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary’s]]determination.

=====(3) Withdrawal by notifier– =====

=====(4) Effective date– =====

A notification submitted under subsection (c) shall become effective on the date that is 180 days after the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]informs the notifier under paragraph (1)(A) that the notification is complete, and as of such date the bioengineered organism that is the subject of the notification may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, unless the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]provides a response under paragraph (2)(B) .

====(e) Labeling– ====

If the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]determines that there is a material difference between a food produced from, containing, or consisting of a bioengineered organism and its comparable marketed food and that disclosure of such difference is necessary to protect health and safety or to prevent the label or labeling of such food from being false or misleading, the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]may, in a response under subsection (d)(2)(A) , specify labeling that would adequately inform consumers of such material difference. The use of bioengineering does not, by itself, constitute a material difference.

====(f) Public Disclosure– ====

The existence and contents of a premarket biotechnology notification shall be made available to the public as of the date the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]issues a written response under subsection (d)(2)(A) , subject to review by the [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Secretary]]pursuant to the provisions on exemptions from disclosure under chapter 5of title 5, United States Code.

:(1) 
::(A) The term comparable marketed food means, with respect to the food produced from, containing, or consisting of a plant that is a bioengineered organism—
:::(i) the parental variety of the plant;
:::(ii) another commonly consumed variety of the plant; or

::(A) significantly alters the characteristics, including the functional or compositional characteristics, of a food, such that the common or usual name no longer adequately describes the food;
::(B) results in a significantly different nutritional property in the food produced from, containing, or consisting of the bioengineered organism; or
::(C) results in the food containing an allergen that consumers would not expect to be present based upon the name of the food. .
