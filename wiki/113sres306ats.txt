{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Designating Thursday, November 21, 2013, as“Feed America Day”.    Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless giving and an appreciation for family and friends;   Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon which the United States was founded;   Whereas according to the [[w:United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], approximately 50,000,000 people in the United States, including 16,700,000 children, continue to live in households that do not have an adequate supply of food; and   Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of thanksgiving, both affirming and restoring fundamental principles in our society: Now, therefore, be it
