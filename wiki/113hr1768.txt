 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds the following:

:(2) United States Government personnel and missions abroad are confronted by serious security risks, including the threat of terrorism, which will continue for the foreseeable future.
:(3) The Accountability Review Board process was established in 1986 by Congress to conduct a thorough assessment of security-related incidents at or related to a United States Government mission abroad.
:(4) Each assessment by a Board is expected to promote strengthened security measures, and to provide for the accountability of United States Government personnel with security-related responsibilities.
:(5) The terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, that took the lives of four United States Government personnel has brought unprecedented attention to the work of such Boards.
