And it definitely will be cut off.” ;Whereas, in August 2012, Supreme Leader Khamenei said of Israel, “This bogus and fake Zionist outgrowth will disappear off the landscape of geography.” ;Whereas, in August 2012, President Ahmadinejad said that “in the new Middle East … there will be no trace of the American presence and the Zionists” ;Whereas the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] has designated the Islamic Republic of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and has characterized the Islamic Republic of Iran as the “most active state sponsor of terrorism” in the world;Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hizballah, and Shiite militias in Iraq that are responsible for the murder of hundreds of United States service members and innocent civilians;Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has provided weapons, training, and funding to the regime of Bashar al Assad that has been used to suppress and murder its own people;Whereas, since at least the late 1980s, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and well-documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities to acquire a nuclear weapons capability;Whereas, since September 2005, the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has found the Islamic Republic of Iran to be in non-compliance with its safeguards agreement with the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] , which Iran is obligated to undertake as a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 (NPT);Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran its full and sustained suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and its full cooperation with the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] on all outstanding issues related to its nuclear activities, particularly those concerning the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program;Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has refused to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions or to fully cooperate with the IAEA;Whereas, in November 2011, the IAEA Director General issued a report that documented “serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme,” and affirmed that information available to the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] indicates that “Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device” and that some activities may be ongoing;Whereas the Government of Iran stands in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for denying its citizens basic freedoms, including the freedoms of expression, religion, peaceful assembly and movement, and for flagrantly abusing the rights of minorities and women;Whereas in his State of the Union Address on January 24, 2012, President

shitburger[[w:Barack Obama|Obama]] reiterated, “The leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations.

shitburger[[w:Barack Obama|Obama]] stated, “And whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the state of Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should not be a shred of doubt by now: when the chips are down, I have Israel’s back.” ;Whereas, on October 22, 2012, President

shitburger[[w:Barack Obama|Obama]]  “As you begin your second term as [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]] , we ask you to reiterate your readiness to take military action against Iran if it continues its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.
