{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Expressing support for designation of September 2013 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.    Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers;   Whereas ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States;   Whereas, in 2013, approximately 22,240 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed and 14,030 women will die of ovarian cancer in the United States;   Whereas these are deaths of our mothers, sisters, daughters, family members, and community leaders;   Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not significantly decreased since the War on Cancer was declared 40 years ago;   Whereas the relative 5-year survival rate is 44 percent, although survival rates vary depending on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis;   Whereas the lack of a reliable early detection test means that approximately 75 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected at an advanced stage;   Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a family history that puts them at a higher risk;   Whereas some women, such as those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, are at a higher risk for ovarian cancer;   Whereas the Pap test is sensitive and specific to the early detection of cervical cancer, but not ovarian cancer;   Whereas there is currently no reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer;   Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary symptoms, and several other symptoms that are easily confused with other diseases;   Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by women and health care providers can lead to a quicker diagnosis;   Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to provide consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier for women to learn and remember the symptoms;   Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk for ovarian cancer and that play an important role in the prevention of the disease, such as prophylactic surgery, the use of oral contraceptives, and breastfeeding;   Whereas each year during the month of September, the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance and its partner members hold a number of events to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer; and   Whereas September 2013 should be designated as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it
