=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Since June 12, 2014, the foreign terrorist organization Hamas and other Palestinian extremists have been launching dozens of rockets per day at the State of Israel.
:(2) Hamas possesses approximately 12,000 missiles of assorted ranges that could threaten approximately 40 percent of the Israeli population.
:(3) Iran has supplied Hamas and other Palestinian extremists with long-range missiles, capable of hitting Israeli population centers 100 miles away.
:(4) Hamas rockets are either unguided or have inaccurate guidance systems, making them true weapons of terror designed only to kill people at random.
:(5) Hamas has admitted targeting Israel’s nuclear research reactor at Dimona.
:(6) The use of rockets by Hamas against Israeli population centers has been called a war crime.
:(7) In March 2014, Israel intercepted the ship Klos-C, which was carrying dozens of long-range rockets, reportedly from Iran to Hamas.
:(8) The United States remains committed to Israel’s qualitative military edge, including its advantage over Hamas and other foreign terrorist organizations.
:(9) The Israeli Defense Forces report that the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system has achieved a success rate of 90 percent, intercepting rockets bound for civilian population centers, including residential neighborhoods, busy road junctions, shopping centers, and crowded streets.
:(10) The recent success of the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system averted massive Israeli casualties.
:(11) Supporting Israel’s ability to defend itself against missiles, rockets, and other threats advances the United States own vital national security interests and the cause of Middle Eastern peace and stability.
:(12) The White House said on July 8, 2014,“No country can accept rocket fire aimed at civilians and we support Israel’s right to defend itself against these vicious attacks.”.
:(13) In 2012,
[[w:Barack Obama|President Obama]]called Iron Dome“critical in terms of providing security and safety for Israeli families. It is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile strikes inside of Israel.”.
