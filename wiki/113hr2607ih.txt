{{Center|A BILL}}

To establish programs with respect to childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer.

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the “Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Reauthorization Act” .

=Sec. 2. Findings=

 [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] finds as follows:
:(1) Every year, 13,500 children in the United States are diagnosed with cancer.
:(2) While the cure rates for some childhood cancers are now over 80 percent, the survival rates for many types of cancers in children remain extremely low.
:(3) According to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] , cancer continues to be the leading cause of death by disease in children and adolescents under the age of 14.
:(4) There are currently more than 360,000 childhood cancer survivors living in the United States.
:(5) As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors experience at least one long-term health effect of their cancer treatment, including secondary malignancies, cardiopulmonary damage, physical and intellectual developmental impairments, endocrine disorders, and others.
:(6) Collection of biospecimens and clinical and demographic data on the maximum possible number of children with cancer in the United States is necessary to improve childhood cancer treatments and cures. Currently biospecimens and some demographic data are collected for less than half of children with cancer.
