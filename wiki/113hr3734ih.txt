[[w:Tony Cardenas|Mr. Cárdenas]](for himself and
[[w:Mike Honda|Mr. Honda]]) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the [[w:United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]] }}

  
{{Center|A BILL}}

 To establish a task force to share best practices on computer programming and coding for elementary schools and secondary schools, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“416d65726963612043616e20436f6465 Act of 2013”or the“ America Can Code Act of 2013 ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) According to the [[w:National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation]], 2 percent of students studying science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) are computer science majors, while 60 percent of STEM jobs are in the computing field.
:(2) The [[w:Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor Statistics]]estimates that computer programming jobs are growing at twice the national job growth average, and these jobs are high paying middle class jobs that can secure the financial future of many American families and also help grow the United States economy. 

=Sec. 3. Sense of Congress=

It is the sense of [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]that—
:(1) secondary schools should focus on preparing career and technical students, including underrepresented groups such as minorities and women, for academic and technical opportunities in postsecondary education or entry into a high paying, skilled job in the computer programming field;
:(2) elementary schools and secondary schools should place emphasis on coding and computer programming as a vocational and technical education track;
:(3) educators should rethink the way coding as a skill is conceptualized within the education system and in our society; and
:(4) learning to write and read code is critical to creating and innovating in cyberspace, and learning this language is also a skill critical to the national security and economic competitiveness of the United States. 

=Sec. 4. Coding as a critical foreign language=

   Section 6002(b)(1) of the America COMPETES Act ( [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/9802 20 U.S.C. 9802(b)(1)] )is amended by inserting“, including a computer programming language,”after“a foreign language”. 

=Sec. 5. Amendments to the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006=
