 Honoring the entrepreneurial spirit of small business concerns in the United States during National Small Business Week, which begins on June 17, 2013.    Whereas this year marks the 50th anniversary of National Small Business Week;   Whereas the approximately 27,900,000 small business concerns in the United States are the driving force behind the Nation’s economy, creating nearly 2 out of every 3 new jobs and generating close to 50 percent of the Nation’s nonfarm gross domestic product;   Whereas small businesses are the driving force behind the economic recovery of the United States;   Whereas small businesses represent 99.7 percent of employer firms in the United States;   Whereas small business concerns are the Nation’s innovators, serving to advance technology and productivity;   Whereas small business concerns represent 98 percent of all exporters and produce 31 percent of exported goods;   Whereas [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]established the [[w:Small Business Administration|Small Business Administration]]in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve free and competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair proportion of the total Federal Government purchases, contracts, and subcontracts for property and services are placed with small business concerns, to ensure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property are made to such small business concerns, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the United States;   Whereas every year since 1963, the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]has designated a“National Small Business Week”to recognize the contributions of small businesses to the economic well-being of the United States;   Whereas in 2013, National Small Business Week will honor the estimated 27,900,000 small businesses in the United States;   Whereas the [[w:Small Business Administration|Small Business Administration]]has helped small business concerns by providing access to critical lending opportunities, protecting small business concerns from excessive Federal regulatory enforcement, helping to ensure full and open competition for Government contracts, and improving the economic environment in which small business concerns compete;   Whereas for more than 50 years, the [[w:Small Business Administration|Small Business Administration]]has helped millions of entrepreneurs achieve the American dream of owning a small business, and has played a key role in fostering economic growth; and   Whereas the [[w:Executive Office of the President|President]]has designated the week beginning June 17, 2013, as“National Small Business Week”: Now, therefore, be it
