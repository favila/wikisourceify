{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Supporting the goals and objectives of Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union.    Whereas Ireland holds the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2013;   Whereas the rotating European Union Presidency offers member states the opportunity to showcase their vision for the European Union, to advance the Union's ongoing work agenda, influence European Union policy and legislation, and broaden the understanding of the European Union amongst the citizens of their country;   Whereas the European Union has established an area of freedom, security, and justice, extending stability and peace to the European continent and its neighbors;   Whereas the United States has supported the European integration process and has consistently supported the objective of European unity and the enlargement of the European Union as a vehicle for prosperity, peace, and democracy;   Whereas the Government of Ireland has prioritized stability, jobs, and growth as the main areas of focus for Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union;   Whereas the United States and the European Union are each other's largest trading and investment partners, responsible for creating up to an estimated 14,000,000 jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and as such major stakeholders in each other’s economic recoveries;   Whereas the United States and Ireland participate in long-standing research and science-based exchanges that promote renewable and marine technologies worldwide;   Whereas Irish culture and Irish-Americans have contributed greatly to United States society, history, and politics; and   Whereas approximately one in four United States citizens trace some part of their ancestry to Ireland: Now, therefore, be it     That the [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]— 
:(1) supports the goals and objectives of Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union; 
:(2) encourages the launch of United States–European Union trade and investment negotiations that will benefit both United States and European workers alike; 
:(3) promotes increased transatlantic exchanges and dialogue to further benefit from existing cultural ties and research and development partnerships, particularly in the maritime area where a transatlantic research alliance could underpin the development of the strong growth and jobs potential of our shared ocean resources, a so-called blue growth strategy; 
:(4) affirms the deep roots of common heritage between the United States and Ireland; and 
:(5) acknowledges the lasting contributions of Irish-Americans to the United States.
