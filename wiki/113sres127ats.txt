{{Center|RESOLUTION}}

 Commemorating the 10-year anniversary of the loss of the State symbol of New Hampshire, the Old Man of the Mountain.    Whereas retreating glaciers carved the White Mountains, leaving behind the Old Man of the Mountain (referred to in this preamble as the Old Man ) as a sentinel to gaze across their granite majesty;   Whereas granite ledges formed the profile of the Old Man, framed by the sweeping curve of the shoulder of a mountain;   Whereas the native son of New Hampshire and distinguished Member of the Senate, Daniel Webster, wrote: “Men hang out their signs indicative of their respective trades; shoe makers hang out a gigantic shoe; jewelers a monster watch, and the dentist hangs out a gold tooth; but up in the Mountains of New Hampshire, God Almighty has hung out a sign to show that there He makes men”;   Whereas both the proud visage and the steadfastness of the Old Man embodied the character traits of independence, strength, and a dedication to live free that are embedded in Granite Staters;   Whereas the home of the Old Man, New Hampshire, possesses a clear sense of its place in the history of the United States as— 
:(1) the first State to adopt its own constitution; 
:(2) the State whose ratification of the Constitution of the United States helped bring forth this country; and 
:(3) the State that, as host of the first presidential primary in the United States, has a continuing role in each election of the [[w:President of the United States|President]] ;   Whereas the Old Man was visited by sightseers from around the world, who found strength and inspiration in his image;   Whereas visits to the Old Man have inspired reverence for that which is irreplaceable;   Whereas, for 10 millennia, the Old Man survived legendary winds, snow, rain, and ice;   Whereas, on May 3, 2003, the time-worn granite ledges of the visage of the Old Man released their hold on the mountain and fell into history;   Whereas the loss of the Old Man forever changed the face of New Hampshire and was felt by all people of the State accustomed to living under his watchful gaze;   Whereas the Old Man, who lived in the heart of the White Mountains, now lives on in the hearts of the people of New Hampshire; and   Whereas, while Granite Staters mourn the loss of their granite man, they pay tribute with a long glance up at the bare face of the grey mountain and a pause in remembrance of the first citizen of the beloved State: Now, therefore, be it    

= =

That the [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] —
:(1) recognizes the 10th anniversary of the loss of the Old Man of the Mountain;
:(2) encourages the people of the United States to preserve the legacy of the Old Man of the Mountain;
:(3) recognizes the inspiration provided by the Old Man of the Mountain to generations of Granite Staters and visitors to the State of New Hampshire; and
:(4) recognizes the Old Man of the Mountain as a symbol of liberty, freedom, and independence.
