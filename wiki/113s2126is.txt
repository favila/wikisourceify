 To launch a national strategy to support regenerative medicine through the establishment of a Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council, and for other purposes.   

=Section 1. Short title=

This Act may be cited as the“   Regenerative Medicine Promotion Act of 2014   ”. 

=Sec. 2. Findings=

  [[w:United States Congress|Congress]]finds the following:
:(1) Regenerative medicine has the potential to treat many chronic diseases, promote economic growth, and reduce health care spending in the United States.
:(2) Regenerative medicine products have already successfully treated numerous health conditions and have the potential to provide cures, treatments and diagnostics for a range of diseases and disabilities including diabetes, spinal cord injury, heart disease, stroke, various forms of cancer, and other age-related conditions that represent a huge quality of life, social, and economic burden on society.
:(3) A United States national strategy on regenerative medicine is critical to ensure that this technology fulfills its potential to cure and treat diseases and disabilities, reduce overall health care spending, and promote economic growth.
:(4) The [[w:United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]has stated that regenerative medicine has the potential to treat many battlefield injuries such as burns, that it has the potential to heal wounds without scarring, and that it has the potential to be used for craniofacial reconstruction, limb reconstruction, regeneration, and transplantation.
:(5) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]and the Multi-Agency Tissue Engineering Science Interagency Working Group have endorsed a national initiative to support research and product development in regenerative medicine.
:(6) The [[w:Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]has said the potential benefits of regenerative medicine in improved health care and economic savings are enormous. States that have invested in regenerative medicine have experienced economic growth and see future growth potential, including an increase in biotech employment, payroll increases, and proportional impacts on tax receipts. 

=Sec. 3. Report on ongoing Federal programs and activities regarding regenerative medicine=

Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the [[w:Government Accountability Office|Comptroller General of the United States]]shall provide for the completion, and submission to [[w:United States Congress|Congress]], of a report identifying all ongoing Federal programs and activities regarding regenerative medicine.
