        <paragraph id="idd0b170dc76174eec92ca30f4e4dbb874">
          <enum>(1)</enum>
          <text>The United States classrooms are increasingly filled with less experienced teachers, as elderly
			 teachers retire and the retention rate among young teachers continues to
			 decrease. The most common number of years of teaching experience for
			 public school teachers has decreased from 15 years experience in 1987–1988
			 to 5 years in 2011–2012. According to the most recent data, 1,700,000
			 teachers, representing 45 percent of the workforce, had less than 10 years
			 of experience. Students deserve teachers with more experience and
			 training.</text>

          <enum>(2)</enum>
          <text>Recent research confirms that additional years of teaching experience at the same grade level (up
			 to 20 years) add a direct positive impact on student achievement.</text>

          <text>The most recent data (2011–2012) from the <cato:entity-ref xmlns:cato="http://namespaces.cato.org/catoxml" entity-id="9138" entity-type="federal-body">National Center for Education Statistics</cato:entity-ref> find 32.8
			 percent of public schools in the United States are in rural areas. The
			 associated costs rural schools face mean that they often have less money
			 for instructional costs and salaries. <cato:entity-ref xmlns:cato="http://namespaces.cato.org/catoxml" entity-id="9100" entity-type="federal-body">Department of Education</cato:entity-ref> data show
			 that rural school districts have the lowest base salaries for starting
			 teachers, a trend that continues even as teachers move to the top of the
			 local salary range. Rural schools face these challenges across the
			 country.</text>

          <enum>(4)</enum>
          <text>The most recent study by the Education Trust found that high schools with high poverty rates are
			 twice as likely to have teachers that are not certified in their fields
			 than high schools with low poverty rates. The same study found that high
			 poverty schools have a higher percentage of first year teachers. Rural
			 schools face similar problems.</text>

          <text>The NRC found in 2008 that the average retention rate for National Board certified teachers is
			 higher than the rate for teachers who have not achieved certification.

			 the NRC found that nearly <fraction>3/4</fraction> of National Board certified teachers remained in the profession at the end of the study, compared
