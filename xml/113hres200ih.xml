    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the success of this vibrant, inclusive democracy

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea have
			 forged an economic partnership based on the principle of joint prosperity,

			 and services exports to the Republic of Korea, which all support jobs in the
			 United States;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas October 1, 2013, will mark the 60th anniversary of

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas North Korea has continued to threaten and strike

			 50 South Koreans;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States remains committed to honoring
