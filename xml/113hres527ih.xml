		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the week of April 7, 2014, through April 13, 2014, is National Public Health Week, and the
			 theme for 2014 is <quote>Public Health: Start Here</quote>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas since 1995, public health organizations have used National Public Health Week to educate
			 the public, policymakers, and public health professionals about issues
			 that are important to improving the health of the people of the United
			 States;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the public health system that keeps our communities healthy and safe is changing as
			 technologies advance, public attitudes toward health shift, and more
			 health and safety options become available;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in the air we breathe, the water we drink,
			 the food we eat, and the places where we all live, learn, work, and play;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas public health professionals help communities prepare for, withstand, and recover from the
			 impact of a natural or man-made disaster;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas according to the Institute of Medicine, despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the
			 world, the United States still ranks below many other economically
			 prosperous countries in life expectancy, infant mortality, and low birth
			 weight and many other indicators of healthy life;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas studies have shown that small strategic investments in prevention could result in
			 significant savings in health care costs;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas each 10-percent increase in local public health spending contributes to a 6.9-percent
			 decrease in infant deaths, a 3.2-percent decrease in cardiovascular
			 deaths, a 1.4-percent decrease in deaths due to diabetes, and a
			 1.1-percent decrease in cancer deaths;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in communities across the country, more people are changing the way they care for their
			 health by avoiding tobacco use, eating healthier, becoming more physically
			 active, and preventing unintentional injuries at home and in the
			 workplace; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas by adequately supporting public health and prevention, we can continue to transform a
			 health system focused on treating illness to focus on preventing disease
			 and promoting wellness: Now, therefore, be it</text>
    </whereas>
