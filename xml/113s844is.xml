        <text>The community
			 school model effectively leverages multiple education funding streams, which
			 results in greater resources for a school. Community schools increase and
			 sustain capacity through diversified financial support and leverage, on
			 average, 3 dollars from private and other sources for every 1 dollar of State
			 funding provided to the schools. According to Secretary of Education Arne
			 Duncan, for every dollar spent on community schools, the United States is
			 getting back 5, 6, or 7 dollars from the business community, nonprofit
			 organizations, social service agencies, and State and Federal
			 governments.</text>

        <text>According to
			 Linda Darling-Hammond, the Charles DuCommon Professor of Education at Stanford
			 University, community schools, which make local schools the hub of education
			 and health services for children and families, have proven to be highly
			 successful and are cost effective and replicable. Community schools are a force
			 for development and stability that strengthens families and communities, and
			 such schools offer childcare and early learning, family literacy and
			 job-training, tutoring and enrichment before and after school, and on-site
			 health clinics.</text>

        <text>The bulk of
			 community school resources go directly to assist schools in meeting the
			 schools' core instructional missions, while also strengthening the health and
			 well-being of students, families, and neighborhoods. Community schools dedicate
			 approximately 57 percent of expenditures to support learning through academic
			 enrichment and after school activities, summer learning programs, early
			 childhood education, service learning and civic engagement, life skills,
			 sports, and recreation. The second largest expenditure, 19 percent, is directed
			 towards health and mental health services, which ensure that children are
			 physically able to learn and that health-related barriers are identified and
			 addressed. On average, 12 percent of the resources are spent on supporting
			 families, adult education, and immigrant services. Twelve percent is spent on
			 staff sites, including the costs of a coordinator, tutors, interns, mentors,
			 and volunteers, working on the alignment of activities for the community
			 school.</text>

        <text>The Tulsa Area
			 Community Schools Initiative (TACSI) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, operates 18 community
			 schools that serve as centers of community life, offering comprehensive
			 programs, services, and opportunities to students, families, and the
			 neighboring community. Researchers compared 18 TACSI schools to 18 non-TACSI
			 schools and found that students in TACSI schools that had deeply embedded the
			 community school model scored significantly higher than comparable students in
			 non-TACSI schools on mathematics achievement tests. Further, the 18 TACSI
			 schools had higher ratings of instructional leadership and effective
			 supervisory practices, a stronger culture of faculty trust, and higher levels
			 of student trust of teachers, school identification among students, parent
			 trust in school, and school outreach, than the comparison schools.</text>

			 nonprofit organizations. Data shows that students who regularly participated in
			 SUN activities showed strong gains in academics, attendance, and behavioral

			 mathematics for such students, the average daily school attendance at such
			 schools was 95 percent, and 74 percent of the students had a more positive
