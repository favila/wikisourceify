		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas August 7, 2013, marks the 224th anniversary of the
			 signing by President George Washington of the <cato:entity entity-type="law-citation">Act entitled <quote>
            <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Lighthouse Act of 1789" official-title="true">An Act for
			 the establishment and support of lighthouses, beacons, buoys, and public
			 piers</cato:entity-ref>
          </quote>, approved August 7, 1789 (commonly known as the <quote>

			 Act of 1789</cato:entity-ref>

		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas that Act, the ninth act of the 1st Congress,
			 established a Federal role in the support, maintenance, and repair of all
			 lighthouses, beacon buoys, and public piers necessary for safe navigation,
			 commissioned the first Federal lighthouse, and represents the first public
			 works act in the young United States;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the establishment of the United States system of
			 navigational aids set the United States on a path to the forefront of
			 international maritime prominence and established lighthouses that played an
			 integral role in the rich maritime history of the United States, as that
			 history spread from the Atlantic coast, through the Great Lakes and the Gulf
			 coast, to the Pacific States;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas those iconic structures, standing at land's end
			 through 2 centuries, have symbolized safety, security, heroism, duty, and
			 faithfulness;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas architects, designers, engineers, builders, and
			 keepers devoted, and in some cases jeopardized, their lives for the safety of
			 others during centuries of light tending by the United States Lighthouse
			 Service and the United States Coast Guard;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the automation of the light system exposed the
			 historic lighthouse towers to the ravages of time and vandalism and yet, at the
			 same time, opened an opportunity for citizen involvement in efforts to save and
			 restore those beacons that mark the evolving maritime history of the United
			 States and its coastal communities;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the national lighthouse preservation movement has
			 gained momentum over the past half century and is making major contributions to
			 the preservation of maritime history and heritage and, through the development
			 and enhancement of cultural tourism, to the economies of coastal communities in
			 the United States;</text>
		</whereas>

		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, for the past several decades, regional and

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the earliest and largest regional preservation

			 national group, the United States Lighthouse Society, which relocated from San
			 Francisco, California, to the State of Washington in 2008, marks its 30th
