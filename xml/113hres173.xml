		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas on March 1, 2013, sequestration took effect,
			 thereby reducing the money available to Federal agencies;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0050">House of Representatives</cato:entity-ref> passed 2 bills that
			 would have made commonsense reforms to reductions in <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="9700">Department of Defense</cato:entity-ref>
			 programs and certain domestic programs;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government spent $3.538 trillion in the fiscal
			 year that ended in September 2012, and the $85 billion sequester is 2.4 percent
			 of the Federal budget;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1100">President</cato:entity-ref> is implementing several tactics in
			 his discussion of the potential effects of sequestration that needlessly alarm
			 the American people, but there is some flexibility and discretion on how to
			 implement the cuts, and the President must focus on more sensible reductions
			 that can be made within departments and agencies;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas given the rising national debt and deficit, the
			 Federal Government must reduce funding to programs, projects, and activities
			 that are wasteful;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the April 2013 <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0500">Government Accountability Office</cato:entity-ref>
			 report to <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref> entitled, <term>Actions Needed to Reduce Fragmentation,
			 Overlap, and Duplication and Achieve Other Financial Benefits</term> (and
			 designated as GAO–13–279SP), presents 31 areas in which Government programs
			 would be able to achieve greater efficiencies or become more effective in
			 providing Government services; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is the responsibility of the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1100">President</cato:entity-ref> and the
			 <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1103">Director of the Office of Management and Budget</cato:entity-ref> to coordinate with the heads of
			 the relevant departments and agencies to eliminate, consolidate, or streamline
			 Government programs and agencies with duplicative and overlapping missions to
			 save taxpayer dollars, rein in Washington spending, and curb the unnecessary
			 consequences of sequestration: Now, therefore, be it</text>
