    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas school social workers serve as critical members of a school’s educational team, playing a
			 central role in creating a positive school climate and vital partnerships
			 between the home, school, and community to ensure student academic
			 success;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas school social workers are especially skilled in providing services to students who face
			 serious challenges to school success, including poverty, disability,
			 discrimination, abuse, addiction, bullying, divorce of parents, loss of a
			 loved one, and other barriers to learning;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas school social workers coordinate the implementation of the school and community programs
			 that promote positive discipline and regularly assist and train school
			 personnel in promoting positive behaviors and preventing negative
			 behaviors that escalate into disproportionate disciplinary outcomes and
			 responses;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is a growing need for local educational agencies to offer the mental health services
			 that school social workers provide when working with families, teachers,
			 principals, community agencies, and other entities to address students’
			 emotional, physical, and environmental needs so that students may achieve
			 behavioral and academic success;</text>
		</whereas>

		</whereas>
    <whereas>

			 improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, decreasing discipline
			 referrals, and improving academic achievement;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early identification of mental health
			 problems and in the provision of appropriate services when needed; and</text>
