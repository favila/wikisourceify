			 taken wing in other Arab nations such as Tunisia, Libya, and Syria;</text>
      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas, reminiscent of the 1968<quote>Prague

			 and government repression;</text>
      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas, in the midst of newly acquired freedoms,
			 including those of speech, press, and assembly, it is extremely important that

			 thought;</text>
      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human

			 observance</quote>;</text>
      </whereas>

			 months;</text>
      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas, on November 1, 2010, the deadliest ever recorded

			 parishioners;</text>
      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas, on January 1, 2011, a suicide bomber blew himself
			 up in front of the Saint George and Bishop Peter Church in Cairo, killing 21

			 percent of Egypt's population of 80,000,000;</text>
      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas the freedom to proselytize by minority religious
			 communities in Arab nations has also come under repeated and deadly attack in

        <text>Whereas, on February 21, 2013, Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s
			 Ambassador to the United States, and a vocal proponent of repealing Pakistan’s
			 blasphemy law, was herself accused of blasphemy, and the Supreme Court of
