        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that PACE programs which incorporate prudent programmatic
			 safeguards to protect the interest of mortgage holders and property owners
			 remain viable as a potential avenue for States and local governments to
			 achieve the many public benefits associated with energy efficiency, water
			 efficiency, and renewable energy retrofits. In addition, it is essential
			 that the power and authority of State and local governments to exercise
			 their longstanding and traditional powers to levy taxes for public
			 purposes not be impeded.</text>
