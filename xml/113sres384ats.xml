	<preamble>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2139, adopted on February 22, 2014, expresses
			 grave alarm at the significant and rapid deterioration of the
			 humanitarian situation in Syria, in particular the dire situation of
			 hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in besieged areas, most of whom
			 are besieged by the Syrian armed forces and some by opposition groups, as
			 well as the dire situation of over 3,000,000 people in hard-to-reach
			 areas, and deplores the difficulties in providing, and the failure to
			 provide, access for the humanitarian assistance to all civilians in need
			 inside Syria;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas widespread and systematic attacks on civilians, schools, hospitals, and other civilian
			 infrastructure, in violation of international humanitarian law, continue
			 in Syria,
			 and parties to the conflict are blocking humanitarian aid delivery,
			 including food and medical care from many civilian areas;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="19UH" entity-type="federal-body">World Health Organization</cato:entity-ref> estimates that 70 percent of Syria’s health professionals, up
			 to 80,000 people, have fled the country, cases of typhoid, tuberculosis,
			 polio and other diseases are rampant and increasing, and medical
			 personnel inside Syria are deliberately targeted by parties to the
			 conflict;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" value="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees" entity-parent-id="19UN">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</cato:entity-ref> (UNHCR) has registered more than
			 2,500,000 Syrian refugees, nearly 80 percent of whom are women and
			 children, and by the end of this year, the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="19UN" entity-type="federal-body">United Nations</cato:entity-ref> estimates the
			 number of refugees will increase to 4,000,000;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas nearly 500,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict are children under the age of
			 five, and more than 11,000 children have been killed and thousands more
			 have suffered severe injuries, including burns, shrapnel wounds, the
			 severing
			 of limbs, and spinal cord injuries;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas over 5,000,000 children affected by the conflict desperately need food, clean water,
			 shelter, medical care and psychosocial support;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, since 2011, nearly 3,000,000 Syrian children have been forced to quit their education as
			 fighting has destroyed classrooms, left children too terrified to go to
			 school, and forced families to flee the country;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the refugee crisis threatens the stability of the Middle East, putting immense burdens on
			 Syria's neighbors, most notably Lebanon and Jordan,  as well as Turkey and
			 Iraq; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States Government has played a leading role in addressing the Syrian crisis,
			 providing
			 $1,700,000,000 in humanitarian assistance to those suffering inside Syria,
			 as well as to refugees and host communities in the neighboring countries:
			 Now, therefore, be it</text>
