          <enum>(1)</enum>
          <text>The Protection of
			 Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (in this subsection referred to as the
			 <term>PLCAA</term>) was enacted with the express purpose of prohibiting
			 <quote>causes of action against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and
			 importers of firearms or ammunition products, and their trade associations, for
			 the harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products
			 or ammunition products by others when the product functioned as designed and
			 intended.</quote>.</text>

          <enum>(2)</enum>
          <text>The intent of the
			 PLCAA was to bar a narrow category of lawsuits holding gun industry entities
			 liable for damages solely on the basis of selling a product that was used in
			 crime.</text>
				</paragraph>
        <paragraph id="H24A7827F52CB4EC4B733A31105C614D4">
          <enum>(3)</enum>
          <text>The chief sponsor
			 of PLCAA stated during floor debate, <quote>This legislation will not bar the
			 courthouse doors to victims who have been harmed by the negligence or misdeeds
			 of anyone in the gun industry. â€¦ If manufacturers or dealers break the law or
			 commit negligence, they are still liable.</quote>.</text>

        <paragraph id="H225CD67FA12B470B9BC3D20A6FBD5DCC">
          <enum>(4)</enum>
          <text>It was not the
			 intent of the Congress in the PLCAA to protect gun or ammunition manufacturers
			 or sellers who failed to exercise reasonable care for health and safety in the
			 design, marketing, and sale of their products.</text>

        <paragraph id="HF51797F3F8A4484998BA69F34427967B">
          <enum>(5)</enum>
          <text>Federal and State
			 courts have read the PLCAA contrary to its intent, and dismissed civil lawsuits
			 based on negligence, product defect, and other causes of action that are well
			 established in statute and common law principles.</text>

          <enum>(6)</enum>
          <text>This special
			 protection from civil liability enjoyed by the firearm industry is not only
			 contrary to the congressional intent of the PLCAA, but also contrary to public
			 safety, and unique among industries in the United States.</text>

        <paragraph id="HB3D46D01DEA347E2A5B182551E324C80">
          <enum>(7)</enum>
          <text>As Congress
			 intended in the PLCAA, the firearm industry should not be held liable solely
			 because a product they made or sold was used in crime, if those companies did
			 not engage in negligent or otherwise tortious conduct. However, as Congress
			 also intended in the PLCAA, State or Federal courts should not be barred from
			 applying State common or statutory law to impose liability on industry
			 participants who, through their negligent conduct or defective product, cause
			 an injury in which unlawful activity was also a cause.</text>

          <enum>(8)</enum>
          <text>As most firearms
			 dealers are responsible businesspeople who do not engage in negligent sales
			 practices, 86 percent of firearms dealers sell no guns that are subsequently
			 used in crimes, and 1.2 percent of firearms dealers sell 57 percent of crime
			 guns, the overwhelming majority of dealers need no special protection from
			 liability for damages resulting from the criminal use of guns.</text>

          <enum>(9)</enum>
          <text>Allowing victims
			 of gun violence to pursue civil actions in State and Federal courts against the
			 firearm industry on the basis of negligent behavior serves the interests of
			 justice and fosters the adoption of responsible business practices likely to
			 reduce the incidence of firearm deaths.</text>
