			 Department of Health and Human Services</cato:entity-ref>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas older women and women with disabilities rely on

			 care;</text>

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care
			 is critical to improving the health and well-being of women;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>

		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas 50 percent of uninsured women do not have a
			 regular doctor compared to 11 percent of insured women;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in
			 women’s health, particularly in maternal mortality, infant mortality, and
			 incidence of premature or low birth weight births;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
			 women have unique health care needs and confront a unique set of disparities in
			 the current health care system;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas pregnant women are often excluded from research
			 studies violating the ethical principle of justice;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas federally funded research is a critical component
			 to understanding health conditions in women across the life span, and has led
			 to many scientific breakthroughs that have been become clinical standards of
			 care;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas about half of pregnancies are unintended, though
			 preventing unintended pregnancies benefits child health, maternal health, and
			 the health and well-being of families and society as a whole;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there are continued efforts to defund or eliminate
			 family planning programs, even though they are proven to reduce unintended
			 pregnancies and reduce the need for abortions;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Medicaid program covers 71 percent of publicly
			 funded family planning services and over 40 percent of all United States births
			 and the Title X Family Planning program serves over 5,000,000 low-income men
			 and women a year who often do not have insurance or qualify for
			 Medicaid;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there have been numerous attempts, both legal and
			 legislative, to allow insurance companies and employers with personal religious
			 or moral objections to deny women the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act">Affordable Care Act</cato:entity-ref> preventive services
			 benefit requiring coverage for all FDA approved contraceptive methods, despite
			 the fact that such services are based on a foundation of scientific, medical
			 evidence supporting the effectiveness of preventive services;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas over-the-counter emergency contraception is not
			 available to all women, even though the American College of Obstetricians and
			 Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend increased access
			 to emergency contraception, without an age restriction, as a back-up birth
			 control option, as research shows it prevents unintended pregnancies and
			 reduces the need for abortion;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a lack of adequate prenatal care increases the
			 risks of having low birth-weight or preterm babies, neonatal mortality, infant
			 mortality, and maternal mortality;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas preterm births alone costs the United States
			 health care system $26,000,000,000 annually;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas many women lack access to comprehensive,
			 affordable insurance coverage, even though all women should have this for all
			 pregnancy-related care, including prenatal care, miscarriage management, family
			 planning services, abortion, labor and delivery services, and postnatal
			 care;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in 2012, State legislatures passed 43 laws in 19
			 States to restrict access to abortion, the second-highest number of such
			 measures passed in a single year;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas efforts have been made to ban Graduate Medical
			 Education funding from going towards abortion training, even though the
			 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) standards
			 stipulate that programs in obstetrics and gynecology must have an established
			 curriculum for family planning and managing complications of abortions, and
			 must provide the opportunity for direct procedural training in abortions for
			 those residents who desire it;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas legislators have attempted to inappropriately
			 interfere with the patient-physician relationship, often to satisfy political
			 agendas without regard to established, evidence-based guidelines for
			 care;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas this type of interference can inhibit open and
			 honest communication between patients and providers and also jeopardize patient
			 safety;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas exposure to environmental toxicants has the
			 potential to impact the health of women, and the health of future
			 generations;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas intimate partner violence affects 1,500,000 women
			 each year and 324,000 pregnant women each year; the direct effects can include
			 miscarriage and fetal injury or death, and the indirect effects can include
			 delayed prenatal care, smoking, and drug and alcohol abuse;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is a known link between intimate partner
			 violence and reproductive coercion, which occurs whenever a partner tries to
			 stop a woman from making her own decisions about pregnancy, such as interfering
			 with contraception use, forcing sex, or pressuring her to continue or end a
			 pregnancy;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a woman must be supported not only in the decision
			 to carry a pregnancy to term, but be empowered to navigate the complexities of
			 parenthood including the role as primary, and in some cases the sole
			 breadwinner, active caregiver, employee trying to fulfill their job
			 responsibilities, and primary health care decision maker within the
			 family;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas 80 percent of all caregivers are women, and
			 approximately half of those women provide care and support for both children
			 under the age of 18 and an older relative, and make health care decisions for
			 at least one other person in the household besides themselves;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas women are now the sole breadwinners or
			 co-breadwinners in the majority of United States households;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the lack of pay equity forces women to choose
			 between necessities for their family, like food, shelter, and clothing, and
			 critical health care needs for family members in the home;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas 43 percent of working women lack the workplace
			 flexibility or have family friendly workplace policies that ensure that they
			 can provide for their family during medical emergencies, effectively use the
			 preventative health care services available to them and their dependents, and
			 stay in the workforce as long as necessary to provide financial stability for
			 their family;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas less than half of working women have access to any
			 paid parental leave, while paid leave after the birth of a child leads to
			 better health outcomes, higher rates of breastfeeding and for longer duration,
			 and better maternal employment outcomes and higher wages;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas more than 40 percent of working women do not have
			 a single earned sick day to care for themselves or their family;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Pregnancy Discrimination Act">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</cato:entity-ref> prevents
			 discrimination of pregnant women in the workplace, yet many women still face
			 pregnancy discrimination, such as being denied requests for reasonable
			 workplace accommodations to continue working while pregnant; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas women rely on Social Security for a larger share
			 of their retirement income including 23 percent of older women who rely on
			 Social Security for 100 percent of their income: Now, therefore, be it</text>
