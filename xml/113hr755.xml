        <text>The unpaid

        <text>During the war,

        <text>This extraordinary

        <text>The CAP was
			 established, initially as a part of the Office of Civil Defense, by air-minded

        <text>Within days of the

        <text>Neither the Navy
			 nor the Army had enough aircraft, ships, or other resources to adequately
			 patrol and protect the shipping along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of

        <text>The CAP used a

        <text>The initial
