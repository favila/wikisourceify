	<preamble>
		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the civil war in Syria, which exploded when the
			 dictatorial regime of Bashar al Assad violently suppressed peaceful
			 demonstrations by Syria’s citizens, has killed more than 70,000 Syrians,
			 created as many as 4,000,000 internally displaced, and driven some 1,200,000 to
			 seek refuge in neighboring countries, mobilizing an international response
			 encompassing pledges of assistance totaling over $1,000,000,000;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the 40-year history of undemocratic, repressive
			 leadership under the regime of Bashar al Assad and his father Hafez al Assad
			 has eroded civil society, debilitated the capacity for self government, and
			 undermined confidence in the rule of law in Syria;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Syrian opposition, though lacking
			 comprehensive and coordinated assistance from the international community, and
			 suffering constant attacks by the Assad regime, has succeeded in establishing
			 effective self-government in significant sections of the country and is
			 developing a capacity to exercise responsible authority and deliver essential
			 services;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States Government recognizes the Syrian
			 Opposition Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people and
			 is assisting the Council and its affiliated local coordinating bodies to
			 establish structures of governance, including mechanisms for the provision of
			 security and justice;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Syrian population is about 70 percent Sunni
			 and also includes large minorities of Alawites and Christians (including Greek
			 Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and Eastern Rite Catholics), as
			 well as smaller numbers of Shia (including Ismailis), Druze, Ezidi, Mandaean,
			 and Jewish communities with longstanding ancient and indigenous ties to the
			 area;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas according to the February 5, 2013, Report of the
			 Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic,
			 the conflict is becoming increasingly sectarian;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Syrian Government has sought to exacerbate
			 ethnic and religious tensions by employing paramilitary forces, known as
			 shabiha, to terrorize communities suspected of sympathizing with the
			 opposition, and has thus sown the seeds of unbridled sectarian conflict;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas elements of the opposition have reportedly engaged
			 in isolated instances of attacks on religious shrines in areas of mixed
			 ethnicity, which if they become more widespread jeopardize a transition to a
			 post-conflict, democratic, and pluralistic Syria; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas members of the international community, notably
			 Iran, Russia, and China, have undermined international consensus for a peaceful
			 resolution of the conflict, stymied efforts to halt the Syrian Government’s
			 atrocities, maintained military support for Bashar al Assad’s onslaught against
			 civilians, or blocked action at the United Nations Security Council: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
