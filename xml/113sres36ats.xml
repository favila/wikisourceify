		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the roots of Mosaic, a faith-based organization
			 that serves individuals with intellectual disabilities, trace back to the
			 commitment of a Nebraskan to ensure that individuals with disabilities were
			 cared for and inspired by a loving community;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on February 19, 1913, a Nebraska pastor, the
			 Reverend K.G. William Dahl, founded Bethphage Inner Mission Association
			 (referred to in this preamble as <quote>Bethphage</quote>) in Axtell, Nebraska
			 as a ministry for individuals with intellectual disabilities;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on October 20, 1925, a school endeavoring to
			 create opportunities for children with disabilities took root in Sterling,
			 Nebraska when the Reverends Julius Moehl, August Hoeger, and William Fruehling,
			 and laymen John Aden and William Ehmen, established Martin Luther Home Society,
			 which later became known as Martin Luther Homes;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, with the increasing need for community-based
			 programs for individuals with disabilities in the 1970s and 1980s, both
			 Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes grew into ministries that served locations
			 across the United States;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the shared vision and mission of the 2
			 Nebraska-born ministries, to care for the most vulnerable individuals, laid the
			 foundation for the formation of a powerful partnership;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on July 1, 2003, Mosaic was officially
			 established through a consolidation of Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes;
			 and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Mosaic has created a legacy of love, providing
			 individualized support to thousands of individuals in the United States and
			 extending its work beyond the borders of the United States through an
			 international alliance: Now therefore be it</text>
