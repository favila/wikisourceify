		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas Holoprosencephaly (commonly known as
			 <quote>HPE</quote>) is a birth defect of the brain in which the prosencephalon
			 (also known as the <quote>embryonic forebrain</quote>) does not sufficiently
			 develop into 2 hemispheres resulting in a single-lobed brain structure and
			 severe skull and facial defects;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in most cases of HPE, the malformations are so
			 severe that babies die before birth;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in less severe cases of HPE, babies are born with
			 normal or near-normal brain development and facial deformities that may affect
			 the eyes, nose, and upper lip;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the 3 classifications of HPE that vary in severity
			 and impairment to cognitive abilities are Alobar (in which the brain has not
			 divided at all), Semilobar (in which the hemispheres of the brain have somewhat
			 divided), and Lobar (in which there is considerable evidence of separate brain
			 hemispheres);</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas HPE affects approximatley 1 out of every 250
			 pregnancies during early embryo development, with many of those pregnancies
			 ending in miscarriage;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas HPE affects 1 in 10,000–20,000 live births;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the prognosis for a child diagnosed with HPE
			 depends on the severity of the brain and facial malformations and associated
			 clinical complications, with the most severely affected children living several
			 months or years and the least affected children living a normal life
			 span;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is no standard course of treatment for HPE
			 because treatment must be individualized to the unique degree of malformations
			 of each child;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Federal Government, acting through the
			 <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="7529">National Institutes of Health</cato:entity-ref> and the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-parent-id="7529" value="National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes">National Institute of Neurological
			 Disorders and Strokes</cato:entity-ref>, supports and conducts a wide range of research on normal
			 brain development and recent research has identified specific genes that cause
			 HPE; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas November 28, 2013, would be an appropriate day to
			 designate as <quote>National Holoprosencephaly Awareness Day</quote>: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
