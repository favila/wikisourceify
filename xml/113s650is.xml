        <text>In order to meet

        <text>The National

			 the continuing role of licensed independent insurance producers in health
			 insurance, and has expressed that the ability of insurance agents and brokers
			 to continue assisting health insurance consumers at a time of rapid insurance
			 market changes is more essential than ever. On November 22, 2011, the NAIC
			 adopted a resolution stating that <quote>Congress should expeditiously consider
			 legislation amending the MLR provisions of the <cato:entity-ref xmlns:cato="http://namespaces.cato.org/catoxml" entity-type="act" value="Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act">PPACA</cato:entity-ref> in order to preserve
