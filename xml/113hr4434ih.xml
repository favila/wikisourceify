        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The proliferation of terrorist groups is rampant in unstable countries in West and sub-Saharan
			 Africa. The biggest regional threats include al-Qaeda in the Islamic
			 Maghreb (AQIM), which has known ties to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
			 (AQAP), Boko Haram, and al-Shabab. The opportunity to expand the strategic
			 reach and force projection of the United States into the theater of
			 operations of the United States Africa Command (in this Act referred to as <quote>AFRICOM</quote>) is now. With the United States strategic pivot to the Pacific now underway, the need to ensure
			 retention of a strong Atlantic presence is a vital and delicate aspect of

			 maintaining a United States-based headquarters for AFRICOM would be $60
			 million to $70 million less than the cost of operating the AFRICOM
			 headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. The annual cost of providing AFRICOM
			 personnel with overseas housing and cost-of-living pay was $81 million per
			 year, compared with the $19 million to $25 million these would cost if the
			 personnel were located in the United States. The break-even point to
			 recover one-time relocation costs to the United States would be reached
			 between 2 and 6 years after relocation, depending on the costs to
			 establish facilities in the United States. Relocating AFRICOM to the
			 continental United States could create up to 4,300 additional jobs, with
			 an annual impact on the local economy ranging from $350 million to $450
			 million.</text>

        <text>In April 2013, after the decision had been made to maintain AFRICOM headquarters in Germany,
			 <cato:entity-ref xmlns:cato="http://namespaces.cato.org/catoxml" entity-id="9700" entity-type="federal-body">Secretary of Defense</cato:entity-ref> Chuck Hagel called on the Department to challenge all
			 past assumptions in order to seek cost savings and efficiencies in <quote>a time of unprecedented shifts in the world order, new global challenges, and deep global fiscal
			 uncertainty</quote>, to explore the full range of options for implementing United States national security strategy,
			 and to <quote>put everything on the table</quote>. The Secretary stated that the size and shape of the military forces should constantly be
			 reassessed. He stated that this reassessment should include determining
			 the most appropriate balance between forward-stationed, ro­ta­tion­al­ly
			 deployed, and home-based forces.</text>

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">It is within the strategic and fiscal responsibility of Congress to fully analyze and provide for
			 the implementation of any consolidation of military installations. There
			 are more than 110,000 troops and civilians stationed and employed at 29
			 military installations in Europe. Priority should be given to
			 consolidating bases that are in close proximity to each other and that can
			 achieve cost savings without detriment to operational readiness, such as
			 Royal Air Force Station Mildenhall and Royal Air Force Station Lakenheath,
			 as well as Moron Air Base, Spain, and Naval Station Rota, Spain.</text>

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Of particular concern is the decision to deploy assets to Moron Air Base, where the readiness and
			 effectiveness of deployed troops is hindered by the lack of infrastructure
			 to house, train, and equip them. Specifically, Moron lacks the facilities
			 to properly perform ground and naval training operations, and only has
			 limited ability to accomplish air training operations. By contrast, Lajes
			 Field has implemented more than $150 million of major infrastructure
			 upgrades over the past 12 years to improve the quality of life, upgrade
			 communication capabilities, bolster security, and enhance military
			 operations. With a nearby port, sprawling fields, and unrestricted
			 airspace, Lajes Field has the unique ability to host extensive air,
			 ground, and naval training operations. Lajes’ strategic location,
			 infrastructure improvements, unrestricted air space, and outstanding
			 training environment for all forces make this an indispensable asset and
			 an ideal forward operating base for AFRICOM, as opposed to spending
			 hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade aging sites such as Moron Air
			 Base, Spain.</text>
