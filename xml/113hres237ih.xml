		<whereas>

			 the brain is interrupted by a clot in the artery or a burst of the
			 artery;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause
			 permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly diagnosed and
			 treated;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas stroke occurs in approximately 1 out of every
			 3,500 live births, and affects nearly 5 out of every 100,000 children age 19
			 and under each year;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a stroke can occur before birth;</text>
		</whereas>

      <text>Whereas stroke recurs in 10 percent of children who have
			 previously experienced a stroke;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the death rate for children who experience a
			 stroke before the age of 1 year is the highest out of all child age
			 groups;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas treatment of stroke in adults using thrombolytic
			 therapy within 3 to 6 hours of the onset of symptoms is the cornerstone of
			 acute stroke treatment, but thrombolytic therapy is generally not recommended
			 in children;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas approximately 60 percent of infants and children
			 who have a pediatric stroke will have serious, permanent neurological
			 disabilities, including paralysis, seizures, speech and vision problems, and
			 attention, learning, and behavioral difficulties;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical
			 therapy and surgeries;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>

			 resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young adulthood have a
			 considerable impact on children, families, and society;</text>

      <text>Whereas not enough is known about the cause, treatment,
			 and prevention of pediatric stroke;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas medical research is the only means by which the
			 people of the United States can identify and develop effective treatment and
			 prevention strategies for pediatric stroke; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric stroke
			 greatly improves the chances that the affected child will recover and not
			 experience a recurrence: Now, therefore, be it</text>
