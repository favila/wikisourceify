          <text>The Naugatuck River Valley is comprised of 14 communities along the Naugatuck River, which
			 stretches for more than 40 miles from its headwaters in Torrington,
			 Connecticut, to the confluence with the Housatonic River in Shelton. The
			 14 municipalities of Torrington, Harwinton, Litchfield,
			 Plymouth/Terryville, Thomaston, Waterbury, Watertown, Ansonia, Beacon
			 Falls, Derby, Naugatuck, Oxford, Seymour, and Shelton, share common
			 historical elements, agricultural, trade, and maritime origins, similar
			 architecture, common industries, an immigrant culture succeeding colonial
			 beginnings, and a significant contribution to the war effort from the
			 Revolutionary War to World War II. Most of these elements are still in
			 evidence today.</text>

          <text>Three major industries drove the manufacturing contribution of the Valley. As evidenced in the
			 book, The Brass Industry in the United States, by William Lathrop, the
			 brass industry was born in Connecticut’s Naugatuck River Valley and
			 harnessed the power of the Naugatuck River and the skilled immigrant
			 workers who arrived from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Poland.</text>

          <text>The Naugatuck River Valley also spawned the birth of the rubber industry in the United States when
			 Charles Goodyear developed the vulcanization process in 1839. Together
			 with Samuel Lewis, a wealthy industrialist from Naugatuck, Connecticut,
			 Goodyear parlayed his innovation into establishing the U.S. Rubber
			 Company, making Naugatuck the rubber capital of the world.</text>

          <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Naugatuck River Valley was also a major contributor to the success of the United States clock
			 industry. Eli Terry designed interchangeable parts for his clocks
			 assembled in Terryville. Renowned clockmaker Seth Thomas began making the
			 first of millions of clocks in Thomaston, Connecticut, in 1813. His
			 company continued until 1931 when it became a division of General Time
			 Corporation (Timex). Other important industries included pens, evaporated
			 milk, pianos and organs, corset stays, and cables.</text>

          <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Naugatuck River Valley has been a major contributor to the United States war efforts from the
			 American Revolution to the Civil War to World War II. In the 2007 PBS film
			 “The War”, the story of World War II directed and produced by Ken
			 Burns and Lynn Novick, the City of Waterbury, Connecticut, was
			 characterized as the “arsenal” of the war effort because of its high
			 concentration of war industries.</text>

			 first American ambassador; Commodore Isaac Hull, Commander of “Old
			 Ironsides” during the War of 1812; Ebenezer D. Bassett, the country’s
			 first black ambassador; Dr. John Howe, inventor of a pin making machine
			 that made the common pin a household necessity; and Pierre Lallement,
			 inventor of the modern two-wheel bicycle.</text>

          <text>The Naugatuck River Valley possesses a rich and diverse assemblage of architecturally significant
			 civic, industrial and residential structures and monuments dating from
			 Colonial times to the present. There are 88 structures in the Naugatuck
			 Valley included on the National Register of Historic Places. The first law
			 school in America was built in Litchfield. Notable examples of the variety
			 of architecture found in the Valley include Robert Wakeman Hill’s
			 brilliantly designed Thomaston Opera House and Town Hall; H.E. Ficken’s
			 acoustically impressive Sterling Opera House in Derby, site of appearances
			 by many nationally known performers; Waterbury’s Clock Tower, designed by
			 the renowned architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White which also designed four buildings in Naugatuck; Henry Bacon, designer of the Lincoln
			 Memorial and two structures in Naugatuck; and the Father McGivney Statue
