		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is a growing humanitarian crisis along the international border between the United

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States welcomes lawful immigrants and has established appropriate channels for

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, since October 2013, officials in the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="7000" entity-type="federal-body">Department of Homeland Security</cato:entity-ref> have apprehended more
			 than 47,000 unaccompanied migrant children after they crossed that border
			 without legal authorization;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the majority of these children have arrived in the United States through the Rio Grande
			 Valley Sector in Texas but the effects of this surge in illegal
			 immigration have been felt across the United States;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas this surge in illegal immigration has undermined the ability of the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="7000" entity-type="federal-body">Department of Homeland
			 Security</cato:entity-ref> and other law enforcement agencies to protect the United States
			 from criminal and national security threats;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the vast majority of these children have traveled to the United States from countries in
			 Central America, a journey of more than 1,000 miles that traverses some of
			 the most dangerous territory in the Western Hemisphere and smuggling
			 routes operated by drug cartels and other transnational criminal
			 organizations;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas these transnational criminal organizations routinely commit acts of human trafficking,
			 sexual assault, exploitation, kidnapping, and homicide against children
			 who are the victims of their human smuggling operations;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas children making this journey face other grave dangers such as riding on top of crowded
			 railroad cars, dehydration, heat exposure, and drowning;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is unknown how many children making this journey have perished or become victims of
			 violent crime while traveling to the United States;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is the duty of the United States Government to identify and provide humanitarian relief

      <text>Whereas the current and previous administration, each headed by a <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1100">President</cato:entity-ref> belonging to a

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, beginning in 2010, President <cato:entity-ref entity-type="person" entity-id="O000167">Obama</cato:entity-ref> and the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="7000" entity-type="federal-body">Secretary of Homeland Security</cato:entity-ref> announced a
			 series of executive actions, public statements, and enforcement decisions

			 created a misperception outside of the United States that children
			 entering the United States without legal authorization will receive relief
			 from immigration enforcement consequences;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas these executive actions and the continuing failures of President <cato:entity-ref entity-type="person" entity-id="O000167">Obama</cato:entity-ref> and the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="7000" entity-type="federal-body">Secretary of

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the failure of the United States Government to enforce the immigration laws has undermined

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="0010" entity-type="federal-body">Senate</cato:entity-ref> must do everything in its power to mitigate the growing humanitarian threat

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas this cannot be accomplished until President <cato:entity-ref entity-type="person" entity-id="O000167">Obama</cato:entity-ref> has demonstrated to people of the United
