  <preamble>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program (hereinafter referred to as the <quote>EUC Program</quote>) was created on June 30, 2008, when President George W. Bush signed the <cato:entity entity-type="law-citation">
          <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008">Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008</cato:entity-ref> (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/110/252">
          <cato:entity-ref entity-type="public-law" value="public-law/110/252">Public Law 110â€“252</cato:entity-ref>
        </external-xref>)</cato:entity> into law;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the EUC Program is the 8th time Congress has created a Federal temporary program that has extended unemployment compensation during an economic slowdown;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the authorization for the EUC Program expires December 28, 2013;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas unless the EUC Program is extended, more than 1,300,000 jobless workers will have their benefits cut off on December 28, 2013, and nearly another 1,900,000 jobless workers will lose their unemployment benefits between January 1 and June 30, 2014;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is estimated that failure to extend the EUC Program will result in a loss of 310,000 jobs next year because of reduced consumer demand;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is estimated that failure to extend the EUC Program will reduce economic growth by as much as 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2014;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0800">Congressional Budget Office</cato:entity-ref> reported in 2012 that assistance for the unemployed has one of the <quote>largest effects on employment per dollar of budgetary cost</quote> because financially stressed unemployed workers spend any benefits they receive quickly;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas failure to extend the EUC Program will further hurt an economy already injured by the loss of an estimated 750,000 jobs resulting from budget cuts mandated by sequestration and the loss of more than 120,000 jobs in the first 2 weeks of October 2013 as a consequence of the shutdown of the Federal Government;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas 36 percent of unemployed workers have been out of work for more than 6 months, in part because the national economy still has 2,000,000 fewer jobs than before the Great Recession began in 2008; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas if <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref> does not act immediately to extend these benefits, a devastating blow will be dealt not only to the millions of Americans who are already struggling, but to our economy: Now, therefore, be it</text>
