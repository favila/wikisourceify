	<preamble>
		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas tens of thousands of women and girls have been
			 victims of sexual or gender-based violence in Haiti, particularly in times of
			 conflict or natural disaster;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas women’s rights groups in Haiti have witnessed
			 dramatic increases in rates of sexual violence in many of the displacement
			 camps established after the earthquake;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas approximately 50 percent of the victims are
			 adolescent girls under the age of 18, with many of the cases involving the use
			 of weapons, gang rape, and death threats for reporting the crime;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas medical providers have reported as many as 20
			 percent of adolescent victims of sexual violence becoming pregnant as a result
			 of rape;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas inadequate financial, human, and technical
			 resources, as well as a lack of forensic and technical expertise, have impeded
			 the arrest and prosecution of suspects;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas members of many medical professions are
			 insufficiently trained to attend to the special needs of victims of
			 gender-based violence, whether they be children or adults;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas according to data from public interest law firms
			 involved in prosecuting cases of sexual violence, significant gender-based
			 barriers to justice continue to exist at all levels of the Haitian justice
			 system;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas members of the police, prosecutors, and judges are
			 insufficiently trained to attend to either the special needs of victims of
			 gender-based violence, or the special needs of those individuals who are
			 victims of other abuses such as forced labor, beatings, or violence;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the special police unit to address gender-based
			 violence within the Haitian National Police remains significantly
			 under-resourced, rendering it practically ineffective to carry out its
			 mandate;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas few mechanisms exist in Haiti to protect the
			 rights of young children not living at home, such as restaveks, who are engaged
			 in forced labor and especially vulnerable to sexual violence;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the lack of physical protection discourages women
			 and girls in Haiti from pursuing prosecution of perpetrators of sexual
			 violence, for fear of reprisal or stigmatization;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas rape and other forms of gender-based violence in
			 Haiti threaten the physical and psychological health of both the victims and
			 their families;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas an effective, transparent, and impartial judicial
			 system is key to the administration of justice, and the failure to ensure
			 proper investigations and prosecutions undermines the ability to hold
			 perpetrators accountable for their crimes and discourages victims from formally
			 seeking justice;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of Haiti has undertaken efforts to
			 prevent violence against women, as evidenced by its ratification of the United
			 Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
			 Women, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and
			 Eradication of Violence Against Women, and other international human rights
			 treaties, and the enactment of laws and the creation of state institutions to
			 promote and protect the rights of women;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Ministry for the Status of Women and Women’s
			 Rights in Haiti has been working on a comprehensive law that calls for the
			 prevention, punishment, and elimination of violence against women;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of Haiti has been a signatory of
			 the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child since December 29,
			 1994;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Haitian National Police and the United Nations
			 Mission for Stabilization of Haiti have created special police units to address
			 sexual and other forms of gender-based violence in Haiti;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United Nations and donor countries, including
			 the United States, continue to play a significant role in post-earthquake
			 stabilization and reconstruction of Haiti;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="7200">United States Agency for International
			 Development</cato:entity-ref> (USAID) has prioritized the prevention of, and response to,
			 gender-based violence as a priority in its work across all sectors and as an
			 explicit goal of the new USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment
			 Policy;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="7200">USAID</cato:entity-ref> and the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">United States Department of State</cato:entity-ref>
			 have been directed by Executive order of the President to implement a new
			 interagency United States Strategy To Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based
			 Violence Globally;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in March 2009, the Inter-American Commission on
			 Human Rights issued a report recognizing Haiti’s history of gender
			 discrimination that fuels gender-based violence and gives rise to a climate of
			 impunity; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in December 2010, the Inter-American Commission
			 detailed steps the Government of Haiti must take to protect women and girls
			 from increased risk of gender-based violence in post-earthquake Haiti: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
