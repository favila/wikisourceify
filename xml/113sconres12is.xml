		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas private retirement plans in the United States paid
			 out over $3,824,000,000,000 in benefits from 2000 through 2009, while public
			 sector retirement plans paid out $2,651,000,000,000 during the same period,
			 with both playing an essential role in providing retirement income for millions
			 of our Nation’s senior citizens;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there are approximately 670,000 private-sector
			 defined contribution plans that are currently covering 67,000,000 participants,
			 and over 48,000 private-sector defined benefit plans covering 44,000,000
			 participants;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas $4,700,000,000,000 is held in 401(k), 403(b), 457
			 and similar defined contribution plans, $2,300,000,000,000 is held in private
			 defined benefit plans, and another $4,900,000,000,000 is held in Individual
			 Retirement Accounts, largely consisting of funds rolled over from
			 employer-based retirement plans;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas from 2000 through 2009, employers have contributed
			 almost $3,500,000,000,000 to public and private retirement plans;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas tax incentives are an important impetus for
			 individuals to save for retirement and for employers to offer plans under our
			 voluntary system;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas generally, the taxation of amounts contributed to
			 pension and retirement plans is simply deferred, not lost;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas more than 70 percent of American workers making
			 between $30,000 and $50,000 a year contribute to their own retirement when
			 covered by a retirement plan at work;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas under current law, if business owners and managers
			 sponsor a retirement plan, they also must cover and provide benefits to
			 lower-income and middle-income employees;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas 401(k) and similar defined contribution plans have
			 been enhanced over the years by <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref> on a bipartisan basis;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the private retirement system in the United States
			 is voluntary and is dependent on the willingness of business owners and
			 corporations to adopt and maintain retirement plans; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States system of employer-based
			 retirement savings is designed to work together with other personal savings and
			 the Social Security program to provide meaningful income replacement upon
			 retirement: Now, therefore, be it</text>
		</whereas>
