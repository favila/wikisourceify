			 businesses and non-profits, parents and students: if you set and enforce
			 rigorous and challenging standards and assessments; if you put outstanding
			 teachers at the front of the classroom; if you turn around failing

      <text>Whereas the selection criteria designed by the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="9100">Department of Education</cato:entity-ref> for the Race to the Top

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on July 24, 2009, Secretary Duncan stated, <quote>To speed this process, the Race to the Top program is going to set aside $350,000,000 to

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas when Federal funds are linked to the adoption of common education standards, the end result

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the implementation of Common Core State Standards will eventually impact home school and

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the 10th amendment of the Constitution of the United States reads, <quote>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the
