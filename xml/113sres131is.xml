	<preamble>
		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on December 14, 1995, the General Framework
			 Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (referred to in this resolution
			 as <quote>BiH</quote>), known as the Dayton Peace Accords, brought an end to
			 the brutal conflict in that country that was marked by aggression and ethnic
			 cleansing, including the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and
			 genocide;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords define BiH as a country
			 with three constituent peoples—Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs—to be comprised of
			 two internal entities known as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH)
			 and Republika Srpska (RS), from which an extremely complex, fundamentally
			 flawed system of governance and administration has been derived;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords included many compromises
			 imposed by the need for quick action to preserve human life and bring an end to
			 the conflict in BiH, and as a result may have hindered efforts to develop
			 efficient and effective political institutions capable of overcoming the
			 challenges required to become an integral member of the Euro-Atlantic community
			 of nation-states;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, since the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords,
			 the Government and people of BiH have been working in partnership with the
			 international community to achieve progress in building a peaceful and
			 democratic society based on the rule of law, respect for human rights, and a
			 free market economy;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas BiH demonstrated its commitment to the shared
			 values of democracy, security, and stability by joining the Partnership for
			 Peace program of the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="19RN">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</cato:entity-ref> (NATO) in December
			 2006;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas BiH received a conditional Membership Action Plan
			 status in <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="19RN">NATO</cato:entity-ref> in April 2010 pending completion of specific military and
			 political reforms;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of BiH took the first important
			 step on the road toward European Union (EU) membership by signing a
			 Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU in June 2008;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, despite these notable achievements, the
			 Government and people of BiH continue to face significant challenges in their
			 efforts at integrating into Euro-Atlantic institutions and the country’s
			 economy continues to decline;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission
			 concluded that the current constitutional arrangements in BiH are not conducive
			 to the efficient or rational functioning of state institutions, hindering the
			 pace of the country’s accession to NATO and the EU;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of BiH has the obligation to
			 implement the ruling of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights
			 in the case of Sejdić-Finci from 2009 with regard to the election to the
			 Presidency and House of Peoples of BiH of Others, who are defined as those
			 Bosnian citizens who are not primarily a member of the Dayton Accords'
			 stipulated three constitutive peoples—the Serb Bosnians, the Croat Bosnians,
			 and the Muslim Bosnians or Bosniaks;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas reform at any level, including that originating
			 from the implementation of the European Court of Human Rights ruling on the
			 Sejdić-Finci Case, should take into account the protection of equal
			 constitutional rights of all;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the elections in BiH should reflect the right of
			 the constituent peoples and others to choose their legal representatives, who
			 would therefore represent those people consistent with the founding provisions
			 of the Dayton Peace Accords, as opposed to the existing practice, which allows
			 for the representatives of one people to be elected by the members of other
			 constituent peoples, hindering the political stability of BiH;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas only the full protection of equal political,
			 economic, legal, and religious rights of all the constituent peoples and others
			 throughout the territory of BiH, including the inalienable right to return,
			 will guarantee the future stability, functionality, and effectiveness of the
			 country;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the number of Bosnian Croats has declined from
			 820,000 before the war to around 460,000 remaining in BiH today, as reported by
			 the Catholic Church in BiH which has played an important role in protecting
			 rights of Catholic Bosnian Croats and reporting problems and cases of
			 destruction of personal and real property of both the Catholic Church and Croat
			 returnees;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is not acceptable that this negative
			 demographic trend is reflected in the reduction of constitutional rights of
			 Bosnian Croats, as that reduction directly causes political and administrative
			 dysfunctionality of the country;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a functional BiH as a whole is not possible
			 without a fully functional FBiH, one of the two entities established by the
			 Dayton Peace Accords, both being ethnically and administratively
			 composite;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas FBiH’s protracted poor functionality only
			 exacerbates the existing predominant separatist tendency in the RS, the
			 predominantly Serb entity of BiH, thus threatening the very integrity of the
			 country as a whole;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas continuous economic decline is a direct
			 consequence of the fact that most of BiH’s gross domestic product (GDP) is
			 generated from the publicly owned companies, which are run at the RS and FBiH
			 entity levels by political parties with enduring ethnocentric agendas
			 reflecting their particular and non-common interests, preventing the further
			 creation of much-needed free enterprise business development and closely
			 integrated national internal markets;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the social fabric of BiH is the single most
			 important victim of the war and ensuing political conflict, and the need for
			 repair, strengthening, and further development of civil society is fundamental
			 to the country’s recovery and desired development;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Republic of Croatia has clearly demonstrated
			 that allegiance to democracy, market economy, rule of law, and respect for
			 human and citizen rights is conducive to full integration into the
			 Euro-Atlantic community, and the Government of Croatia continues to play an
			 active role in contributing to BiH’s political stability, internal integrity,
			 and international viability;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas all the other neighbors of BiH share the ambition
			 to join the European Union; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the future of BiH is in the European Union and
			 <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="19RN">NATO</cato:entity-ref>: Now, therefore, be it</text>
		</whereas>
