    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, under great urgency and before adequate time could be dedicated to researching the history of the Iraqi Jewish Archive, an agreement was signed between the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="8800" entity-type="federal-body">National Archives and Records Administration</cato:entity-ref> and the Coalition Provisional Authority on August 20, 2003, stating that the Iraqi Jewish Archive would be sent to the United States for restoration and then would be sent back to Iraq after completion;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas United States taxpayers have invested $3,000,000 to restore the Iraqi Jewish Archive, and the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="8800" entity-type="federal-body">National Archives and Records Administration</cato:entity-ref> has worked diligently to preserve the artifacts;</text>

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
