		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas participants in the school breakfast program
			 established by <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Child Nutrition Act of 1966/s:4">section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966</cato:entity-ref> include public,
			 private, elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as rural, suburban, and
			 urban schools;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas school breakfast programs were developed across
			 the Nation in response to a simple problem, too many children were going to
			 school without breakfast or without a nutritionally adequate breakfast;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in the 2011 to 2012 school year, approximately
			 12,530,000 students in 89,666 schools participated in the school breakfast
			 program on a typical day;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in the 2011 to 2012 school year, approximately
			 10,500,000 low-income children in the United States consumed free or reduced
			 price school breakfasts on an average school day;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in the 2011 to 2012 school year, 91.2 percent of
			 schools that participated in the school lunch program established under the
			 <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act">Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act</cato:entity-ref> also participated in the school
			 breakfast program;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas for every 100 children receiving free and reduced
			 price lunches, approximately 50.4 children receive free and reduced price
			 breakfasts;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in the 2011 to 2012 school year, 84 percent of
			 school breakfasts served, were served to students who qualified for free or
			 reduced priced meals;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas if 70 low-income children ate breakfast for every
			 100 children who ate lunch, an additional 4,100,000 low-income children would
			 eat school breakfast;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas implementing or improving classroom breakfast
			 programs has been shown to increase the participation of eligible students in
			 breakfast consumption dramatically, doubling, and in some cases tripling
			 numbers, as evidenced by research conducted in the States of Minnesota, New
			 York, and Wisconsin;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas making breakfast widely available through
			 different venues or combinations, such as in the classroom after the morning
			 bell, obtained as students exit a school bus, or outside the classroom, has
			 been shown to lessen the stigma of receiving free or reduced price breakfasts,
			 which often deters eligible students from obtaining traditional breakfasts in
			 the cafeteria;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas providing free universal breakfasts, especially in
			 the classroom, has been shown to significantly increase school breakfast
			 participation rates and decrease absences and tardiness;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas studies have shown that access to nutritious meals
			 under the school lunch program and the school breakfast program helps to create
			 a strong learning environment for children and helps to improve the
			 concentration of children in the classroom;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas providing breakfast in the classroom has been
			 shown in several instances to improve attentiveness and academic performance,
			 while reducing tardiness and disciplinary referrals;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas students who eat a complete breakfast have been
			 shown to make fewer mistakes and work faster in math exercises than students
			 who eat a partial breakfast;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas studies suggest that eating breakfast closer to
			 classroom and test-taking time improves student performance on standardized
			 tests relative to students who skip breakfast;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas studies show that students who skip breakfast are
			 more likely to have difficulty distinguishing among similar images, show
			 increased errors, and have slower memory recall;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas children who live in families that experience
			 hunger have been shown to be more likely to have lower math scores, face an
			 increased likelihood of repeating a grade, and receive more special education
			 services;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas studies suggest that children who eat breakfast
			 have more adequate nutrition and intake of nutrients, such as calcium, fiber,
			 protein, and vitamins A, E, D, and B6;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas studies show that children who participate in
			 school breakfast programs eat more fruits, drink more milk, and consume less
			 saturated fat than children who do not eat breakfast;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas National School Breakfast Week is an annual
			 occasion for everyone in the community to reflect on the importance and value
			 of what breakfast in schools means for all children in the United States and is
			 a time to renew the commitment to the idea that all children should be able to
			 start the school day adequately fed and ready to learn; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas March 4 through March 8, 2013, is National School
			 Breakfast Week: Now, therefore, be it</text>
