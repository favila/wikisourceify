			 African-American men will be disenfranchised at some point during their
			 lifetimes. Currently, 1 of every 13 African-Americans are rendered unable
			 to vote because of felony disenfranchisement, a rate 4 times greater than
			 non African-Americans (7.7 percent of African-Americans versus 1.8 percent
			 of non African-Americans). In 3 States (Florida, 23 percent; Kentucky, 22
			 percent; and Virginia, 20 percent) more than 1 in 5 African-Americans are

			 When analyzing the data across 10 States, Latinos generally have
			 disproportionately higher rates of disenfranchisement compared to their
