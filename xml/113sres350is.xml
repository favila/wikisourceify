      <text>Whereas on February 14 of each year, medical professionals and students stand in solidarity to
			 support
			 compassion in health care as expressed by Dr. Randall Friese, triage
			 physician
			 at the University of Arizona Medical Center, who stated that the most
			 important
			 treatment he provided to Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords after she was
			 shot
			 on January 8, 2011, was to hold her hand and reassure her that she was in
			 the
			 hospital and would be cared for;</text>

			 compassion in health care encourages health care professionals to be

      <text>Whereas scientific research reveals that when health
			 care professionals practice humanistically and demonstrate the qualities
			 of
			 integrity, compassion, altruism, respect, empathy, and service,
			 their patients have better medical outcomes; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas February 14th would be an appropriate day to
			 designate as National Solidarity Day for Compassionate Patient Care and
			 for health care students and professionals to celebrate by performing
			 humanistic acts of
			 compassion and kindness toward patients, families of patients, and health
			 care
			 colleagues: Now, therefore, be it</text>
