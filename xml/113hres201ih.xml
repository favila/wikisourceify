    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas nurses are known to be patient advocates, acting
			 fearlessly to protect the lives of those under their care;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas nurses represent the largest single component of

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Institute of Medicine’s Future of Nursing
			 report has called for the nursing profession to optimize its contribution to
			 better meet the needs of all patients for quality health care;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas when nurse staffing levels increase, the risk of
			 patient complications and length of hospital stays decrease, resulting in cost
			 savings;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas nurses are experienced researchers, and their work
			 encompasses a wide scope of scientific inquiry including clinical research,
			 health systems and outcomes research, and nursing education research;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas nurses provide culturally and ethnically competent
			 care and are increasingly being educated to be sensitive to regional and

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas nurses help inform and educate the public to
			 improve the practice of all nurses and, more importantly, the health and safety

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the nationwide nursing shortage has caused
			 dedicated nurses to work longer hours and care for more acutely ill

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas nurses are strong allies to<cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref>as they help

			 health and safety of the patients they care for; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas increased Federal and State support is needed to
			 enhance existing programs and create new programs to educate nursing students
			 at all levels, to increase the number of faculty members to educate nursing
			 students, to create clinical sites and have the appropriately prepared nurses
			 to teach and train at those sites, to create educational opportunities to
			 retain nurses in the profession, and to educate and train more nurse research
			 scientists who can discover new nursing care models to improve the health
			 status of the Nation’s diverse population: Now, therefore, be it</text>
