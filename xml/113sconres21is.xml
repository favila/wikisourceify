		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas safe and responsible production, transportation,
			 and use of oil and petroleum products provide the foundation of the energy
			 economy of the United States, helping to secure and advance the economic
			 prosperity, national security, and overall quality of life in the United
			 States;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Keystone XL pipeline would provide short- and
			 long-term employment opportunities and related labor income benefits, such as
			 government revenues associated with taxes;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and
			 approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding that the
			 concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on the pipeline reroute and
			 that the reroute will have minimal environmental impacts;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> and other Federal agencies
			 have conducted extensive studies and analysis over a long period of time on the
			 technical, environmental, social, and economic impact of the proposed Keystone
			 XL pipeline;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas assessments by the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> found that
			 the Keystone XL pipeline is <quote>not likely to impact the amount of crude oil
			 produced from the oil sands</quote> and that <quote>approval or denial of the
			 proposed Project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of
			 development in the oil sands</quote>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> found that the incremental
			 life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Keystone XL project are
			 estimated in the range of 0.07 to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
			 equivalents, with the upper end of this range representing
			 <fraction>12/1,000</fraction> of 1 percent of the 6,702,000,000 metric tons of
			 carbon dioxide emitted in the United States in 2011;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas after extensive evaluation of potential impact to
			 land and water resources along the 875-mile proposed route of the Keystone XL
			 pipeline, the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> found, <quote>The analyses of potential
			 impacts associated with construction and normal operation of the proposed
			 Project suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most resources
			 along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with all laws and
			 required conditions and measures).</quote>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> found that <quote>[s]pills
			 associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment are expected to
			 be rare and relatively small</quote> and that <quote>there is no evidence of
			 increased corrosion or other pipeline threat due to viscosity</quote> of
			 diluted bitumen oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL
			 pipeline;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, the National Research Council convened a special
			 expert panel to review the risk of transporting diluted bitumen by pipeline and
			 issued a report in June 2013 to the Department of Transportation in which the
			 National Research Council found that existing literature indicates that
			 transportation of diluted bitumen poses no increased risk of pipeline
			 failure;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special
			 conditions relating to the design, construction, and operations of the Keystone
			 XL pipeline led the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> to find that the pipeline will have
			 <quote>a degree of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil
			 pipeline</quote>; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> found that oil destined
			 to be shipped through the pipeline from the oil sands region of Canada and oil
			 shale deposits in the United States would otherwise move by other modes of
			 transportation if the Keystone XL pipeline is not built: Now, therefore, be
			 it</text>
