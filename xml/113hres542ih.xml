		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas since fiscal year 2008, the annual regular-year United States bilateral assistance to the
			 West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged approximately $500 million,
			 including annual averages of approximately $200 million in direct
			 budgetary assistance and $100 million in non-lethal security assistance
			 for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="0500" entity-type="federal-body">Government Accountability Office</cato:entity-ref> has found some glaring insufficiencies in the vetting
			 process of the foreign aid grants to the Palestinian Authority and as such
			 it is very easy for United States foreign aid dollars to be used to
			 provide a monthly stipend for accused terrorists;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions 21 and 23 (2010) codified into law a
			 longstanding Palestinian Authority practice of providing a monthly salary
			 to <quote>anyone imprisoned in the occupation’s [Israel’s] prisons as a result of his participation in the
			 struggle against the occupation.</quote>; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, according to the Palestinian Authority’s definition, more than 4,500 Palestinian prisoners

			 recipients of salaries allocated from the Palestinian Authority’s general
			 salary budget that range from 2,400 to 12,000 shekels ($680 to $3,400) a
			 month: Now, therefore, be it</text>
