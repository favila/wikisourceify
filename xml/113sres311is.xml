			 to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport
			 practiced in accordance with Olympism and its values;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the role of the International Olympic Committee

			 public or private organizations and authorities in the endeavor to place sport
			 at the service of humanity and thereby promote peace;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, under the Olympic Charter, any form of
			 discrimination against a person is deemed incompatible with belonging to the
			 Olympic movement and the IOC is to act explicitly against any form of
			 discrimination affecting the Olympic movement;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in February 2014, the city of Sochi in the
			 Krasnodar region of the Russian Federation will host the 22nd Winter Olympic
			 Games;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on June 30, 2013, President Vladimir Putin of
			 Russian signed into law a bill that allows the Government of the Russian
			 Federation to arrest gay or “pro-gay” foreigners prior to being deported from
			 the country;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Krasnodar region of Russia, where the city of
			 Sochi is located, and 10 other regions have adopted similar laws banning
			 “homosexual propaganda”;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas several media outlets recently reported of
			 homophobic violence occurring in Russia resulting in the deaths of Russian
			 citizens;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas authorities in Russia have refused to register the
			 nongovernmental organization that would set up a Pride House in Sochi, which
			 would work to combat homophobia in sport and promote lesbian, gay, bisexual,
			 and transgendered (LGBT) individuals' rights during the Olympic Games in
			 Russia, as the Pride House did during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the presence of a Pride House would be the expression of human rights and have the mission of  celebrating diversity and inclusiveness through sport and raising awareness of LGBT discrimination and criminalization;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the IOC has said that they have received
			 assurances from the highest levels of the Government of the Russian Federation
			 that Olympic athletes and visitors will not be affected by Russia’s
			 discriminatory law, but the Minister of Sports in Russia has suggested that
			 athletes will not be exempt;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1900">Department of State</cato:entity-ref> has a clear and consistent
			 policy of championing the protection of human rights of LGBT individuals
			 worldwide, including by opposing any legislation that singles out people for
			 discriminatory treatment due to their sexual orientation and by encouraging
			 countries to repeal or reform laws that punish or criminalize LGBT
			 status;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Russia has obligated itself to respect and enforce
			 the right to be free from discrimination and the right to freedom of assembly,
			 association, and expression under the European Convention of Human Rights, the
			 United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the
			 human dimension commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
			 Europe; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the IOC recently stated, <quote>The International
			 Olympic Committee is clear that sport is a human right and should be available
			 to all regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation. The Games themselves
			 should be open to all, free of discrimination, and that applies to spectators,
			 officials, media and of course athletes. We oppose in the strongest terms any
			 move that would jeopardize this principle.</quote>: Now, therefore, be
			 it</text>
