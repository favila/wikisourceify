		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas to make up for budgetary shortfalls, foreign
			 governments have proposed to subject a one-time tax or fee on individual
			 deposit accounts in financial institutions in their countries;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas such proposals have incited public panic and
			 raised concerns that large numbers of bank customers may withdraw funds from
			 their depository institutions rapidly and simultaneously, also known as
			 <term>bank runs</term>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas such proposals have resulted in temporary capital
			 restrictions and bank closures in fear of prolonged bank runs;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas such proposals have resulted in bank customers
			 unable to withdraw funds during normal bank operating hours;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas federally insured deposit accounts help maintain
			 public confidence in the U.S. financial system;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas such a tax or fee would have a destabilizing
			 effect on American families, businesses, and the overall U.S. financial system;
			 and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a financial transaction tax or fee also would be
			 detrimental to average investors in towns all across America, suppress business
			 activity, and harm the U.S. economy from Main Street to Wall Street: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
