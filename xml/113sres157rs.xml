  <preamble>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas all people in the United States rely on quality,
			 efficient, and dependable telephone service in many aspects of life, including
			 conducting business, securing the safety of the public, and connecting
			 families;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas multiple surveys conducted by the National
			 Exchange Carrier Association revealed that complaints of uncompleted telephone
			 calls persist, with the most recent survey in October 2012 indicating a 41
			 percent increase in uncompleted calls between March and September of the same
			 year;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the National Exchange Carrier Association and
			 rural telecommunications carriers in April 2012 supplied information
			 that—</text>
      <paragraph id="idE84DED240A4D4D82B2E991CA44CD83FC">
        <enum>(1)</enum>
        <text>6.4 percent of

        <enum>(2)</enum>
        <text>11 percent of
			 calls to rural areas were either poor quality or were delayed, compared to only
			 5 percent in urban areas;</text>
      </paragraph>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="2700" entity-type="federal-body">Federal Communications Commission</cato:entity-ref> was made
			 aware of an issue regarding telephone service connection in rural areas in
			 November 2010 and has since issued a declaratory ruling and a notice of
			 proposed rulemaking with respect to the issue and has reached a settlement with
			 one telecommunications carrier;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in a declaratory ruling in February 2012, the
			 <cato:entity-ref entity-id="2700" entity-type="federal-body">Federal Communications Commission</cato:entity-ref> made it clear that blocking or otherwise
			 restricting telephone service is a violation of <cato:entity entity-type="law-citation">

			 which outlines the duty of a telecommunications carrier to refrain from

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas actions by the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="2700" entity-type="federal-body">Federal Communications Commission</cato:entity-ref>
			 have not significantly decreased the prevalence of telephone calls being
			 rerouted by telecommunications carriers and some States are seeing an increase
			 in complaints as of April 2013;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas telephone communications are vital to keeping
			 rural areas of the United States competitive in the economy, and a low rate of
			 telephone call completion results in economic injury to rural businesses,
			 including farmers, trucking companies, and suppliers who have seen thousands of
			 dollars in business lost when telephone calls are not completed;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the safety of the public is at risk from a lack of
			 quality telephone communications, including 911 services;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas schools depend on telephone calls to notify
			 students and parents of emergencies, and health care centers depend on
			 telecommunications services to save lives and to communicate with rural
			 patients;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas small, local telecommunications carriers are
			 losing valuable, multi-line business subscribers because of a lack of quality
			 telecommunications services, which is financially detrimental to those carriers
			 and adversely affects the rural communities served by those carriers;
			 and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it may cost a telecommunications carrier serving a
			 rural area hundreds of dollars to investigate each complaint of an uncompleted
			 telephone call: Now, therefore, be it</text>
