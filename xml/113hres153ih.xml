      <text>Whereas article I, section 7, clause 1 of the United
			 States Constitution provides that, <quote>All Bills for raising Revenue shall
			 originate in the House of Representatives</quote>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on June 28, 2012, a majority of the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1001">United States
			 Supreme Court</cato:entity-ref> held that the individual mandate provision of the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009">Patient
			 Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009</cato:entity-ref> <quote>cannot be upheld as an

		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <act-name>Patient Protection and Affordable
			 Care Act of 2009</act-name> was originally introduced in the United States
			 Congress by its sponsor as the <term>Senate health care bill</term> in the form
			 of a Senate Amendment to H.R. 3590, which had passed the House of
			 Representatives by a vote of 416–0 as the <quote>
          <act-name>Service Members Home
			 Ownership Tax Act of 2009</act-name>
        </quote>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is ample evidence that the sponsors of the
			 <term>Senate health care bill</term> not only contemplated the possibility of
			 substantial excess revenues, but explicitly announced on its Senate
			 introduction that, <quote>This bill will cut the deficit by $130
			 billion</quote>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas section 1563 of the Senate amended H.R. 3590
			 explicitly stated that it was the <quote>Sense of the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0010">Senate</cato:entity-ref> [that] this Act
			 will reduce the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019</quote>, and <quote>this
			 Act will continue to reduce budget deficits after 2019.</quote>; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <term>Senate health care bill</term> that the
			 <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1100">President</cato:entity-ref> ultimately signed as H.R. 3590 contains 17 numbered <term>Revenue
			 Provisions</term>, none of which are germane to the subject matter of the
