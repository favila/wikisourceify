			 school’s educational team, playing a central role in creating a positive school
			 climate and vital partnerships between the home, school, and community to

			 providing services to students who face serious challenges to school success,
			 including poverty, disability, discrimination, abuse, addiction, bullying,
			 divorce of parents, loss of a loved one, and other barriers to learning;</text>
