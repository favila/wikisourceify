	<preamble>
		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas on May 25, 1963, 32 newly independent African
			 countries signed the Charter of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
			 promote unity, solidarity, and political and economic cooperation among
			 themselves, and to defend member states’ sovereignty, territorial integrity,
			 and independence;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas upon its inception, the OAU embraced the
			 principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including freedom of
			 association, free expression, and political participation;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas such efforts to encourage African unity, advance
			 human rights, and promote economic development on the continent were undermined
			 by regional conflicts, military coups, and civil wars, as well as large foreign
			 debts, increasing trade imbalances, food insecurity, and inequity;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a decision declaring the establishment of the
			 African Union (AU) as a successor organization to the OAU to promote democratic
			 principles and institutions, encourage economic growth, and develop new tools
			 for the collective promotion of regional stability was adopted in Sirte, Libya,
			 on March 1, 2001, and March 2, 2001;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the vision of the African Union is that of
			 <quote>An integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own
			 citizens and representing a dynamic force in global arena</quote>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the African Union expresses commitment to the
			 essential values of transparency and accountability, and promotes democratic
			 processes across the continent of Africa;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the African Union departed from the OAU's abiding
			 doctrine of nonintervention in the internal affairs of member states in favor
			 of a new policy establishing the right of the AU to intervene in the affairs of
			 a member state under grave circumstances, including with respect to war crimes,
			 genocide, and crimes against humanity;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the African Union continues to build more robust
			 African regional institutions in order to address the myriad challenges facing
			 the continent, and has established an African peace and security architecture,
			 the New Partnership for Africa's Development, a strategic framework for
			 regional socioeconomic development, the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
			 Development Program, and the African Peer Review Mechanism, which seeks to help
			 advance good governance, among other institutions;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the African Union has contributed to regional
			 peace and security by mobilizing peacekeeping or intervention forces to protect
			 civilians or support political mediation missions, and peace-building processes
			 in Burundi, Comoros, Sudan, Somalia, and Mali;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas efforts to end conflicts on the continent of
			 Africa, which continue to destabilize states, undermine democracy, stifle
			 economic growth and investment, and rob young Africans of the opportunity for
			 an education and a better life, are a key United States objective;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is critical to the interests of the United
			 States that the African Union be well-resourced and capable of effectively
			 addressing current conflicts and preventing future ones, advancing
			 socioeconomic development and economic growth, and consolidating democracy and
			 good governance;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States Government demonstrated its
			 strong commitment to working closely with the AU by establishing a Mission to
			 the African Union in 2006;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas on August 3, 2010, the United States and the
			 African Union signed a $5,800,000 multi-year assistance agreement to achieve
			 common policy objectives in the areas of peace and security, economic
			 development, regional integration, health and social welfare, and good
			 governance on the African continent;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas on June 14, 2012, <cato:entity-ref entity-type="person" entity-id="O000167">President Obama</cato:entity-ref> announced a
			 United States Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa, which calls on the United
			 States to deepen its partnership with African countries and regional
			 organizations by supporting efforts to advance accountable, democratic
			 governance, and adherence to human rights norms and the rule of law,
			 particularly by supporting the African Union African Charter on Democracy,
			 Elections, and Governance and other multilateral standards;</text>
		</whereas>

			 include fostering peace and security, spuring economic growth, trade, and
			 investment; and promoting opportunity and development;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas on February 1, 2013, a Memorandum of Understanding
			 was signed between the United States and the African Union to cement
			 cooperation on peace and security; democracy, and governance, economic growth,
			 trade, and investment, and promotion of opportunity and development;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the African Union serves as a preeminent dialogue
			 and policy-making forum for African leaders seeking to advance a wide-range of
			 regional political, security, social, and economic objectives, including
			 sub-regional integration, and is a key interlocutor for and representative of
			 the people of Africa in international political and policy forums, including
			 the United Nations; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas close relations between the United States the
			 African Union mutually benefit the people of the United States and Africa and
			 the political, security, economic, and social relations that link them: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
