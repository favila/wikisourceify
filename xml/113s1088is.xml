			 correctly interpreted the prohibitions on sex discrimination to include
			 discrimination based on sex stereotypes and gender identity, even when that
			 sex-based discrimination coincides or overlaps with discrimination based on
			 sexual orientation. However, the absence of express Federal law prohibitions on
			 discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity has
			 created unnecessary uncertainty that risks limiting access to legal remedies
			 under Federal law for LGBT students and their parents.</text>
