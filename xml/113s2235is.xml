				<text>An

			 Of the 5,850,000 citizens barred from voting, only  25 percent are in

			 communities while on probation or parole or after having completed their
			 sentences.  Approximately 2,600,000 citizens who have completed their
			 sentences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws.    In 6

				<text>In those States

			 disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact racial and ethnic

			 Eight percent of the African-American population, or 2,000,000
			 African-Americans, are disenfranchised. Given current rates of
			 incarceration,
			 approximately 1 in 3 of the next generation of African-American men will
			 be
			 disenfranchised at some point during their lifetime. Currently, 1 of every
			 13 African-Americans are rendered unable to vote because of felony
			 disenfranchisement, which is a rate 4 times greater than non
			 African-Americans. 7.7
			 percent of African-Americans are disenfranchised whereas only 1.8 percent 
			 of non African-Americans are. In 3 States—Florida (23 percent), Kentucky
			 (22 percent), and Virginia (20 percent)—more than 1 in 5 African-Americans
			 are unable to vote because of prior convictions.</text>

        <text>Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate

			 When analyzing the data across 10 States,  Latinos generally have
			 disproportionately higher rates of disenfranchisement compared to their
			 presence  in the voting age population. In 6 out of 10 States studied in
			 2003, Latinos constitute more than 10 percent of the total number of
			 persons  disenfranchised by State felony laws. In 4 States (California, 37
