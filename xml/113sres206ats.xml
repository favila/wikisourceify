		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the National Cancer Institute estimates that, in
			 2013, nearly 240,000 men will be diagnosed with, and more than 29,000 men will

		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas 40 percent of newly diagnosed prostate cancer
			 cases occur in males under the age of 65;</text>

			 including prostate cancer;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas African-American males suffer from a prostate
			 cancer incidence rate that is up to 65 percent higher than that for white males

		</whereas>
    <whereas>
