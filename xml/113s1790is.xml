        <text>In 2010, the

			 HIV-specific criminal laws, stating: <quote>[W]hile we understand the intent
			 behind [these] laws, they may not have the desired effect and they may make
			 people less willing to disclose their status by making people feel at even
			 greater risk of discrimination. In some cases, it may be appropriate for
			 legislators to reconsider whether existing laws continue to further the public
			 interest and public health. In many instances, the continued existence and
			 enforcement of these types of laws run counter to scientific evidence about
			 routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of
			 promoting HIV screening and treatment.</quote>. The NHAS also states that State
			 legislatures should consider reviewing HIV-specific criminal statutes to ensure
			 that they are consistent with current knowledge of HIV transmission and support
			 public health approaches to preventing and treating HIV.</text>
