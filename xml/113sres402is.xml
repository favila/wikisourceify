		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas throughout the history of the United States, women have made and continue to make
			 invaluable contributions to society that strengthen the political, social,
			 and economic fabric of the Nation and improve the lives of countless
			 individuals;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas women in the United States have been and continue to be leaders in promoting justice and
			 equality during times of great difficulty for the Nation;</text>

			 Wisconsin,  stateless and without a nationality after marrying a foreign
			 national;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Expatriation Act of 1907/s:3">section 3 of the Expatriation Act
			 of 1907</cato:entity-ref> caused thousands of United States women, such as Lorella
			 Martorana from Pennsylvania who lost her
			 citizenship and was not able to vouch for her husband during his
			 naturalization proceedings, and Lena Weide Demke from South Dakota who
			 lost her citizenship and was almost deported during World War I, to have
			 their
			 loyalties questioned, face harassment, and be subject to deportation

      <text>Whereas <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Expatriation Act of 1907/s:3">section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907</cato:entity-ref> affected numerous women, such as Florence Bain
			 Gual, a
			 New York City school teacher whose tenure was stripped after 15 years

			 difficulties
			 providing for their families because they lost, or were not able to gain,

      <text>Whereas <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Expatriation Act of 1907/s:3">section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907</cato:entity-ref> prevented women in the United States, such as
			 Ethel MacKenzie from California who was unable to register to vote because
			 she married a
			 foreign national, from participating in the political process and casting
			 ballots in various elections;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Expatriation Act of 1907/s:3">section 3 of the Expatriation Act of 1907</cato:entity-ref> is similar to discriminatory State laws that
			 criminalized or nullified marriages between individuals of different

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the revocation of citizenship restricted the ability of numerous women in the United

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas an acknowledgment of the actions of the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="0010" entity-type="federal-body">Senate</cato:entity-ref> that have contributed to discrimination
			 against women
			 will not erase the past, but will highlight the injustices of the national

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="0010" entity-type="federal-body">Senate</cato:entity-ref> recognizes the importance of addressing the error of <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Expatriation Act of 1907/s:3">section 3 of the
