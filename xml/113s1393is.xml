        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">During World War II, more than 75,000 Jews
			 and thousands of other persons were deported from France to Nazi concentration
			 camps, on trains operated for profit by the Société Nationale des Chemins de
			 fer Français (in this Act referred to as <term>SNCF</term>), including
			 deportations to Auschwitz and Buchenwald. Numerous citizens and residents of
			 the United States were among those who were on the trains or had relatives on
			 the trains. United States servicemen who were pilots shot down over France were
			 also among the persons deported on the SNCF trains to Nazi concentration
			 camps.</text>

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The complaint filed alleges that SNCF, a
			 separate corporate entity that remained independent during World War II,
			 operated the deportation trains for a profit, as ordinary commercial
			 transactions. SNCF remained under French civilian control throughout World War
			 II and is alleged to have collaborated willingly with the German Nazi
			 regime.</text>

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The complaint alleges that SNCF provided
			 the necessary rolling stock, scheduled the departures, and supplied the
			 employees to operate the trains bound for the concentration camps. SNCF
			 allegedly charged an ordinary passenger coach fare for the deportations,
			 calculated per person and per kilometer, and considered these trains as
			 ordinary commercial activities. The plaintiffs further contend that SNCF herded
			 as many people as possible into each car, requiring passengers of all ages and
			 sexes, including the elderly and young children, to stand throughout the trip
			 of several days’ duration, with no provision for food or water and no sanitary
			 facilities. The complaint further alleges that SNCF cleaned the trains after
			 each trip, removing the corpses of persons who perished during transit due to
			 the execrable conditions of the train cars. The destination was in each case a
			 camp in which the deportees were to be exterminated, worked to death, or made
			 to suffer terrible and inhuman conditions.</text>

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The complaint contends that SNCF’s actions
			 violated the Principles of the Nuremberg Tribunal, 1950, relating to crimes
			 under international law (earlier recognized by the Martens Clause of the Hague
			 Convention IV of 1907), and aided and abetted the commission of war crimes and
			 crimes against humanity. SNCF has not denied its actions and has never
			 disgorged the money that it was paid for the deportations or otherwise
			 compensated the deportees or their heirs.</text>

			 it is one of the 500 largest corporations in the world, earns hundreds of
			 millions of dollars from its commercial activities in the United States, and is
			 not accorded sovereign immunity under the laws of France. SNCF’s motion to
			 dismiss the lawsuit was granted by the United States District Court for the
			 Eastern District of New York. Plaintiffs appealed the decision, their appeal
			 was granted, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. Subsequently,
			 in light of Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677 (2004), in November
			 2004, on remand, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recalled its prior
			 mandate and determined that SNCF was entitled to immunity and affirmed the
			 dismissal of the complaint. The Second Circuit stated that <quote>the
			 railroad’s conduct at the time lives on in infamy</quote> but concluded that
			 <quote>the evil actions of the French national railroad’s former private
			 masters in knowingly transporting thousands to death camps during World War II
			 are not susceptible to legal redress in Federal court today.</quote>.</text>

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">This lawsuit, which arises from the unique

			 United States. Many of those who have sought redress against SNCF are elderly
			 and would have difficulty traveling outside the United States in order to
			 pursue their claims elsewhere. The courts of the United States are and should
			 be a proper forum for this lawsuit. The <cato:entity-ref xmlns:cato="http://namespaces.cato.org/catoxml" entity-type="act" value="Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of
