        <text>Throughout the
			 world, an alarming number of children and youth are not receiving a basic
			 education. According to the Global Monitoring Report, approximately 57,000,000
			 children of primary school age are not in school and tens of millions drop out
			 of school annually. Globally, progress is slowing, and if current trends
			 continue, there could be as many as 72,000,000 children of primary school age
			 out of school in 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, the number of primary age
			 children out of school has remained at approximately 30,000,000 over the past
			 five years. Additionally, there were an estimated 69,000,000 adolescents not
			 enrolled in school in 2011 and an estimated 122,000,000 youth (15 to 24 years
			 old) who could not read and write in 2010, needing a second chance to acquire
			 even basic literacy and numeracy skills.</text>

			 approximately 57,000,000 children of primary school age and 69,000,000

			 percent were girls. The proportion of out-of-school primary age girls is
			 highest in Arab states, Central Asia, South and West Asia, and sub-Saharan
			 Africa. Over half of the world’s out-of-school children live in sub-Saharan
			 Africa, and more than 28,000,000 live in countries affected by conflict. A
			 significant number of such children have been orphaned or otherwise negatively
			 affected by HIV/AIDS, while others have been victims of child labor or human
			 trafficking. Of the estimated 120,000,000 to 150,000,000 children with
			 disabilities under the age of 18 around the world, an estimated 98 percent of
			 children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school.
			 Without access to quality education, such children will not have the skills to
			 contribute to reconstruction and stabilization of their countries.</text>
