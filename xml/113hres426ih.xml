<preamble>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas 1 in 5 children in the United States will experience the death of someone close to them by age 18, and 1,900,000 youngsters under age 18 have lost one or both parents;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas children who have had a loved one die, especially a close family member, can carry that loss within them forever, and it sometimes causes confusion in the mind of a young person about why their loved one was taken away;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the great majority of grieving children feel alone, not understood, and fearful, on top of their feelings of grief, leading in many cases to an inability to manage or even face their grief;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas many adults and other children erroneously believe that grieving children are resilient enough that they <quote>just get over</quote> their grief, so much so that children have often been called <quote>forgotten mourners</quote>;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas for many grieving children the most helpful reaction they can receive is an acknowledgment of their feelings, a listening ear, and the support of caring individuals, like family, friends, or others also grieving a loss;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas <quote>Children’s Grief Awareness Day</quote> began through grassroots efforts in 2008 in order to help others understand the impact of death on children and their need for support, and to provide ways for caring adults and young people to show their support and solidarity for grieving children;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas <quote>Children’s Grief Awareness Day</quote> is observed every year on the Thursday before Thanksgiving, immediately preceding the winter holidays which can be a particularly difficult time for grieving children;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas simple ways to participate are to engage in activities that raise the awareness of the needs of grieving children and to encourage as many people as possible to wear blue on that day as a symbol of support for these children;</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas this year, on November 21, 2013, and on November 20, 2014, thousands of children and adults from all walks of life from across the United States will join together to show their support for grieving children by participating in <quote>Children’s Grief Awareness Day</quote>; and</text>
    </whereas>
<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Thursday before Thanksgiving would be an appropriate day to designate as <quote>Children’s Grief Awareness Day</quote> to help the public understand the devastating impact of the death of a loved one on a child, and of the child’s need for support: Now, therefore, be it</text>
