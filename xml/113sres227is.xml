			 and issued orders that the Danes deport all Danish Jews to concentration camps
			 where the Jews would eventually be exterminated;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Danish people, as a result of the Nazi
			 mandate, refused to accept the prosecution of the Jews and began a mission of
			 mercy on October 1, 1943, smuggling Jews across the Oresund Strait to neutral
			 Sweden via small boats and fishing cutters;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Danish rescuers unselfishly risked their own
			 lives, avoiding German patrols for weeks during the rescue operations;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas approximately 90 percent of the Danish Jews were
			 saved from certain death at the hands of the Nazis by the sheer courage and
			 compassion demonstrated by the Danes; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is imperative that future generations continue
			 to remember and understand what happened so that the horrors of the Holocaust
			 will never be repeated: Now, therefore, be it</text>
