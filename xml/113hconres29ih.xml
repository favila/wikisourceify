		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the people of Taiwan have established a vibrant
			 and pluralistic democracy only 20 years ago;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas since then, the people of Taiwan have conducted
			 five successful presidential elections, successive elections for members of
			 their national legislature, numerous local elections, and two national
			 referendums;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Taiwan has never been under the jurisdiction of
			 the People’s Republic of China, which continues to illegitimately claim
			 sovereignty over Taiwan and its 23,000,000 citizens;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Shanghai Communique, which maintains that
			 there is “One China” and that “Taiwan is part of China”, was established
			 without the consultation of Congress or the people of Taiwan;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the People’s Republic of China has since used the
			 “One China Policy” to block Taiwan's membership and full participation in
			 international organizations and events, ranging from the United Nations and the
			 World Health Organization to the Olympics;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the “One China Policy” is effectively obsolete,
			 and does not the reflect the obvious reality that Taiwan has functioned as an
			 independent and sovereign country for over half a century;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the only other countries in the world with which
			 the United States does not have diplomatic relations are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran,
			 and North Korea;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Taiwan maintains diplomatic, cultural, and
			 economic relations with several countries around the world;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Taiwan and the United States maintained formal
			 diplomatic relations until 1979;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas former President Jimmy Carter severed diplomatic
			 ties with Taiwan in 1979 and terminated the Mutual Defense Treaty between the
			 United States and Taiwan without consulting or seeking the approval of
			 <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref>;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Congress responded later that year by adopting the
			 Taiwan Relations Act, codifying in law the basis for continued friendly
			 relations between the United States and Taiwan;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas former President Ronald Reagan issued the “Six
			 Assurances” to Taiwan in July 1982, including the assurance that “[t]he United
			 States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.”;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas both the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six
			 Assurances form the cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Taiwan has been a steadfast ally of the United
			 States and a responsible and compassionate member of the world community: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
		</whereas>
