		<whereas>

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the European Parliament resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism of April 2,

			 remembrance for victims of Communist and Nazi regimes to remember and
			 commemorate their victims;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>

			 political repression of the people through arbitrary executions, mass
			 arrests, deportations, the suppression of free speech, confiscation of
			 private property, and the destruction of cultural and moral identity and
			 civil society, all of which deprived the vast majority of the peoples of

			 separating them from the democratic world by means of the Iron Curtain and
			 the Berlin Wall; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the memories of Europe’s tragic past cannot be forgotten in order to honor the victims,
