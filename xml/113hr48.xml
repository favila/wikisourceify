        <text>Farmers and

        <text>In areas where
			 State law requires debt assumed by a municipality to be structured in the form
			 of a sinking fund, farmers and landowners may be discouraged from selling the
			 development rights of their land for conservation purposes. Since sales to
			 State and local governments will be in the form of a sinking fund, a seller may
			 not be able to pay capital gains taxes in full when the seller will not receive
			 cash payments until a future date.</text>

        <text>In urban fringe

			 open spaces and enjoying environmental benefits. Communities will greatly
			 benefit by the Federal Government taking steps to assist municipalities in the
