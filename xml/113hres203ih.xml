      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for

      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas children in foster care who are placed with
			 relatives, compared to children placed with nonrelatives, have more stability,

      </whereas>
      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3

      <whereas>
        <text>Whereas children entering foster care often confront the
