    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, according to the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="1549">Federal Bureau of Investigation</cato:entity-ref>, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of American children are at risk for commercial sexual exploitation;</text>

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas many child sex trafficking victims who have not yet attained the age of consent are arrested and detained for juvenile prostitution or status offenses directly related to their exploitation: Now, therefore, be it</text>
