		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Constitution’s makers entrusted decisions to
			 initiate offensive warfare not in self-defense exclusively to <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref> in
			 article I, section 8, clause 11;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Constitution’s makers knew that the Executive
			 Branch would be prone to manufacture danger and to deceive <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref> and the
			 United States people to justify gratuitous wars to aggrandize executive
			 power;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas chronic wars are irreconcilable with liberty, a
			 separation of powers, and the rule of law;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the entry of the United States Armed Forces into
			 the ongoing war in Syria to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad would make the
			 United States less safe by awakening new enemies;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the fate of Syria is irrelevant to the security
			 and welfare of the United States and its citizens and is not worth risking the
			 life of a single member of the United States Armed Forces;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas humanitarian wars are a contradiction in terms and
			 characteristically lead to semi-anarchy and chaos, as in Somalia and
			 Libya;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas if victorious, the hydra-headed Syrian insurgency
			 would suppress the Christian population or other minorities as has been
			 similarly witnessed in Iraq with its Shiite-dominated government; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas United States military aid to the Syrian
			 insurgents risks blowback indistinguishable from the military assistance
			 provided to the splintered Afghan mujahideen in Afghanistan to oppose the
			 Soviet Union and culminated in the 9/11 abominations: Now, therefore, be
			 it</text>
