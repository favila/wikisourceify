			 Board of Education, Motley was trial or appellate counsel in 57 civil rights
			 cases in the United States Supreme Court, 82 cases in Federal courts of
			 appeals, 48 cases in Federal district courts, and numerous cases in State
			 courts. She argued four appeals in desegregation cases in one day. She won
			 cases that ended de jure segregation in White only restaurants and lunch
			 counters. She protected the right of protestors to march, sit-in, freedom ride,
			 and demonstrate in other ways. She represented Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and
			 other jailed civil rights activists and forced their release when they were
			 arrested and locked up in Southern jails. She secured the right for Blacks to
			 register, vote, and have access to the political power structure. She won
			 education desegregation cases in almost every State in the South and the
			 District of Columbia and secured the right for Blacks to attend formerly all
			 White public schools, colleges, and universities including the representation
			 of James Meredith against the University of Mississippi, Charlayne Hunter Gault
			 and Hamilton Holmes against the University of Georgia, Autherine Lucy against
			 the University of Alabama, Harvey Gantt against Clemson College, and Ernest
			 Morial against Louisiana State University. Without her victories in the
			 courtroom, the goal of ending racial segregation in public schools, colleges,
			 and universities, public accommodations, and voting—a goal of the Civil Rights
			 Movement—may not have been achieved.</text>

			 which mandated the reinstatement of over 1,000 school children who had been
			 expelled from school for demonstrating with Dr. King in Birmingham fifty years
			 ago. She represented <term>Freedom Riders</term> who rode buses to test the
			 Supreme Court's 1960 ruling prohibiting segregation in interstate
			 transportation. She protected the right of Blacks to ride and sit in any vacant
			 seat on buses and trains, to use bathroom facilities and drink from fountains
			 in bus and train stations, to be served and eat at lunch counters and
			 restaurants, to vote, stay in hotels, and to go to parks, museums, and places
			 of public accommodations on an equal basis with Whites. She won the case in the
			 Supreme Court that led to the reversal of all arrests and convictions of all of
