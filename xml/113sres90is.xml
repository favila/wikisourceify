  <preamble>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government and people of the United States
			 stand with the people of Kenya following their national and local elections on
			 March 4, 2013;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Governments of the United States and Kenya
			 have long shared a strong bilateral partnership, and Kenya plays a critically
			 important role as a cornerstone of stability in East Africa and as a valued
			 ally of the United States;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Kenya’s disputed 2007 presidential election
			 threatened the country’s stability and its democratic trajectory, triggering an
			 explosion of violence that resulted in the deaths of some 1,140 civilians and
			 displaced nearly 600,000, some of whom have still not returned home;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a mediation effort by former United Nations
			 Secretary-General Kofi Annan and an African Union Panel of Eminent African
			 Personalities, supported by the United States, led to the signing of the
			 National Accord on February 28, 2008, which facilitated a power-sharing
			 arrangement and led to a series of constitutional, electoral, and institutional
			 reforms to address underlying causes of the crisis;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, as part of that reform process, the citizens of
			 Kenya participated in a national referendum in August 2010, approving a new
			 constitution that mandated significant institutional and structural changes to
			 the government;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas those constitutional changes have led to important
			 reforms in the judicial sector and the electoral system in Kenya that aim to
			 build greater public confidence in government institutions, and which
			 demonstrate meaningful progress;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Kenya’s Independent Commission of Inquiry into the
			 Post-Election Violence (the<quote>Waki Commission</quote>) concluded from its
			 investigation in 2008 that there had been<quote>no serious effort by any
			 government</quote>to punish perpetrators of previous incidents of ethnic and
			 political violence, leading to a culture of impunity that contributed to the
			 crisis that followed the 2007 elections, and, since then, despite laudable
			 judicial reforms, few perpetrators or organizers of that violence have been
			 held accountable for their crimes in Kenyan courts;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, based on the findings of the Waki Commission,
			 mediator Kofi Annan submitted a list of key suspects to the Office of the
			 Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2009, and several have
			 been subsequently charged at the ICC with crimes against humanity;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Department of State’s 2011 Human Rights Report
			 on Kenya notes,<quote>Widespread impunity at all levels of government
			 continued to be a serious problem. The government took only limited action
			 against security forces suspected of unlawful killings, and impunity in cases
			 of corruption was common. Although the government took action in some cases to
			 prosecute officials who committed abuses, impunity … was
			 pervasive</quote>;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas<cato:entity-ref entity-type="person" entity-id="O000167">President Barack Obama’s</cato:entity-ref>Strategy on Sub-Saharan
			 Africa, released in June 2012, states that the United States will not stand by
			 while actors<quote>… manipulate the fairness and integrity of democratic
			 processes, and we will stand in steady partnership with those who are committed
			 to the principles of equality, justice and the rule of law</quote>;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, prior to the March 2013 elections, concerns about
			 political violence in Kenya were high, and in the months preceding there had
			 been strong indications that local politicians in various parts of the country
			 were involved in organizing or inciting violence in order to influence local
			 electoral outcomes;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in a February 2013 message to the people of
			 Kenya,<cato:entity-ref entity-type="person" entity-id="O000167">President Obama</cato:entity-ref>highlighted the power Kenyan communities have to reject
			 intimidation and violence surrounding the upcoming election, resolve disputes
			 in the courts as opposed to the streets, and<quote>move forward towards
			 prosperity and opportunity that unleashes the extraordinary talents of your
			 people</quote>;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, five years after Kenya’s post-election crisis,
			 the country held its first general elections under the new constitution on
			 March 4, 2013, which were largely peaceful; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Kenya’s presidential candidates and their
			 political parties committed themselves to a peaceful electoral process, and to
			 resolving any resulting disputes through the judicial process, which is now
			 underway with the filing of cases before the Kenyan Supreme Court on March 16,
			 2013: Now, therefore, be it</text>
