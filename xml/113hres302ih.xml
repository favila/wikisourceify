			 respective countries on which they based their hopes for a better future for
			 the world</quote> and <quote>the right of all peoples to choose the form of
			 government under which they will live and self government restored to those who
			 have been forcibly deprived of them</quote> and that the people of countries
			 may live in freedom;</text>
		</whereas>

			 advocated for and continues to support the principles by the United Nations
			 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations General Assembly
			 resolution 260 (III) of December 9, 1948;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Captive Nations Week, signed into law by President
			 Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, raised public awareness of the oppression of
			 nations under the control of Communist and other nondemocratic
			 governments;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the European Parliament resolution on European
			 conscience and totalitarianism of April 2, 2009, and the <quote>Black Ribbon
			 Day</quote> resolution adopted by the Parliament of Canada on November 30,
			 2009, establish a day of remembrance for victims of Communist and Nazi regimes
			 to remember and commemorate their victims;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the extreme forms of totalitarian rule practiced
			 by the Soviet Communist and Nazi regimes led to premeditated and vast crimes

		</whereas>

      <text>Whereas fleeing the Nazi and Soviet Communist crimes,

			 than 40 years by ruthless military, economic, and political repression of the
			 people through arbitrary executions, mass arrests, deportations, the
			 suppression of free speech, confiscation of private property, and the
			 destruction of cultural and moral identity and civil society, all of which
			 deprived the vast majority of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe of
			 their basic human rights and dignity, separating them from the democratic world
			 by means of the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the memories of Europeâ€™s tragic past cannot be
			 forgotten in order to honor the victims, condemn the perpetrators, and lay the
			 foundation for reconciliation based on truth and remembrance: Now, therefore,
			 be it</text>
