        <text>According to a
			 study from Education Week and the Journal of the American Medical Association
			 fewer than 4 in 10 elementary-aged children achieved the recommended guidelines
			 for physical activity (60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity) and
			 television viewing (less than 2 hours per day of television screen time). As
			 children get older, their prevalence of sedentary behavior increased.</text>

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">During the 1950s, the United States began
			 experiencing a physical inactivity crisis. The issue garnered sufficient
			 attention that the Eisenhower Administration expressed concern about the United
			 States meeting its Cold War military manpower needs. In response, the
			 President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports was established in 1956
			 under the name of the <quote>President's Council on Youth Fitness</quote>.

        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">A 2009 study published in a supplement to
			 the International Journal of Obesity found no association between particular
			 segments of the diet and subsequent weight gain. Another key point from the
			 study is that obesity is a complex, multifactorial issue that can be caused in
			 part by genetic susceptibility, behavior, and level of physical
			 activity.</text>

			 blood pressure by almost 50 percent, reduces the incidence of diabetes by 50
			 percent, can reduce mortality and the risk of recurrent breast cancer by almost
			 50 percent, can lower the risk of colon cancer by over 60 percent, can reduce

        <text>A
