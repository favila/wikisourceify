    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas children with bone cancer courageously face painful and disfiguring surgeries, grueling physical therapy, the side effects from the harshest of chemotherapies, lost time from school, and the social stigma among teens physical disabilities, scars, hair loss, weight loss, and absence from school;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the parents, siblings, and families of children with bone cancer face unique difficulties, including separation of family for extended periods of time during treatment, difficulties in providing parental guidance to the children in the family who are not afflicted with cancer, financial strains over several years, and the emotional strain of watching a child suffer through treatment and often die a painful death after years of struggling;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
