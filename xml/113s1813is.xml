			 earthquake will strike in California in the next 30 years and that there is a
			 46 percent chance that a magnitude 7.5 earthquake will strike in California in

          <text>Despite the known
			 risk of earthquakes, relatively few homeowners have earthquake insurance. For
			 example, in California, 88 percent of homes insured for fire do not have
			 earthquake insurance. In the event of a catastrophic earthquake, the lack of
			 homeowner earthquake-insurance coverage will slow recovery, create economic
			 hardship, and increase the risk of mortgage and other credit defaults and
			 adversely affect the banking system of the United States.</text>
