			 1,500,000 men, women, and children were killed and 500,000 survivors were
			 expelled from their homes, and the elimination of the over 2,500-year
			 presence of Armenians in their historic homeland;</text>

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term <quote>genocide</quote>, and whose draft resolution for a genocide convention treaty became the framework for the United
			 Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
			 Genocide, recognized the Armenian Genocide as the type of crime the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="19UN" entity-type="federal-body">United
			 Nations</cato:entity-ref> should prevent and punish through the setting of international
			 standards;</text>

			 of this country may give expression to their sympathy by contributing
			 funds now being raised for the relief of the Armenians</quote>, who at the time were enduring <quote>starvation, disease, and untold suffering</quote>;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas <cato:entity-ref entity-type="bill-by-number" value="66/sres/359">Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress</cato:entity-ref>, agreed to May 11, 1920, stated that <quote>the testimony adduced at the hearings conducted by the subcommittee of the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="committee" entity-id="SSFR00">Senate Committee on
			 Foreign Relations</cato:entity-ref> have clearly established the truth of the reported
			 massacres and other atrocities from which the Armenian people have
