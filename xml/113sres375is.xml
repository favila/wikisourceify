	<preamble>
		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas, for more than 50 years, successive governments in the Central African Republic have
			 struggled to build a durable system of democratic institutions, to
			 effectively secure and control the country’s territory and borders, and to
			 ensure a basic level of socio-economic development for the country's
			 people;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, despite its natural resource wealth, the Central African Republic remains one of the
			 poorest countries in the world and one of the lowest ranking countries in
			 terms of a human development index according to the United Nations
			 Development Program;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in January 2013, regional leaders brokered the Libreville Agreements between the
			 government
			 of then-President Francois Bozize and the loosely allied rebel militia
			 known
			 as Séléka, which resulted in the formation of a government of national
			 unity;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, despite the Libreville Agreements, President Bozize was ousted in March 2013 by the Séléka
			 coalition, and the Séléka leader, Michel Djotodia, declared himself
			 president;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in April 2013, regional leaders issued the N’djamena Declaration in an effort to pursue a
			 return to constitutional order based on the Libreville Agreements;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas an influx of foreign fighters, especially from Chad and Sudan, has been a major factor in
			 the increased number of Séléka fighters, from approximately 5,000 in March
			 2013, to an estimated	20,000 as of December 2013;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas both Séléka forces and armed militia groups known as <quote>anti-balakas</quote>,  which formed initially as a means of protecting communities against Séléka, have been implicated
			 in
			 ethnically-motivated violence and grave and systemic human rights abuses
			 against civilians;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, over the course of the crisis, Séléka and anti-balaka groups have displayed weak control
			 and command structures, and committed war crimes with impunity;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, according to <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" value="UNICEF" entity-parent-id="19UN">UNICEF</cato:entity-ref>, thousands of child soldiers are involved in armed groups in the
			 Central African Republic, amid the near-total collapse of the country’s
			 primary education system;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas interethnic, intercommunal, and interreligious tensions and violence have risen to alarming
			 levels and led to systematic human rights abuses in the Central African
			 Republic, including targeted
			 killings, rapes, acts of torture, looting, and arbitrary detention;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States Embassy in Bangui closed on December 25, 2012, and the ordered departure
			 of
			 country team staff has temporarily suspended the diplomatic
			 presence and consular services of the United States in the Central African
			 Republic;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas more than 700,000 civilians have been internally displaced; another 230,000 have recently
			 sought refuge in neighboring countries, including the Democratic Republic
			 of the Congo, Chad, Cameroon, and South Sudan; 2,600,000 people, or over
			 half of the population of the Central African Republic, are in need of
			 humanitarian assistance; and 60 percent  of households have no available
			 food stocks;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas a failure of the international community to appropriately respond to and address the
			 rapidly deteriorating situation in the Central
			 African Republic could result in
			 further atrocities, mass displacement, and protracted instability with
			 significant repercussions for regional and international security;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127 (2013) called for urgent and increased
			 international assistance to the African Union International Support
			 Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA) to ensure that the force
			 can fulfill its mandate to restore security and protect civilians, and
			 placed an arms embargo on the Central African Republic;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127 requested the Secretary-General to
			 establish an international commission of inquiry to investigate reports of
			 human rights abuses in the Central African Republic in order to ensure
			 accountability for perpetrators of violence;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic has been
			 hindered by a lack of resources and constrained by insecurity;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127, the Government of France
			 launched a peacekeeping operation, Operation Sangaris, in the Central
			 African Republic to assist MISCA in fulfilling its mandate;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on March 3, 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recommended to the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" value="United Nations Security Council" entity-parent-id="19UN">United
			 Nations
			 Security Council</cato:entity-ref> a transition to a <cato:entity-ref entity-id="19UN" entity-type="federal-body">United Nations</cato:entity-ref> peacekeeping mission
			 with a primary mandate to protect civilians; and</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the United States Government is providing support for conflict resolution efforts,
			 humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons, and
			 assistance to troop contributing countries to
			 MISCA in order
			 to restore security in the Central African Republic, primarily by
			 providing airlift, non-lethal equipment, military logistics, and training,
			 as well as
			 logistical support for France: Now, therefore, be it</text>
