        <enum>(6)</enum>
        <text>According to the American Cancer Society, immediate breast reconstruction offers the advantage of combining the breast cancer surgery with the reconstructive surgery and is cost effective, while delayed breast reconstruction may be advantageous in women who require post-surgical radiation or other treatments.</text>

        <text>A 2007 study by Amy Alderman, M.D. at the University of Michigan reported that up to 70 percent of women eligible for breast reconstruction are not informed of their reconstructive options by their general surgeon.</text>

<paragraph id="H9C2CF4DCB8DF4BD7BCD391ABDBB5FDDA">
        <enum>(10)</enum>
        <text>A 2003 study by Alderman and others found that race is a significant predictor of reconstruction. Compared with the odds of reconstruction for Caucasians, the odds of reconstruction for African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians are significantly less.</text>
      </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HDCE992F324FE4C79972B13B4D440ABDA">
        <enum>(11)</enum>
        <text>A 2007 study by Caprice Greenberg, M.D. of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute and others found that Hispanic patients were less likely to receive reconstruction. This may be because of language barriers between the patient and provider. Although 72 percent of patients who primarily spoke English went on to receive reconstruction after discussing it with their providers, no patient in the study with a primary language other than English went on to receive reconstruction.</text>

        <enum>(12)</enum>
        <text>A 2009 study by Alderman and others also found that the relationship between race and reconstruction rates persisted when demographic and clinical factors were controlled for. Minority women are significantly less likely than Caucasians to see a plastic surgeon before initial surgery, were most likely to desire more information about reconstruction, and satisfaction was lowest among minority women without reconstruction.</text>

        <enum>(13)</enum>
        <text>The low use of reconstruction for minorities is not explained by lower demand for the procedure. Lower health literacy, financial issues, and less access to plastic surgeons emerged as barriers to reconstruction in the 2009 Alderman study. These results suggest that there is a substantial unmet need for information, especially among racial and ethnic minority groups regarding reconstruction options and coverage required by the <cato:entity-ref xmlns:cato="http://namespaces.cato.org/catoxml" entity-type="act" value="Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998" proposed="true">Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998</cato:entity-ref>.</text>

        <text>A 2010 study by Warren H. Tseng, M.D. and others at the University of California, Davis found that patients from rural areas are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer than their urban counterparts.</text>
