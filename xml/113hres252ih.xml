		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas democracy, human rights, and civil liberties are
			 universal values and fundamental principles of United States foreign
			 policy;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas an essential element of democratic self-government
			 is for leaders to be chosen and regularly held accountable through elections
			 that are organized and conducted in a manner that is free, fair, inclusive, and
			 consistent with international standards;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas governments whose power does not derive from free
			 and fair elections lack democratic legitimacy;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is
			 a signatory to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political
			 Rights, adopted December 16, 1966 (ICCPR), which states that every citizen has
			 the right to vote “at genuine periodic elections” that reflect “the free
			 expression of the will of the electors”;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
			 regularly violates its obligations under the ICCPR, holding elections that are
			 neither free nor fair nor consistent with international standards;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas elections in Iran are marred by the
			 disqualification of candidates based on their political views; the absence of
			 credible international observers; severe restrictions on freedom of expression,
			 assembly, and association, including censorship, surveillance, and disruptions
			 in telecommunications, and the absence of a free media; widespread intimidation
			 and repression of candidates, political parties, and citizens; and systemic
			 electoral fraud and manipulation;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the last nationwide election held in Iran, on June
			 12, 2009, was widely condemned inside Iran and throughout the world as neither
			 free nor fair and provoked large-scale peaceful protests throughout
			 Iran;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, following the June 12, 2009, election, the
			 Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran responded to peaceful protests with
			 a large-scale campaign of politically motivated violence, intimidation, and
			 repression, including acts of torture, cruel and degrading treatment in
			 detention, rape, executions, extrajudicial killings, and indefinite
			 detention;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, on December 26, 2011, the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" value="United Nations General Assembly" entity-parent-id="19UN">United Nations General
			 Assembly</cato:entity-ref> passed a resolution denouncing the serious human rights abuses
			 occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas no woman has ever been permitted to run for
			 president by the Council of Guardians;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas authorities in Iran have announced that nationwide
			 elections for the presidency and for municipal councils will be held in June
			 2013;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas no international election observers are scheduled
			 to oversee the June 2013 elections;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
			 continues to hold candidates from the 2009 election under house arrest and
			 dissidents in indefinite detention; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
			 seeks to prevent the people of Iran from accessing news and information by
			 incarcerating more journalists than any other country in the world, according
			 to a 2011 report from the Committee to Protect Journalists; disrupting access
			 to the Internet, including blocking e-mail and social networking sites and
			 limiting access to foreign news and Web sites, developing a national Internet
			 that will facilitate government censorship of news and information, and jamming
			 international broadcasts such as the Voice of America’s Persian News Network
			 and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Radio Farda: Now, therefore, be it</text>
