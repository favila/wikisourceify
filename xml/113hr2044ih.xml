        <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The toxicity of atrazine is well documented
			 and has shown to have adverse endocrine effects in amphibians, mammals, and
			 humans. There is evidence that atrazine exposure is associated with small birth
			 weight, abnormal development of the gut wall in infants, and spontaneous
			 abortions. In laboratory mammals, exposure is associated with abnormal
			 reproductive system development, impaired prostate gland formation, and
			 abnormal breast tissue development. In aquatic wildlife, exposure is associated
			 with abnormal reproductive system development, impaired reproduction, and
			 impaired immune system function.</text>

			 atrazine in approximately 85 percent of stream waters and 40 percent of all
			 ground water samples from agricultural areas tested. The United States
			 Geological Survey has found that atrazine has the highest frequency of
			 detection of all pesticides in agricultural streams, and the highest frequency
			 of detection of all herbicides in urban streams. According to data from the
			 Environmental Protection Agency Ecological Watershed Monitoring Program, the
			 surface water sampled in the Midwestern and Southern United States suffers from
			 pervasive atrazine contamination. Sampling of watersheds between 2004 and 2006
			 showed that all 40 watersheds tested had detectable levels of atrazine, and 25
			 watersheds had average concentrations above 1 ppb. While these average elevated
			 concentrations of atrazine are worrisome, high peak concentrations may also be
			 dangerous. Nine watersheds had at least one sample showing levels above 50 ppb,
			 and four watersheds had levels above 100 ppb.</text>
