		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas Benedict XVI, Pope Emeritus, a man of monumental
			 courage and humility, whose unceasing love and devotion to the ministry of
			 Christ helped steward the Catholic Church and the faithful through the daunting
			 challenges of the 21st century;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Benedict leaves behind an enduring legacy, both as
			 renowned theologian and kind-hearted leader who balanced the august splendor of
			 the papacy with a gentle humanity, and masterfully communicated the timeless
			 morality of the Church in a crusade against the modern evils of relativism,
			 materialism, and consumerism;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the election to the papacy of His Holiness Pope
			 Francis, formerly Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, marks a
			 groundbreaking moment in the life of the Catholic Church, elevating a marvelous
			 suitor to lead the world’s largest apostolic Christian ministry;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Pope Francis has inspired a vibrant sense of
			 reform and spiritual renewal in the Church, representing the first pontiff born
			 in the New World, the first hailing from Latin America, and the first prelate
			 ordained in the renowned Society of Jesus or Jesuits;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Pope’s chosen regnal name of Francis, after
			 St. Francis of Assisi, as well as his unrivaled reputation as a personally
			 devoted minister to the needs of the poor and outcast, emphasizes the
			 opportunities and obligations of mankind to serve a missionary role in
			 advancing peace, social justice, and moral contemplation for the betterment of
			 all God’s children;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas as President of the Argentine Episcopal
			 Conference, Pope Francis’ experience as spiritual guide and premiere pastoral
			 administrator of one of the Holy See’s largest and most active diocese reveals
			 his unique ability to accomplish much needed reforms in the Vatican and sustain
			 a growing Church in the world’s developing communities in Latin America,
			 Africa, and Asia; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas Pope Francis’ striking humility and simple
			 gentleness empowers him to connect with and renew the hearts of the faithful
			 and heal the recent wounds of the Church: Now, therefore, be it</text>
