			 districts in every State and territory of the United States;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas national wildlife refuges are important
			 recreational and tourism destinations in communities across the United States,

			 manages: hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, environmental
			 education, and interpretation;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in 2013,  364 units of the National Wildlife
			 Refuge System have hunting programs and  303 units of the National

			 hunting visits and nearly 7,000,000 fishing visits each year;</text>
    </whereas>

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System experiences
			 nearly 47,000,000 visits each year, which generated more than

			 2011;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses

			 islands, and spans 12 time zones from the Virgin Islands to Guam;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas national wildlife refuges are home to more than
			 700 species of birds, 220 species of mammals, 250 species of reptiles and

			 lands that foster production, migration, and wintering habitat for
			 waterfowl;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, since 1934, the sale of the Federal Duck Stamp to
			 outdoor enthusiasts has generated more than $850,000,000 in funds, which has

			 in the National Wildlife Refuge System;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the recovery of 386 threatened and endangered species is supported on refuge lands;</text>
    </whereas>

			 opportunity for children to discover and gain a greater appreciation for the
			 natural world;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, because there are national wildlife refuges
			 located in several urban and suburban areas and one refuge located within an
			 hour drive of every metropolitan area in the United States, national wildlife

			 exploring, connecting with, and preserving the natural heritage of the United
			 States;</text>

			 available to enjoy this network of protected lands: Now, therefore, be
			 it</text>
