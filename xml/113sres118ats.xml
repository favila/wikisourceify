		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive,
			 neurological disease and is the second most common neurological disease in the
			 United States;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is inadequate comprehensive data on the
			 incidence and prevalence of Parkinson’s disease, nevertheless it is estimated
			 that the disease affects 500,000 to 1,500,000 people in the United States and
			 the prevalence will more than double by 2040;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there are millions of Americans who are
			 caregivers, family members, and friends greatly impacted by Parkinson’s disease
			 every day;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is estimated that the economic burden of
			 Parkinson’s disease is $14,400,000,000, including indirect costs to patients
			 and family members each year;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas although research suggests the cause of
			 Parkinson’s disease is a combination of genetic and environmental factors, the
			 exact cause and progression of the disease is still unknown;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is no objective test or biomarker for
			 Parkinson’s disease, and the rate of misdiagnosis can be high;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease vary from
			 person to person and include tremors, slowness of movement, difficulty with
			 balance, swallowing, chewing, speaking, rigidity, cognitive impairment,
			 dementia, mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety, constipation, skin
			 problems, and sleep difficulties;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas there is currently no cure, therapy, or drug to
			 slow or halt the progression of Parkinson’s disease;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson’s
			 disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with dose-limiting side
			 effects, and ultimately lose their effectiveness, leaving the person unable to
			 move, speak or swallow; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas increased education and research are needed to
			 find more effective treatments with fewer side effects and, ultimately, an
			 effective treatment or cure for Parkinson’s disease: Now, therefore, be
			 it</text>
		</whereas>
