		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the shipment of F–16 fighter aircraft to Egypt is
			 scheduled for completed delivery by the end of 2013;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the agreement to provide these military aircraft
			 to Egypt originated in 2009 when the proposal was brought to <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="0001">Congress</cato:entity-ref> for
			 purchase and delivery of these aircraft through the Foreign Military Financing
			 (FMF) Program;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas these aircraft were intended for receipt by the
			 Government of Egypt under the leadership of President Hosni Mubarak;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas in the 3 years it has taken for the procurement of
			 these aircraft, Egypt has undergone significant changes in their government,
			 including a revolution and the installment of a new leader, Mohamed Morsi, a
			 former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas recent and previous statements by President Morsi
			 indicate a clear hostility towards non-Muslims in Egypt as well as towards the
			 United States and its allies—particularly Israel;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the instability of the region is also evident from
			 the continued anti-government protests that have resulted in at least 50 deaths

      <text>Whereas President Morsi granted emergency powers to the
			 Egyptian military to arrest Egyptian civilians and serve as a police force in

			 but, given the facts, we believe that United States military support of this
			 newly established government must become conditional;</text>

    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas referring to Egypt in September 2012, President
			 Obama stated: <quote>I don’t think that we would consider them an
