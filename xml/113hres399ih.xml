    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas studies have shown that small businesses are frequently the target of cyberattacks due to their less comprehensive defenses and that small businesses incur a significantly higher per capita cost per cyber incident than do larger companies;</text>
    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas critical infrastructure systems in the United States rely on the secure and reliable operation of information networks to support the United States Armed Forces, civilian government, energy, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, health care, and emergency response systems;</text>

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
